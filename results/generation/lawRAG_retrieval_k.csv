"An individual in removal proceedings had their application for asylum and other relief denied due to failure to submit biometrics, despite being previously instructed by the Immigration Judge while pro se. They subsequently retained counsel, who also failed to advise them about the biometrics requirement. After the denial, and more than 90 days after the final order of removal, they filed a motion to reopen, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel prevented a merits hearing and that this justified equitable tolling of the filing deadline. They also requested *sua sponte* reopening by the Board of Immigration Appeals. Could this individual successfully overturn the denial of their motion to reopen based on equitable tolling due to counsel's ineffectiveness or compel the BIA to *sua sponte* reopen their case?","No, the individual could not successfully overturn the denial of their motion to reopen based on equitable tolling or compel the BIA to *sua sponte* reopen their case. The court found that even if counsel's failure to remind about biometrics was ineffective, there was no argument that counsel's ineffectiveness caused the motion to reopen itself to be untimely filed. The failure to move in a timely fashion to reopen was an independent basis for denying relief, and the individual failed to show any basis for equitable tolling of the filing deadline for reopening. Additionally, the court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA's discretionary decision not to invoke its *sua sponte* authority to reopen a case.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['eneugwu v. garland', 'ramos-portillo v. barr', 'garcia v. garland', 'diaz v. sessions', 'lugo-resendez v. lynch', 'united states v. english', 'rashidi v. american president lines', 'mejia v. whitaker', 'dada v. mukasey', 'heckler v. chaney', 'kucana v. holder', 'mata v. lynch']",[],[],0,0,0,
"An organization, ""Global Solutions Institute,"" seeks an H-1B visa cap exemption as a ""nonprofit research organization."" USCIS denies the petition, interpreting ""primarily engaged in basic research and/or applied research"" to mean ""directly and principally engaged in research,"" and finds Global Solutions Institute's evidence insufficient to meet this standard. Global Solutions Institute challenges this denial under the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing that USCIS misinterpreted its regulation, its decision lacked factual support, and it failed to explain its departure from prior approvals of similar petitions. Based on the provided case, how would a U.S. federal court likely rule on Global Solutions Institute's challenge?","A U.S. federal court would likely rule in favor of USCIS, upholding the denial of the H-1B visa cap exemption. The court in the analogous case found USCIS's interpretation of ""primarily engaged in basic research and/or applied research"" as meaning ""directly and principally engaged in research"" to be unambiguously correct, aligning with dictionary definitions, statutory text, and regulatory history. The court would likely defer to the agency's factual assessment, finding that USCIS's conclusion that the organization failed to meet its evidentiary burden was fair and reasonable, considering the evidence in proportion to its other activities. Finally, regarding prior approvals, the court would likely find that an agency is permitted to change its position, and USCIS adequately explained its decision by acknowledging prior approvals and providing a detailed, reasoned analysis of the current petition based on the record, which is sufficient under the Administrative Procedure Act.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['open society institute v. us citizenship and immigration services', 'natl assn of mfrs. v. dept of lab.', 'van hollen jr. v. fec', 'fogo de chao holdings inc. v. u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'malat v. riddell', 'cayuga nation v. bernhardt', 'am. bioscience inc. v. thompson', 'hill dermaceuticals inc. v. food & drug admin.', 'cts corp. v. epa', 'james madison ltd. by hecht v. ludwig', 'amfac resorts l.l.c. v. u.s. dept of the interior', 'city of dania beach fla. v. faa', 'oceana inc. v. locke', 'kisor v. wilkie', 'auer v. robbins', 'bowles v. seminole rock & sand co.', 'christopher v. smithkline beecham corp.', 'united states v. mead corp.', 'anr pipeline co. v. ferc', 'royal siam corp. v. chertoff', 'nw. immigrant rts. project v. uscis', 'fcc v. fox television stations inc.', 'natl assn of home builders v. epa', 'physicians for soc. resp. v. wheeler', 'motor vehicle mfrs. assn of u.s. inc. v. state farm mut. auto. ins.', 'pub. citizen inc. v. faa']","[{'title': '8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(19)(iii)(C)', 'chunk': '8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(19)(iii)(C) defines a nonprofit research organization as one primarily engaged in basic and/or applied research, requiring direct and principal engagement in research activities.'}]",[],1,0,1,
"A group of international students had their F-1 visas terminated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after discovering they were ""enrolled"" in a sham university created by DHS as part of a sting operation. The termination letter stated their SEVIS record and Form I-20 had been set to ""Terminated due to your fraudulent enrollment."" The students filed a federal lawsuit challenging the termination, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and Due Process, and seeking an order prohibiting the Government from finding they committed fraud. The District Court dismissed the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding the DHS action was not final because reinstatement proceedings were pending and the case was not ripe for review. The students appealed. If these students were to proceed with their appeal, would the appellate court likely find that the DHS's termination of their F-1 visas constitutes a final agency action ripe for judicial review under the APA?","Yes, the appellate court would likely find that DHS's termination of the F-1 visas constitutes a final agency action ripe for judicial review under the APA. The termination order marked the consummation of the agency's decision-making process by stripping the students of their lawful status and placing a fraud notation on their records, thus determining a ""right or obligation.""

The court would disagree with the District Court's conclusions regarding finality and ripeness for two main reasons:
1.  **Finality of Agency Action:**
    *   **Reinstatement Proceedings Are Not a Prerequisite for Review:** There is no statutory or regulatory requirement for students to seek reinstatement after F-1 visa termination. Moreover, reinstatement proceedings do not provide a mechanism to review the propriety of the original termination order or the ""fraudulent enrollment"" decision. Even if reinstatement is granted, it does not ""wipe away"" the prior agency decision.
    *   **Removal Proceedings Are Not a Prerequisite for Review:** The finality of an order cannot be conditioned on potential, uninitiated removal proceedings, which may never occur. Furthermore, neither immigration judges nor the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) have the authority to review the USCIS's discretionary denial of a motion to reinstate student status or to overturn the initial termination decision. Therefore, removal proceedings do not offer an opportunity to contest the agency action. The termination is the culmination, not the initiation, of the agency's decision-making process.
2.  **Ripeness for Review:**
    *   The case is ripe because the parties are in a sufficiently adversarial posture, and the students are genuinely aggrieved by the termination of their lawful status and the permanent ""fraud"" notation on their records. The government's shifting position on whether the students were victims or participants in the fraud further underscores the need for judicial review that would otherwise be absent. Ongoing reinstatement proceedings do not render the case unripe because they do not provide an avenue to review ICE's termination decision.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['jie fang v. dir us immigration & customs enforcement', 'bennett v. spear', 'pinho v. gonzales', 'darby v. cisneros', 'cabaccang v. uscis', 'hosseini v. johnson', 'young dong kim v. holder', 'ghorbani v. ins', 'tooloee v. ins', 'qureshi v. holder', 'kashani v. nelson', 'ftc v. standard oil co. of cal.', 'palakovic v. wetzel', 'marathon petroleum corp. v. secy of finance', 'felmeister v. office of attorney ethics', 'peachlum v. city of york', 'babbitt v. united farm workers natl union']",[],"[{'title': 'Matter of C-Y-Appeal of Immigrant Investor Program Office Decision Form I-526, Immigrant Petition By Alien Entrepreneur', 'chunk': 'Matter of C-Y-Appeal of Immigrant Investor Program Office Decision Form I-526 denied petitioner for failing to document fund transfers.

During the plea, the trial court read the defendant a form advising of potential immigration consequences (deportation, exclusion, denial of naturalization), and the defendant indicated understanding. Subsequently, the defendant filed a post-sentence motion to withdraw the guilty plea, arguing that a limited understanding of English prevented a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary plea, and that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to adequately advise on the immigration consequences of an assault conviction.

The defendant's claim of a language barrier preventing a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary plea lacks merit, as the regularity of the plea hearing (where no interpreter was requested or appointed) is presumed due to the absence of a transcript. Additionally, testimony from the defendant's former counsel and probation officer, along with previous trial testimony given by the defendant without an interpreter, demonstrated a sufficient ability to understand and communicate in English at the time of the plea.

Therefore, counsel was only required to advise the defendant that pleading guilty to assault might carry a risk of adverse immigration consequences. Since counsel's testimony, which the trial court found credible, indicated that she discussed the immigration consequences listed in the plea form with the defendant, her performance was not deficient.

Should the court grant GlobalTech Solutions' motion for permissive intervention under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b)?","No, the court should deny GlobalTech Solutions' motion for permissive intervention. Intervention would be inappropriate because it would result in undue delay and the two companies' cases are factually distinct. USCIS's review of H-1B visa petitions is fact-intensive and courts' review is limited to the administrative record. The two companies' petitions would not share a single piece of evidence in common, and the job positions, while broadly involving computer technology, would have significantly varying specific functional responsibilities (e.g., ""Senior Software Engineer"" versus ""Project Manager IT""). Furthermore, Innovate Systems' case likely involves an additional legal question (proving an employer-employee relationship) not present in GlobalTech's case, which could prove dispositive and adds complexity. Given these distinct factual and legal natures, reviewing separate agency decisions and records would inject unnecessary complexity and delay into the existing case.

"After being convicted of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud and ordered to pay over $200,000 in restitution, an individual is found removable as an aggravated felon. If this individual, while detained and proceeding pro se, files a petition for review of the BIA's order 31 days after it was mailed, can they successfully challenge the use of the restitution amount to establish the aggravated felony, or argue ineffective assistance of counsel in their immigration proceedings?","No, the individual in this situation would likely not successfully challenge the use of the restitution amount to establish the aggravated felony, nor could they argue ineffective assistance of counsel in their immigration proceedings if not properly raised before the BIA.

Firstly, the court would likely have jurisdiction to hear the petition for review, despite it being received 31 days after the BIA order was mailed, because the ""prison mailbox rule"" (Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 25(a)(2)(A)(iii)) applies to pro se detainees in immigration proceedings. This rule deems a filing timely if it is deposited in the institution's internal mail system on or before the last day for filing, with a compliant certificate of service or evidence of deposit.

Secondly, regarding the aggravated felony determination, a restitution order tied to a fraud conspiracy conviction, clearly showing a loss to victims exceeding $10,000, provides clear and convincing evidence to establish that the conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M). The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) is permitted to rely on such sentencing-related material to determine the amount of loss, and the individual's restitution order for $229,717.30 linked to their conviction would be sufficient evidence.

Finally, any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel concerning immigration proceedings cannot be considered by the court if the individual failed to first raise it before the BIA on direct appeal or in a motion to reopen. Failure to exhaust an issue before the BIA is a jurisdictional bar for the appellate court. Additionally, other unreasoned and unsupported claims would likely be considered abandoned.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['osei fosu v. garland', 'singh v. sessions', 'chun v. ins', 'zhu v. gonzales', 'shroff v. sessions', 'ouedraogo v. ins', 'navarro-miranda v. ashcroft', 'stone v. ins', 'goonsuwan v. ashcroft', 'guirguis v. ins', 'smith v. conner', 'adon v. holder', 'chavarria-reyes v. lynch', 'arangoaradondo v. ins', 'barrientos v. lynch', 'arguelles-olivares v. mukasey', 'nijhawan v. holder', 'rodriguez v. barr', 'avelar-oliva v. barr', 'omari v. holder', 'yang v. holder']",[],[],0,0,0,

"A Christian leader from El Salvador, Samuel Argueta-Hernandez, was repeatedly threatened by MS-13 gang members after he refused to pay extortion and collaborate with them, with later threats explicitly mentioning his religious leadership. An assassin attempted to kill his son, and Salvadoran authorities, while acknowledging his danger, told him they could not protect him and even asked him to sign a liability waiver if he remained in the country. If the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denies his applications for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), stating that the harm was not severe enough due to lack of physical injury, that the nexus to his religion was insufficient as the gang's primary motive was extortion, and that the government's temporary safe house and facilitated departure demonstrated a willingness to protect him, how should a U.S. Court of Appeals review this decision?","The U.S. Court of Appeals should grant the petition for review, reverse the BIA's decision, and remand for further proceedings.

It also erred in its nexus analysis by treating motive as an ""either-or"" proposition, failing to consider mixed motives (such as extortion coexisting with religious persecution) and one of the proposed particular social groups (Salvadoran informants against gang members).

The denial of an I-765 application is committed to the discretion of USCIS by law, making it unreviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because there are no judicially manageable standards in the relevant statutes or regulations against which to judge USCIS's exercise of discretion. Furthermore, a request to reverse the denial and approve authorization is a mandatory injunction, which is an extraordinary remedy requiring a clear likelihood of success on the merits, a standard the plaintiff failed to meet. The court also cannot compel agency action (like reopening an I-765) under APA § 706(1) unless it's a discrete, ministerial, and non-discretionary duty, which is not the case for I-765 applications.

The court found that the TRAC factors, used to evaluate the reasonableness of agency delay, favored the defendants. Specifically:
1.  **Rule of Reason:** USCIS's ""visa availability"" and ""first-in, first-out"" processing method is a ""rule of reason"" and ""identifiable rationale"" that prioritizes applicants for whom visas are available, which courts in this District have consistently found reasonable. A three to four-year delay, while significant, falls within the range of what courts have deemed reasonable for immigration petitions in the absence of specific congressional guidance.

"An alien ordered removed in absentia seeks to reopen their removal proceedings, arguing that the immigration court lacked jurisdiction because the Notice to Appear (NTA) was not filed, that the Board of Immigration Appeals improperly relied on a reconstructed record containing a Form I-213 instead of the NTA to prove notice, and that their due process rights were violated due to lack of written notice of the hearing. Should the federal appellate court grant the petition to review and reverse the denial of the motion to reopen?","No, the federal appellate court should deny the petition for review. The court found that the regulation concerning NTA filing (8 C.F.R. § 1003.14(a)) is a claim-processing rule, not jurisdictional, thus rejecting the jurisdictional challenge. The court also affirmed the BIA's reliance on the Form I-213 from the reconstructed record, deeming it an ""inherently trustworthy"" and admissible document that could establish the alien's deportability and that he received notice of his removal hearing, especially since no evidence suggested it was incorrect or obtained by coercion. Furthermore, the court concluded that the alien failed to present compelling evidence sufficient to reverse the BIA's finding that he received notice and an interpreter, thereby not demonstrating that his in absentia removal order should be rescinded for lack of notice under 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(G)(i) and § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii). Finally, the court dismissed the due process claims, stating there is no liberty interest in the discretionary denial of a motion to reopen, and that the alien failed to show substantial prejudice regarding his purported failure to receive notice, as the BIA properly relied on the Form I-213.","[('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['alexandre-matias v. garland', 'orellana-monson v. holder', 'fuentes-pena v. barr', 'hernandez-castillo v. sessions', 'omagah v. ashcroft', 'pierre-paul v. barr', 'niz-chavez v. garland', 'maniar v. garland', 'yohey v. collins', 'bustos-torres v. ins', 'santos-zacaria v. garland', 'wang v. holder', 'ramos-portillo v. barr', 'arteaga-ramirez v. barr', 'okpala v. whitaker']",[],[],0,0,0,
"An immigrant was given a Notice to Appear (NTA) that did not specify the date or time of their removal hearing.

The court concluded that the Petitioner forfeited his right to notice by failing to keep the immigration court apprised of his correct mailing address or to correct the erroneous address. The Petitioner signed forms (the ""Notification Requirement for Change of Address"" and Form I-830) containing the one-letter error in the city name and was obligated to correct it, even if an immigration officer initially caused the error. The court clarified that precedents like *Spagnol-Bastos v. Garland*, *Gudiel-Villatoro v. Garland*, and *Platero-Rosales v.

This forfeiture applies regardless of whether the original Notice to Appear (NTA) included the hearing time and place, making cases like *Rodriguez v.

"An asylum applicant from Cameroon, whose testimony about persecution (arrest, torture, protest involvement) is deemed credible by an Immigration Judge (I.J.), has their application for asylum and withholding of removal denied due to insufficient corroborating evidence. The I.J. finds that affidavits submitted by family and friends lack personal knowledge of the events and that other forms of corroboration (like medical evidence of injuries) were not provided despite being reasonably available. The applicant argues that the I.J. erred by not following the procedures outlined in *Matter of L-A-C-*, which require an I.J. to first identify specific corroborating evidence, then give the applicant an opportunity to explain its absence, and finally state whether that explanation is sufficient. Did the I.J.'s actions in this case violate the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures?","No, the Immigration Judge's actions did not violate the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures in this case. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the petition for review, affirming the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision, which upheld the I.J.'s denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture (CAT) protection.

The Court held that the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures for identifying specific corroborating evidence and allowing an explanation for its absence apply only when the I.J. requires ""specific corroborating evidence"" and holds one missing piece of evidence to be the *sine qua non* to corroboration. In this case, the I.J. did not impose such a requirement. Instead, the I.J. engaged in a comprehensive analysis, finding that while the applicant's testimony was credible, it was not sufficiently corroborated by the evidence provided, and that other supporting documents would have been reasonably available. The I.J. specifically found the affidavits submitted by the applicant's wife, uncle, neighbor, and family lawyer insufficient because the affiants lacked personal knowledge of the recounted events. Other evidence, such as the applicant's injured foot and general country reports or newspaper articles, was deemed insufficient to compel a conclusion contrary to the I.J.'s finding of insufficient corroboration. The CAT claim was also denied for the same reason—lack of sufficient corroborating evidence.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['mohndamenang v. garland', 'wang v. holder', 'mikhael v. ins', 'orellana-monson v. holder', 'singh v. gonzales', 'negusie v. holder', 'ins v. aguirre-aguirre', 'yang v. holder', 'avelar-oliva v. barr', 'chen v. gonzales', 'sharma v. holder', 'arkansas v. oklahoma', 'ins v. elias-zacarias']",[],[],0,0,0,

For the claims over which it had jurisdiction, the court denied them:
1.  **Substantive Claims (Asylum, Withholding of Removal, CAT, BIA's factual conclusions, and denial of motion to remand):** These claims were denied because the BIA's factual findings and conclusions were supported by substantial evidence; the evidence did not compel a contrary conclusion that the harm endured amounted to persecution or torture, that the BJP was the Indian government, that the national identification system prevented relocation, or that the medical evaluation supported his claims of BJP attacks. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to remand because the new evidence would not have changed the outcome.
2.  **Due Process Claims:** These claims were denied because Kumar failed to show substantial prejudice, as the alleged errors (discrepancy in the record, failure to advise on medical evaluation/declaration, and denial of continuance) would not have affected the outcome of the proceedings.
3.  **Meaningful Consideration Claims:** These claims were denied because the BIA's decision sufficiently reflected a meaningful consideration of the relevant evidence, referencing the testimony and affidavits Kumar alleged were mischaracterized.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['kumar v. garland', 'mireles-valdez v. ashcroft', 'chun v. ins', 'ins v. elias-zacarias', 'chen v. gonzales', 'goonsuwan v. ashcroft', 'omari v. holder', 'martinez-guevara v. garland', 'avelar-oliva v. barr', 'dale v. holder', 'eduard v. ashcroft', 'abdel-masieh v. ins', 'qorane v. barr', 'morales v. sessions', 'munoz-granados v. barr', 'efe v. ashcroft', 'gjetani v. barr', 'tesfamichael v. gonzales', 'orellana-monson v. holder', 'roy v. ashcroft', 'martinez-lopez v. barr', 'mikhael v. ins', 'singh v. whitaker', 'khadiwal v. lynch', 'santos-alvarado v. barr', 'okpala v. whitaker', 'ogunfuye v. holder', 'cabrera v. sessions', 'wang v. ashcroft', 'cardona-franco v. garland', 'ramchandani v. gonzales', 'suate-orellana v. barr']",[],[],0,0,0,

"A non-profit organization, ""Immigrant Rights Advocates,"" provides pro bono legal services to low-income immigrants. The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) recently finalized a rule significantly increasing fees for various immigration filings, including appeals to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and applications for cancellation of removal. Immigrant Rights Advocates argues that these increased fees will severely limit their ability to provide legal representation, forcing them to take on fewer clients and divert resources to fee waiver applications. They believe EOIR failed to adequately consider these impacts during the rulemaking process. Can Immigrant Rights Advocates successfully challenge the legality of these fee increases, particularly for appeals and cancellation of removal applications, under the Administrative Procedure Act?","Yes, Immigrant Rights Advocates can likely successfully challenge the legality of these specific fee increases under the Administrative Procedure Act.

EOIR was obligated to address these concerns as part of the notice-and-comment process but failed to do so.

"An individual who has been a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for over five years, but whose initial admission to the U.S. as an ""accompanying"" relative was procedurally flawed because they arrived before the principal immigrant, applies for naturalization. Can this individual be denied naturalization on the grounds that they were not ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence,"" even if the government's window for rescinding their LPR status has closed and there was no fraud or misrepresentation on the applicant's part?","Yes, the individual can be denied naturalization. An applicant for naturalization must establish that they have been ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence."" ""Lawfully admitted"" requires compliance with substantive legal requirements, not just procedural regularity. Therefore, an alien who obtains LPR status due to a government mistake, even without fraud, is not lawfully admitted if they were not substantively entitled to that status. In this situation, entering the U.S. before the principal immigrant violates the ""accompanying"" relative requirement of 22 C.F.R. § 40.1(a)(2), which is consistent with the plain language of 8 U.S.C. § 1153(d). The fact that the five-year statute of limitations for rescinding LPR status has run does not mean the initial entry was lawful or that the individual is eligible for naturalization; it only prevents the government from instituting rescission proceedings.

Claims regarding eligibility for hardship waivers or the ability to ""stack"" waivers were not addressed by the Board of Immigration Appeals and, therefore, the court lacked jurisdiction to review them, finding no realistic possibility that a remand would lead to a different conclusion given the unappealable ground for removability.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['reese v. garland', 'rodriguez-avalos v. holder', 'dhuka v. holder', 'siwe v. holder', 'garcia-carias v. holder', 'chevron u.s.a. inc. v. nat. res. def. council inc.', 'vasquez v. holder', 'i.n.s. v. errico', 'tima v. atty gen.', 'fayzullina v. holder', 'gourche v. holder', 'herrera gonzalez v. rosen', 'taggar v. holder', 'koons buick pontiac gmc inc. v. nigh', 'judulang v. holder', 'animashaun v. i.n.s.', 'reno v. flores', 'miranda-lores v. i.n.s.', 'anwar v. i.n.s.', 'united states v. batchelder', 'castillo-rodriguez v. i.n.s.', 'singh v. sessions', 'efe v. ashcroft', 'lopez-perez v. garland', 'luna-garcia v. barr']","[{'title': 'U.S. Code Title 8 Section 1227', 'chunk': '(B) major sources of precursor chemicals used in the production of illicit narcotics; or'}, {'title': 'U.S. Code Title 8 Section 1184', 'chunk': '(5) if a government-owned entity in such country engages in the broadcast of copyrighted material, including films or television material, belonging to United States copyright owners without their express consent or such country fails to work towards the provision of adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights;'}, {'title': 'U.S. Code Title 8 Section 1182', 'chunk': '(viii) addressing childhood obesity through in-school and after-school physical activities, and providing nutrition education to students, in elementary schools and secondary schools; or'}, {'title': 'U.S. Code Title 8 Section 1153', 'chunk': 'The definitions in the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.] apply in the administration of this section.\n\n**Definitions:**\n*   ""Employment-based visa"" means an immigrant visa issued pursuant to the numerical limitation under section 203(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1153(b)].\n*   ""Executive capacity"" has the meaning given in section 101(a)(44)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(44)(B)], as added by section 123 of Pub.

"A public interest organization submits a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to a federal agency, seeking all complaint records filed against its administrative judges. The agency responds by disclosing thousands of pages of documents, but with two types of redactions: (1) all administrative judges' names are redacted, with the agency arguing a blanket privacy interest under FOIA Exemption 6, and (2) discrete sentences or paragraphs within otherwise responsive complaint records are redacted, with the agency asserting that this information is ""non-responsive"" to the request, even if it does not fall under any FOIA exemption. The organization challenges both categories of redactions in court. How should a court rule on these challenges based on the provided case?","Based on the case ruling, the court should rule as follows:
1.  **Redaction of judges' names under Exemption 6:** The agency's categorical, across-the-board redaction of all administrative judges' names would likely be deemed inadequately justified. FOIA Exemption 6 does not categorically exempt individuals' identities, as the privacy and public interests at stake can vary depending on factors such as whether the judge is sitting or retired, the seriousness and number of complaints, and the potential for public understanding of government operations through disclosure. A more individualized inquiry, or a particularized showing for defined subgroups of judges, is required to properly balance the privacy interests against the public interest in disclosure.
2.  **Redaction of non-responsive information within responsive records:** The court should find no statutory basis for redacting ostensibly non-responsive information from a record once that record has been deemed responsive to a FOIA request. Under the statutory framework, once an agency identifies a record as responsive, the sole basis for withholding information within that record is if the information falls within one of FOIA's nine statutory exemptions. Redacting non-exempt information on the basis of non-responsiveness within an otherwise responsive record is not permitted by the statute.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['american immigration lawyers assn v. executive office for immigration review', 'milner v. dept of navy', 'citizens for responsibility & ethics in wash. v. u.s. dept of justice crew i', 'assassination archives & research ctr. v. cia', 'vaughn v. rosen', 'larson v. dept of state', 'multi ag media llc v. dept of agric.', 'u.s. dept of justice v. reporters comm. for freedom of press', 'natl assn of home builders v. norton', 'schrecker v. u.s. dept of justice', 'judicial watch inc. v. food & drug admin.', 'armstrong v. exec. office of the president', 'gallant v. nlrb', 'united states v. landano', 'prison legal news v. samuels', 'skelton v. united states postal service', 'common cause v. irs', 'nlrb v. sears roebuck & co.', 'leeds v. commr of patents & trademarks', 'vietnam veterans of amer. v. dept of navy', 'am. immigration lawyers assn v. exec. office for immigration review']",[],[],0,0,0,
"A U.S. company, ""InnovateTech Inc."", seeks to extend an H-1B visa for its foreign citizen employee, who works as a ""Lead Software Architect"" at a client site through a subcontracting arrangement. USCIS denies the extension, citing (1) a lack of sufficiently detailed, non-speculative day-to-day work assignments for the entire visa period, (2) perceived inconsistencies in the minimum degree requirements stated across different application documents (e.g., ""bachelor's degree in a computer-related field"" vs. ""bachelor's or higher degree in Information Technology or Computer Science""), and (3) insufficient evidence to prove InnovateTech has ""actual control"" over the employee's specific tasks at the client site, despite InnovateTech providing documentation confirming its exclusive right to hire, pay, fire, and supervise the employee. InnovateTech had also referenced the Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook to argue that a ""Lead Software Architect"" position typically requires a bachelor's degree in a specific specialty, but USCIS did not address this argument in its denial. Can InnovateTech successfully challenge this denial under the Administrative Procedure Act?","Yes, InnovateTech can likely successfully challenge the denial. Based on the provided court ruling, USCIS's denial would be considered arbitrary and capricious for several reasons. First, requiring detailed evidence of non-speculative day-to-day work assignments for the entire visa duration and focusing a ""searching inquiry into the specific services"" goes against established legal precedent regarding the ""specialty occupation"" requirement. Second, USCIS's failure to meaningfully consider or even mention InnovateTech's argument that the position is akin to an occupation described in the Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook, which could satisfy the specialty occupation criteria, renders the decision arbitrary and capricious. Third, USCIS's demand for evidence of ""actual control"" over the employee's work and duties beyond the ability to hire, pay, or fire, when InnovateTech has provided evidence of the legal right to control these factors, is inconsistent with regulatory language that states these factors are independently sufficient to establish an employer-employee relationship. The court would likely grant InnovateTech's motion for summary judgment and remand the case for reconsideration consistent with these principles.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['stellar it solutions inc v. united states citizenship and immigration services', 'stellar it sols. inc. v. u.s. citizenship and immigration servs.', 'itserve all. inc. v. cissna', 'ctr. for food safety v. salazar', 'ardmore consulting grp. inc. v. contreras-sweet', 'kaiser found. hosps. v. sebelius', 'motor vehicle mfrs. assn of u.s. inc. v. state farm mut. auto. ins.', 'agape church inc. v. fcc', 'recording indus. assn of am. inc. v. librarian of congress', 'at&t inc. v. fcc', 'auer v. robbins', 'taylor made software inc. v. cuccinelli', 'innova sols. inc. v. baran', 'bnsf ry. co. v. surface transp. bd.', 'pam squared at texarkana llc v. azar']",[],[],0,0,0,

"An individual, native and citizen of Mexico, is ordered removed from the U.S. after being convicted in Texas of aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon. The individual argues that this conviction does not qualify as an ""aggravated felony"" under federal immigration law, and thus he is not removable. He also challenges the denial of his motion for continuance, claiming the immigration judge abused discretion by finding he lacked ""good cause."" Based on U.S. federal court precedent, should the petition for review challenging the removability finding and the denial of continuance be granted?","No, the petition for review should be denied. Aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon under Texas law is considered a crime of violence and, therefore, an aggravated felony for purposes of federal immigration law because it requires the intentional or knowing use or attempted use of physical force with a deadly weapon. The Texas offense requires the use or exhibition of a deadly weapon in a manner that facilitates the associated felony, satisfying the federal definition of a crime of violence. Consequently, an individual convicted of this offense is removable. Furthermore, the denial of a motion for continuance is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and immigration judges may consider a wide range of factors, including criminal history, in determining ""good cause.""

"An immigrant invested $500,000 in an American business, believing it would qualify them for an EB-5 immigrant investor visa.

USCIS then issued a decision explicitly stating the visa petition was ""denied,"" not ""revoked."" The immigrant, through new counsel, filed a motion to reopen or reconsider (MTR), citing ineffective assistance of prior counsel and a new interpretation of the loan documents. USCIS denied the MTR. If the immigrant seeks judicial review in federal court, challenging both the ""denial"" of the visa petition and the denial of the MTR, will the federal court have subject matter jurisdiction, and what must the immigrant specifically allege to adequately state a claim regarding the denial of the MTR?","Yes, the federal court will have subject matter jurisdiction. The court will treat the initial USCIS decision as a ""denial"" of a visa petition, which is subject to judicial review, rather than an unreviewable ""revocation,"" especially when the agency's decision documents explicitly characterize it as a denial. The court will also have jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider. However, to adequately state a claim challenging the denial of a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the immigrant must allege that specific procedural requirements were met: (1) providing an affidavit describing the agreement with counsel in detail; (2) informing counsel of the allegations and affording counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3) reporting whether a complaint of ethical or legal violations has been filed, and if not, why. For a motion to reconsider, the immigrant must establish that the decision was based on an incorrect application of law or Service policy, supported by pertinent precedent decisions, and not merely raise new factual interpretations of documents.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['wang v. united states citizenship and immigration services', 'moms against mercury v. fda', 'georgiades v. martin-trigona', 'herbert v. natl acad. of scis.', 'nat. res. def. council inc. v. sec', 'mohammad v. napolitano', 'wilderness soc. v. norton', 'jicarilla apache nation v. united states department of the interior', 'sea b mining company v. addison', 'burlington truck lines inc. v. united states', 'sec v. chenery corp.', 'mata v. lynch', 'bell atl. corp. v. twombly', 'ashcroft v. iqbal', 'delgado v. quarantillo', 'grewal v. uscis', 'strong v. ins']",[],"[{'title': 'Matter of C-Y-Appeal of Immigrant Investor Program Office Decision Form I-526, Immigrant Petition By Alien Entrepreneur', 'chunk': 'Matter of C-Y-Appeal of Immigrant Investor Program Office Decision Form I-526 denied petitioner for failing to document fund transfers.

"A regional center, originally designated in 2010 under the prior EB-5 regional-center statute, maintains ongoing investments with 23 investors whose petitions are pending. However, it has not sponsored any new investment projects or investors since the passage of the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022. The regional center challenges the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' (USCIS) imposition of the annual EB-5 Integrity Fund Fee, arguing that it was not ""designated under subparagraph (E)"" of the new Act and that applying the fee retroactively would be unlawful. Must this regional center pay the annual Integrity Fund Fee?","Yes, the regional center must pay the annual Integrity Fund Fee. The court held that the phrase ""designated under subparagraph (E)"" applies to all currently designated regional centers, regardless of when their designation initially began. The word ""designated"" in the statute refers to an ongoing status rather than a one-time past event. The court reasoned that the Act's overall framework, the usage of ""designate"" versus ""establish,"" and the Act's purpose (to combat fraud that arose from pre-Act regional centers) support this broad interpretation.

"My client was lawfully present in the U.S. on an H1B visa but was convicted of conspiracy to commit money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h), involving over $10,000. He fears he will be found removable as an aggravated felon and wants to know if there are any grounds to challenge this or seek a waiver of inadmissibility, especially considering his claim that his conviction did not require proof of an overt act. He also believes his removal proceedings were flawed due to a defective notice to appear and missing hearing transcripts. What does the law say about his situation, particularly regarding the definition of an aggravated felony and his eligibility for relief?","The court denied the petition for review in part and dismissed it in part. The court affirmed that a conviction for conspiracy to commit money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) involving funds exceeding $10,000 plainly constitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(D), making the individual removable. It was deemed unnecessary to address whether such a conviction also qualified under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(U) or required proof of an overt act.
Regarding the claim for a waiver of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), the court dismissed this petition for lack of jurisdiction because the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not raising the ""overt act"" argument concerning inadmissibility before the BIA. Additionally, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(I)(ii), which covers knowing conspirators in money laundering offenses, is not among the provisions for which waivers are available under § 1182(h).
The due process challenge concerning allegedly missing hearing transcripts was denied because the petitioner failed to demonstrate any substantial prejudice. Lastly, the argument that the immigration authorities lacked jurisdiction due to a defective notice to appear, based on *Pereira v.

"Can a foreign investor compel U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to expedite the processing of their Form I-526 application for an EB-5 immigrant visa, alleging an unreasonable 30-month delay that has led to mental and physical health issues, when USCIS follows a visa availability approach and Congress has not set a binding timeline for such adjudications?","No, a foreign investor cannot compel USCIS to expedite processing under these circumstances. The court found that USCIS had not unreasonably delayed in adjudicating the Form I-526 application.

The effective 30-month delay was not considered unreasonable compared to similar cases.

"Is sexual solicitation of a minor, in violation of section 3-324(b) of the Maryland Criminal Law, categorically a crime involving moral turpitude, and how does this affect an alien's eligibility for cancellation of removal, particularly concerning the mental state required regarding the victim's age?","Sexual solicitation of a minor in violation of section 3-324(b) of the Maryland Criminal Law with the intent to engage in an unlawful sexual offense under section 3-307 is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude, even when the statute requires no culpable mental state as to the age of the child. The Board of Immigration Appeals reaffirmed this position, clarifying that a sexual offense targeting very young victims (under 14, or under 16 with a significant age differential) is a CIMT due to inherent antisocial and depraved nature, regardless of a mistake of age defense. However, in light of the Fourth Circuit's view that the Board's prior decision represented a change in position, this holding will be applied prospectively in the Fourth Circuit.

"Under U.S. federal immigration law, can a former government employee of a foreign country's prison system, who received military training and monitored inmates, establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal based on a fear of persecution from criminal gangs, if the perceived threat stems from the nature of their former employment rather than an immutable characteristic, a protected social group, or a statutorily recognized political opinion?","The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied the petition for review, affirming the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision that the petitioner, a former employee of El Salvador's Ministry of Justice, was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal. The court concluded that substantial evidence supported the BIA's finding that the petitioner failed to show the requisite nexus between the harm she feared and suffered and a protected statutory ground. The court agreed that her role, which included monitoring prisoners via video, receiving military training, wearing a uniform and mask, and being identified by gangs due to her employment, meant the dangers she faced arose from the nature of her employment and domestic unrest, not from a protected ground, consistent with *Matter of Fuentes*. Furthermore, the court rejected her argument of an imputed anti-gang political opinion, noting that ""pro rule-of-law, anti-corruption, and anti-gang"" is not a recognized political opinion for asylum and that criminally-motivated actions (such as gangs seeking to exploit her work-related access and knowledge) do not constitute persecution on account of a protected ground.

Binding precedent in the D.C.

In this case, the requests sought ""all records sent or received electronically"" by three high-ranking officials over a nine-month period, yielding over 1.6 million pages and an estimated processing time of over two years and nine months (8,151 hours). The Court found this burden too high, particularly because the requests were not tailored to specific policy concerns, thus requiring the agency to process thousands of documents with no conceivable relation to the requester's stated interest (e.g., workplace emails about miscellaneous topics or health care plans). The Court also noted the risk of severe interference with the agency's IT systems due to the large data transfer.

"A manufacturing company, facing numerous charges for failing to verify employee work authorization and knowingly continuing to employ unauthorized aliens, seeks to overturn an administrative law judge's decision. The company argues that it acted in good faith by hiring a purportedly qualified HR director whose negligence led to the violations. It also claims that many violations are barred by the five-year statute of limitations. Furthermore, the company challenges the summarily imposed civil penalties, arguing that its severe financial distress (including significant net losses and pending bankruptcy) constitutes a material factual dispute regarding its ability to pay, which should have precluded summary determination of the penalty amount. How would a federal court likely rule on each of these arguments?","A federal court would likely rule as follows:
1.  **Good Faith Defense:** The court would likely reject the good faith defenses. The defense under 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(a)(3) applies only to knowing *hiring* violations, not *continuing employment* or *paperwork* violations. The defense under 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(6) is limited to *technical or procedural* failures, not substantive ones, and the HR director's failure to perform their duties would be properly imputed to the company as its agent.
2.  **Statute of Limitations (General):** The court would likely reject a generalized statute of limitations defense for most violations if it was not properly asserted with a statement of facts as required by 28 C.F.R. § 68.9(c). For paperwork violations, the five-year limitations period is measured from when the company was no longer required to retain the I-9 form (three years after hire or one year after termination, whichever is later). For continuing employment violations, it is measured from the last day of the ineligible alien's employment.
3.  **Statute of Limitations (Specific Untimely Claim):** However, the court would likely grant the petition for review as to a specific violation if the claim accrued more than five years before the administrative action was commenced (e.g., employment ended before the five-year window) and the agency itself had conceded the untimeliness. The limitations period begins when the claim first accrued, not when the penalty is administratively imposed.
4.  **Summary Determination of Penalty:** The court would likely uphold the summary determination of the penalty. While ""ability to pay"" is a factor that an ALJ may consider at their discretion, it is not one of the five mandatory factors listed in 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(e)(5). Because it is within the ALJ's power to decline to consider this factor at all, the company's ability to pay is not considered a *material* issue of fact that would preclude summary determination of the penalty amount. The ALJ's decision to proceed despite ambiguities in financial evidence would be considered an implicit choice to give that factor no weight, and this does not warrant reversal. The court would also typically uphold the ALJ's consideration of the statutory factors (size of business, good faith, seriousness of violations, whether the employee is an unauthorized alien, and history of previous violations) if the penalty falls within the prescribed monetary range and is reasonably based on the evidence presented.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['dls precision fab llc v. us immigration & customs enforcement', 'ketchikan drywall servs. inc. v. immigration & customs enft', 'united states v. curran engg co.', 'sec v. mohn', 'united states v.', 'united states v. meyer', 'united states v. deleon valenzuela', 'federal election commission v. williams', 'cts corp. v. waldburger', 'order of r.r. telegraphers v. ry. express agency inc.', 'united states v. primera enters. inc.', 'united states v. m.t.s. serv. corp.', 'united states. v. snack attack deli inc.', 'united states v. romans racing stables inc.', 'united states v. dominguez', 'bosma v. u.s. dept of agric.', 'getahun v. o.c.a.h.o.', 'anderson v. liberty lobby inc.']",[],[],0,0,0,

These claims require the expansion of *Bivens* remedies to a new context, which is a ""disfavored judicial activity."" ""Special factors counseling hesitation"" preclude such expansion, including that *Bivens* suits are not the appropriate mechanism to challenge general government policies, alternative methods of relief (such as class actions or official capacity suits for injunctions) are available, and the claims challenge powers subject to extensive Congressional action, particularly in immigration matters.

Claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against federal agencies and officials in their official capacities would be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to mootness. Such claims become moot when the plaintiff has been reunited with their child, has passed a credible fear interview, has been released from detention, and the challenged policy has been changed by Executive Order and enjoined nationwide by a separate class action lawsuit.

They filed a class action lawsuit challenging this termination under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging due process violations, and seeking an order preventing the government from deeming their enrollment fraudulent. The District Court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that the termination was not a final agency action and the case was not ripe for review because reinstatement proceedings were pending or removal proceedings could provide administrative relief. Are the students' claims for judicial review of the F-1 visa termination a final agency action and ripe for review, despite the availability of reinstatement applications or the potential for future removal proceedings?","Yes, the students' claims for judicial review of the F-1 visa termination are a final agency action and ripe for review. The termination of their F-1 visas constituted a final agency action because there is no statutory or regulatory requirement that a student seek reinstatement, and reinstatement proceedings do not provide a mechanism to review the original termination order or the propriety of the ""fraudulent enrollment"" decision. Unlike asylum terminations, the F-1 termination was the culmination, not the initiation, of the agency's decision-making process. Furthermore, the students are not required to wait for removal proceedings to be instituted, as such proceedings may never occur, and immigration judges and the Board of Immigration Appeals lack the authority to review USCIS's discretionary denial of reinstatement. The case is also ripe for review because the parties are in a sufficiently adversarial posture, the students are genuinely aggrieved by the termination of their lawful status and the notation of fraud on their records, and the government's inconsistent position on the students' culpability underscores the need for judicial review that would otherwise be unavailable.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['jie fang v. dir us immigration & customs enforcement', 'palakovic v. wetzel', 'marathon petroleum corp. v. secy of finance', 'bennett v. spear', 'pinho v. gonzales', 'darby v. cisneros', 'cabaccang v. uscis', 'hosseini v. johnson', 'ftc v. standard oil co. of cal.', 'qureshi v. holder', 'kashani v. nelson', 'young dong kim v. holder', 'ghorbani v. ins', 'tooloee v. ins', 'felmeister v. office of attorney ethics', 'peachlum v. city of york', 'babbitt v. united farm workers natl union']",[],[],0,0,0,

These alternatives could offer the monetary relief (a refund) that the plaintiff sought and allow for review of the challenged agency action to the same extent as an APA case.

Applying the TRAC factors, the court noted that Congress sets no statutory deadline for visa processing, the prejudice alleged was primarily financial rather than health-related, and expediting the applicant's case would merely reorder the queue without net gain.

    *   **Plaintiff's Choice of Forum:** The deference given to the plaintiff's choice of forum is significantly reduced when it is not the plaintiff's home forum and lacks meaningful ties to the controversy. If the administrative decision being challenged was made in another district, the D.C. court will give ""nadir"" deference to the plaintiff's choice to sue in D.C.
    *   **Defendant's Choice of Forum:** This choice gains some deference, especially when the defendants seek transfer to the plaintiff's home forum or where the claim arose.
    *   **Where the Claim Arose:** This is a predominant factor. In Administrative Procedure Act (APA) cases challenging agency action, the claim generally arises where the decision-making process occurred. If the visa petition was processed, adjudicated, and denied by a USCIS service center in another district (e.g., Nebraska), then the claim arose in that district, not D.C., even if general agency policies were formulated in D.C., unless there are credible allegations of direct, case-specific involvement by D.C.-based officials.
    *   **Convenience of Parties, Witnesses, and Access to Proof:** Convenience factors typically favor the district where the plaintiff resides (if applicable) or, more strongly, the district where the administrative record is located and where the agency personnel involved in the challenged decision reside, as APA cases are generally resolved on the administrative record.
3.  **Balancing of Public Interest Factors:**
    *   **Familiarity with Governing Laws:** This factor is neutral for federal law cases as all federal courts are presumed equally familiar.
    *   **Relative Congestion of Calendars:** While current statistics might slightly favor D.C. in terms of caseload, this factor is often a ""wash"" due to the difficulty of accurate assessment and the concern about future congestion if D.C. retains cases with little connection to the district.
    *   **Local Interest in Resolving the Controversy:** This is the ""most important"" public factor. The district where the challenged decision was made (e.g., Nebraska Service Center) has the strongest local interest, especially if the relief sought involves compelling specific actions in that district. A case challenging a single visa petition's denial is typically not considered one of ""national significance.""

In sum, the court will transfer the case to the district where the administrative decision was made and where the bulk of the administrative record and relevant agency personnel are located, finding it to be the optimal venue when D.C. lacks meaningful ties to the specific controversy.","[('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['melnattur v. united states citizenship and immigration services', 'ngonga v. sessions', 'stewart org. inc. v. ricoh corp.', 'aracely v. nielsen', 'gyau v. sessions', 'pengbo li v. miller no.', 'ike v. uscis', 'efficientip inc. v. cuccinelli no.', 'wolfram alpha llc v. cuccinelli', 'united states v.', 'bahena v. renaud', 'pasem v. uscis', 'aishat v. u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'bourdon v. u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'lamont v. haig', 'aftab v. gonzalez', 'norton v. s. utah wilderness all.', 'fed. hous. fin. agency v. first tenn. bank natl assn', 'cameron v. thornburgh', 'stewart v. azar', 'greater yellowstone coal. v. bosworth', 'trout unlimited v. u.s. dept of agric.', 'huskey v. quinlan', 'abusadeh v. chertoff no.']",[],[],0,0,0,
"Apex Construction Inc. hired several new employees. For some, the employees signed Section 1 of the I-9 Form but failed to check the box indicating their specific work authorization status (e.g., U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident). For others, Apex completed Section 2 but failed to list the issuing authority for a driver's license presented as proof of identity. Apex had photocopied all identity and work authorization documents and kept them in a separate folder, believing that the copies, combined with the employee's signature, fulfilled its obligations. During an ICE inspection, these issues were flagged. Apex later produced the copied documents during the administrative hearing, arguing they cured the I-9 deficiencies and showed good faith. Apex now faces civil penalties. Based on the *Ketchikan Drywall Services* decision, how should a court evaluate Apex Construction Inc.'s arguments regarding its I-9 compliance, the nature of its violations, and the potential for penalty mitigation?","Based on the *Ketchikan Drywall Services* decision, Apex Construction Inc.'s arguments would likely be rejected, and the penalties upheld. The court would find that employers must fully complete I-9 Forms, and merely copying and retaining verification documents is neither necessary nor sufficient for compliance, nor does it relieve the employer of the requirement to fully complete Section 2. The regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 274a.2(b)(3), clarifies that copying and retention do not relieve the employer from fully completing Section 2, superseding any prior interpretations to the contrary.

Regarding the specific violations:
1.  **Failure to check a specific box in Section 1:** This is considered a ""substantive"" verification failure under the Virtue Memorandum (which the court grants Skidmore deference). Employees are required to attest to a specific category of eligibility, and failure to check the appropriate box means the statutory requirement (8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(2)) is unfulfilled, regardless of whether other documentation might allow ICE to deduce the employee's status. Employers are responsible for ensuring Section 1 is completely filled out by employees.
2.  **Failure to list the issuing authority for a List B document (e.g., driver's license) in Section 2:** This is a substantive failure. Employers have an obligation to fill out Section 2 of their I-9 Forms ""fully,"" and the absence of the issuing authority constitutes a failure to identify the document utilized, even if ICE might deduce the information from other details.

The court would likely find that the late production of copied documents during the administrative hearing cannot cure substantive deficiencies. The Virtue Memorandum only excuses certain substantive deficiencies where the missing information is found ""on a legible copy of a document retained *with* the Form I-9 and *presented at the I-9 inspection*."" Documents not presented at the initial I-9 inspection do not qualify. The penalties are imposed for substantive deficiencies on the I-9 Forms themselves, not for the manner or timing of document storage or production.

Finally, concerning penalty mitigation, the ALJ has broad discretion. A refusal to mitigate for ""good faith"" would be permissible if, for example, Apex had a history of non-compliance or demonstrated a lack of timely effort to ascertain and conform to the law. Similarly, a refusal to mitigate for ""non-seriousness"" would be upheld, as the penalties are for substantive deficiencies in the I-9 Forms.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['ketchikan drywall services inc v. immigration & customs enforcement', 'judulang v. holder', 'united states v. mead corp.', 'skidmore v. swift & co.', 'balice v. u.s. dept of agric.', 'bosma v. u.s. dept of agric.', 'united states v. manos & assocs. inc.', 'united states v. j.j.l.c. inc. ta richfield caterers', 'montero-martinez v. ashcroft', 'christensen v. harris county', 'united states v. wsc plumbing inc.', 'united states v. carter', 'united states v. candlelight inn', 'united states v. pegasus rest. inc.', 'eeoc v. first citizens bank of billings']",[],"[{'title': 'Matter of C-Y-Appeal of Immigrant Investor Program Office Decision Form I-526, Immigrant Petition By Alien Entrepreneur', 'chunk': 'Matter of C-Y-Appeal of Immigrant Investor Program Office Decision Form I-526 denied petitioner for failing to document fund transfers.

"A nurse from a war-torn region claims asylum, alleging past persecution based on an imputed political opinion (assisting separatists) and Anglophone ethnicity, supported by credible testimony of repeated arrests, beatings, credible death threats, and the disappearance of fellow detainees. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denies relief, finding no past persecution because the injuries were not ""extreme,"" no nexus to a protected ground (as the military targeted him due to his occupation as a nurse, not political opinion), and insufficient corroborating evidence (lack of photos/medical records) despite the nurse's explanation for their absence and submission of affidavits.

"An individual has legally resided in the U.S. for years, is married to an H-1B visa holder with a pending green card application, and has her H-4 nonimmigrant status and Employment Authorization Document (EAD) renewal applications pending with USCIS.

Based on the *TRAC* factors for unreasonable delay, is she likely to succeed on the merits of her claim and thus be granted a preliminary injunction?","No, the individual is not likely to succeed on the merits of her claim and thus will not be granted a preliminary injunction. The court found that USCIS's delay in adjudicating her applications was not sufficiently unreasonable *at present*. Applying the *TRAC* factors:
1.  **Rule of Reason:** USCIS's ""first-in, first-out"" processing system was considered a rule of reason, favoring defendants.
2.  **Congressional Timetable:** While 8 U.S.C. § 1571(b) suggests processing within 180 days (six months), the plaintiff's applications had been pending for less than four months when the decision was made, so this factor favored defendants *for the moment*.
3.  **Human Health and Welfare / Interests Prejudiced:** These factors favored the plaintiff, acknowledging the significant hardship beyond mere economic harm, including loss of employment, inability to drive, and potential impact on her new restaurant's employees, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
4.  **Effect on Competing Priorities:** This factor favored defendants. Granting relief would place the plaintiff ahead of other similarly situated applicants facing delays due to USCIS backlogs in biometrics scheduling, merely reordering the queue without addressing the systemic issue.
Considering these factors as a whole, the court concluded that the rule of reason, the fact that the six-month congressional window had not yet elapsed, and the concern about reordering the queue outweighed the substantial hardships to the plaintiff, meaning the delay was not yet ""so egregious as to warrant mandamus"" or APA relief.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['nibber v. united states citizenship and immigration services', 'sherley v. sebelius', 'univ. of tex. v. camenisch', 'winter v. nat. res. def. council inc.', 'league of women voters of u.s. v. newby', 'pursuing am.s greatness v. fec', 'aamer v. obama', 'munaf v. geren', 'gonzales v. o centro espirita beneficente união do vegetal', 'mazurek v. armstrong', 'archdiocese of wash. v. wash. metro. area. transit auth.', 'davis v. pension benefit guar. corp.', 'singh v. carter', 'norton v. s. utah wilderness all.', 'am. hosp. assn v. burwell', 'uranga v. u.s. citizenship & immigr. servs.', 'gonzales v. cissna', 'a.c.c.s. v. nielsen', 'muvvala v. wolf', 'natl assn of mfrs. v. sec', 'emergency coal. to defend educ. travel v. dept of treasury', 'ray v. cuccinelli', 'khan v. johnson', 'islam v. heinauer', 'konchitsky v. chertoff', 'mashpee wampanoag tribal council inc. v. norton', 'liberty fund inc. v. chao']",[],[],0,0,0,

"If a Mexican citizen, who publicly campaigned against the Mexican Navy following the disappearance of her son, had her vacant home ransacked and observed Navy vehicles drive by her house once, but experienced no direct threats or further incidents, would she and her minor children be entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention Against Torture in the U.S. based on past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution?","No, the petitioners would not be entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention Against Torture.
The court denied the petition for review, affirming the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision.

1.  **Asylum:**
    *   **Past Persecution:** The BIA did not err in finding no past persecution. The ransacking of the vacant home was a singular event that did not cause serious or permanent damage and was more akin to ""abusive or harassing treatment"" than ""extreme conduct"" required for persecution. The incidents (ransacking and Navy vehicles driving by) did not create a threat sufficiently menacing or imminent to amount to persecution. Rangel had publicly campaigned against the Navy for four months without physical harm or direct threats, and the alleged threat lacked the ""organized, relentless campaign of intimidation"" found in cases compelling a finding of persecution.
    *   **Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution:** The BIA did not err. Petitioners failed to establish past persecution, thus were not entitled to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear. Rangel had publicly campaigned against the Navy for four months without suffering physical harm, threats, or reprisals until the ransacking, and no further threats took place after that incident. There was no indication the Navy remained interested in or actively searching for petitioners, and the disappearance of Rangel's other son was determined to be unrelated to her campaigning.

2.  **Withholding of Removal:** The BIA did not err. Withholding of removal is a higher standard than asylum. Since petitioners failed to demonstrate they suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution for asylum, they necessarily failed to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.

3.  **Convention Against Torture (CAT) Relief:** The BIA did not err. Torture is a higher bar than persecution. Since the basis for relief advanced by petitioners did not even rise to the level of persecution, it follows a fortiori that it does not constitute torture. Additionally, the minor children's claims, based entirely on Rangel's experiences, independently failed as they would not be personally at risk of torture.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['loredo rangel v. garland', 'mejia-alvarenga v. garland', 'zhao v. gonzales', 'dayo v. holder', 'tesfamichael v. gonzales', 'majd v. gonzales', 'qorane v. barr', 'gjetani v. barr', 'argueta-hernandez v. garland', 'munoz-granados v. barr', 'abdel-masieh v. ins', 'morales v. sessions', 'liu v. ashcroft', 'evelyne v. keisler', 'zho v. gonzales', 'maraziegos-morales v. garland', 'escobar-chavez v. i.n.s.', 'villavicencio-castillo v. i.n.s.', 'alvarado-molina v. i.n.s.', 'guillen cedio v. garland', 'guevara flores v. ins', 'eduard v. ashcroft', 'cabrera v. sessions', 'arif v. mukasey', 'efe v. ashcroft', 'ghotra v. whitaker']",[],[],0,0,0,
"Can a U.S. federal district court compel the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to adjudicate an alien's 35-year-old application for lawful permanent resident status under the laws and facts as they existed at the time of the original filing, specifically to enable the alien to seek a deportation waiver that was subsequently repealed, given the alien's intervening criminal conviction and fraudulent conduct?","No, a U.S. federal district court cannot compel such adjudication under these circumstances. The court ruled against Armando Garcia on both his claims. For his Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) claim, the court granted summary judgment to USCIS, concluding that USCIS had adequately searched for a record of any adjudication of his 1981 application, albeit unsuccessfully. For his claim seeking reconsideration and adjudication of his 1981 lawful permanent resident (LPR) request under the facts and law as they stood in 1981, the court granted Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. The court determined that Garcia lacked standing because his theory of relief was too speculative and spectral, requiring extraordinary *nunc pro tunc* equitable remedies. The court doubted its authority to grant such extensive *nunc pro tunc* relief, which would entail ignoring subsequent criminal convictions and changes in immigration laws, and found it unwarranted on equitable grounds due to Garcia's fraudulent behavior and delays.

"An individual, Mr. Rodriguez, is a long-time lawful permanent resident of the U.S. who has a final order of removal. After the initial 90-day statutory removal period, he is detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for an additional 10 months. During this prolonged detention, he alleges that federal immigration officials, knowing that his removal to his home country was not possible and that he was ineligible for removal to a third country, made false statements in official documents to justify his continued detention. Mr. Rodriguez seeks monetary damages against these federal officials under a *Bivens* action, claiming violations of his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights for unreasonable seizure and prolonged detention without due process. Can Mr. Rodriguez pursue a *Bivens* action for damages against the federal immigration officials under these circumstances?","No, Mr. Rodriguez cannot pursue a *Bivens* action for damages against the federal immigration officials for unconstitutionally prolonged detention under these circumstances, although federal courts do have subject matter jurisdiction to hear such a claim.

The court finds that claims challenging prolonged detention after the 90-day removal period, based on allegations that officials knew removal was impossible and prolonged detention for other reasons, do not ""arise from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders"" under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). Therefore, this specific type of claim is not barred by that jurisdictional statute.

However, the court holds that no *Bivens* remedy is available. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) is considered an ""elaborate remedial system"" that provides ""sufficient meaningful remedies"" for aliens, including numerous administrative review procedures and the availability of a writ of habeas corpus to challenge detention. Congress's frequent amendments to the INA without providing a damages remedy suggests a deliberate omission. The absence of monetary relief within this statutory scheme is not a sufficient reason to create a new *Bivens* remedy. Additionally, several ""special factors"" counsel against extending *Bivens* into this context: the breadth and detail of the INA itself, the importance of demonstrating due respect for the Constitution's separation of powers (Congress's power over naturalization and the Executive's role in foreign relations), and the doctrinal novelty and administrative difficulty of such a claim, which could lead to widespread litigation and potentially chill robust enforcement of immigration laws.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['santiago alvarez v. us immigration and customs enforcement', 'alvarez v. holder', 'united states v.', 'garcia uranga v. us citizenship & immigration services', 'webster v. doe', 'demore v. kim', 'mirmehdi v. united states', 'gupta v. mcgahey', 'ashcroft v. iqbal', 'bivens v. six unknown named agents of federal bureau of narcotics', 'carlson v. green', 'davis v. passman', 'de la paz v. coy', 'minneci v. pollard', 'wilkie v. robbins', 'zadvydas v. davis', 'arizona v. united states', 'lincoln v. vigil', 'doe', 'heck v. humphrey', 'reno v. flores', 'spencer v. kemna']",[],[],0,0,0,
"Under what circumstances can an immigrant investor compel USCIS to expedite the adjudication of their I-526 petition, particularly if they are from an underrepresented country and have waited for approximately 29 months, including a period when the underlying program was temporarily lapsed?","An immigrant investor generally cannot compel USCIS to expedite the adjudication of an I-526 petition under such circumstances. The court found that USCIS's processing, which prioritizes petitions from countries where visas are available or soon to be available and those with previously reviewed projects, operates under a ""rule of reason"" and a ""first-in, first-out"" order. While Congress expressed a ""sense"" that applications should be processed within 180 days, these timelines are ""precatory"" and ""non-binding."" A 29-month delay (including a 9-month lapse in the Regional Center Program's authorization) was not considered an ""unreasonable delay as a matter of law,"" especially given that courts often do not find delays between three to five years unreasonable. Granting relief would also unfairly place the petitioner ""at the head of the queue"" ahead of others who filed earlier, producing no net gain for the agency's competing priorities. Furthermore, alleged harms like investment risk and uncertainty about U.S. residency were deemed ""primarily personal and economic hardships"" not rising to the level of serious ""human health and welfare"" interests, and no bad faith by USCIS was established.","['8 U.S.C § 1153(b)(5)(A)(i)–(ii)', ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['punt v. united states citizenship & immigration services', 'khamrabaeva v. blinken', 'palakuru v. renaud', 'mirror lake village llc v. wolf', 'ashcroft v. iqbal', 'bell atl. corp. v. twombly', 'vietnam veterans of am. v. shineseki', 'brzezinski v. u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'mashpee wampanoag tribal council inc. v. norton', 'dastagir v. blinken', 'milligan v. pompeo', 'ctr. for sci. in the pub. int. v. fda', 'arab v. blinken', 'bega v. jaddou', 'natl assn of mfrs. v. sec', 'skalka v. kelly', 'sarlak v. pompeo', 'yavari v. pompeo', 'mokkapati v. mayorkas', 'zaman v. u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'meyou v. u.s. dept of state', 'telles v. mayorkas', 'desai v. u.s. citizenship and immigr. servs.', 'fangfang xu v. cissna', 'didban v. pompeo', 'mahmood v. u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'gona v. u.s. citizenship & immigration servs.', 'thakker v. renaud']","[{'title': '8 C.F.R. § 204.6', 'chunk': '8 C.F.R. § 204.6 sets forth requirements for classifying an alien under the EB-5 Program, including the filing of a Form I–526 Immigrant Petition by Alien Entrepreneur.'}]","[{'title': 'Matter of C-Y-Appeal of Immigrant Investor Program Office Decision Form I-526, Immigrant Petition By Alien Entrepreneur', 'chunk': 'Matter of C-Y-Appeal of Immigrant Investor Program Office Decision Form I-526 denied petitioner for failing to document fund transfers.

The court agrees with the Board of Immigration Appeals that ""business owner"" is not an immutable trait and therefore not a cognizable particular social group under immigration laws.

Furthermore, the court would decline to consider any new arguments, such as an alternative particular social group based on family status, challenges to policy changes, or the sufficiency of their initial Notices to Appear, because these arguments were not presented to the BIA and thus not administratively exhausted, as required by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1).

USCIS approved Dr. Sharma for H-1B classification but denied the domestic change-of-status request, requiring her to travel abroad. After HealthFirst filed suit, Dr. Sharma traveled outside the United States, obtained an H-1B visa, and reentered the U.S. as an H-1B nonimmigrant. HealthFirst also seeks a declaratory judgment challenging USCIS's alleged ""H-4 only"" policy for J-2 dependents, claiming it continues to negatively impact their ability to hire J-2 spouses in the future. HealthFirst asserts it will continue to file such petitions but has not identified any specific future J-2 candidates it wishes to hire. Can HealthFirst's lawsuit proceed?","No, HealthFirst's lawsuit cannot proceed. The challenge to the specific denial of the change-of-status request for Dr. Sharma is moot because Dr. Sharma has already obtained her H-1B visa, rendering it impossible to grant effective relief for that particular claim.

"An undocumented immigrant, Mr. Garcia, received a Notice to Appear (NTA) from the Department of Homeland Security in 2020 that charged him with removability but did not specify the date or time of his initial hearing. Mr. Garcia applied for cancellation of removal, arguing that his U.S. citizen child, who suffers from a severe, rare medical condition requiring ongoing specialized treatment, would face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if he were removed. He also sought administrative closure while pursuing a U visa. The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied cancellation of removal, finding Mr. Garcia failed to establish the requisite hardship and good moral character, and did not rule on the motion for administrative closure. On appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), Mr. Garcia argued the NTA was deficient, depriving the agency of jurisdiction or, alternatively, constituting a claim-processing error. He also challenged the IJ's hardship finding and reiterated his request for administrative closure. After the BIA dismissed his appeal, his U visa application was denied, and he was subsequently removed. Can Mr. Garcia successfully challenge the BIA's decision regarding the NTA deficiency, the hardship finding for cancellation of removal, or the denial of administrative closure?","No, Mr. Garcia cannot successfully challenge the BIA's decision on these grounds.
1.  **NTA Deficiency:** The omission of time and place information from a Notice to Appear (NTA) does not deprive the Immigration Judge of subject-matter jurisdiction over removal proceedings. Furthermore, an objection to a noncompliant NTA is a claim-processing rule that is waived or forfeited if not timely raised by the closing of pleadings before the IJ.
2.  **Exceptional Hardship for Cancellation of Removal:** While the application of the ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" standard is a mixed question of law and fact reviewable by the court, the agency's underlying factual findings are unreviewable. Taking the agency's factual findings as conclusive (unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary), such as the availability of transportation for medical appointments, sufficient involvement by the other parent, and adequate financial support, the agency did not err in determining that Mr. Garcia's removal would not result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his qualifying relative. The agency's no-hardship finding is dispositive, making it unnecessary to reach any flaws in a moral-character analysis.
3.  **Administrative Closure:** Mr. Garcia's claim that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion for administrative closure or a continuance has been mooted by the denial of his U visa application and his subsequent removal from the United States, as it is impossible for the court to grant him any effectual relief.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['sustaita-cordova v. garland', 'campos v. united states', 'niz-chavez v. garland', 'pereira v. sessions', 'rodriguez v. garland', 'garland v. ming dai', 'hernandez-castillo v. sessions', 'fuentes-pena v. barr', 'mendoza-flores v. rosen', 'nkenglefac v. garland', 'patel v. garland', 'castillo-gutierrez v. garland', 'wilkinson v. garland', 'carreon v. garland', 'saenz v. garland', 'ins v. bagamasbad', 'maniar v. garland', 'jimenez-rodriguez v. garland', 'meza morales v. barr', 'meridor v. u.s. atty gen.', 'hernandez v. garland 6th cir.', 'guerrero-lasprilla v. barr']",[],"[{'title': 'Long v.

"Under what circumstances can a U.S. federal court compel U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to expedite the adjudication of an I-526 immigrant investor visa petition that has been pending for over four years, where the plaintiff alleges unreasonable delay under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Mandamus Act?","A U.S. federal court would not compel USCIS to expedite an I-526 immigrant investor visa petition that has been pending for over four years if the plaintiff fails to plausibly allege unreasonable delay under the ""TRAC"" factors.

Although Congress has expressed a ""sense of Congress"" that applications should be completed within 180 days, this is aspirational and not a binding timeline (TRAC factor 2). The court also considered the approximate 4.3-year delay in light of significant external factors, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic and a nine-month lapse in statutory authorization for the EB-5 program. The plaintiff's alleged harms, described as ""health and human prejudices,"" financial harm, and the inability to acquire lawful permanent residency, were deemed primarily economic and inherent in the immigration process, thus insufficient to weigh TRAC factors 3 and 5 in his favor, especially in the absence of severe health concerns or family separation. Furthermore, compelling USCIS to expedite the plaintiff's petition would simply move him ahead of other similarly situated applicants, interfering with agency priorities and producing no net gain (TRAC factor 4). Lastly, the plaintiff failed to plausibly allege facts supporting agency impropriety, and the nine-month processing pause was compelled by law (TRAC factor 6, which remains neutral in the absence of impropriety).

"A private non-profit agency, ""Hope for New Arrivals,"" contracts with the state of ""Frontierland"" to provide social services to refugees using federal funds under a program similar to the Refugee Act. Frontierland's governor, citing unsubstantiated security concerns that refugees from ""Warlordia"" may pose a terrorist threat, instructs the state to withhold reimbursement for services provided by Hope for New Arrivals to any refugee whose country of origin is Warlordia. Federal law, similar to 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(5), mandates that services funded under this program be provided ""without regard to race, religion, nationality, sex, or political opinion."" Hope for New Arrivals sues to prevent the state from withholding funds. Should the court grant a preliminary injunction in favor of Hope for New Arrivals?","Yes, the court should grant the preliminary injunction. The federal law dictates that services funded under the refugee assistance program must be provided ""without regard to race, religion, nationality, sex, or political opinion."" The governor's policy of refusing to reimburse for services to refugees from a specific country, even if purportedly based on security fears, constitutes discrimination on the basis of nationality, which is explicitly forbidden by the federal statute. The governor's fears are presented without evidence and are deemed ""nightmare speculation,"" and state action cannot override federal responsibility for immigration and refugee regulation.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]",['exodus refugee immigration in v. michael pence'],"[{'title': 'U.S. Code Title 8 Section 1522', 'chunk': '**Section 412 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1522)**\n(As added Pub.

"An individual in removal proceedings sought cancellation of removal based on the ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" his removal would cause his U.S. citizen child, arguing significant involvement in his child's life and potential emotional, psychological, medical, and financial impacts. He also applied for voluntary departure, but the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) noted inconsistencies in his tax filings, which it referred to as ""tax fraud.""

1.  **Cancellation of Removal**: The court would agree with the BIA's determination that the emotional, psychological, medical, and financial hardships identified, while unfortunate, are ""common and normal"" consequences of an ordinary removal, and do not demonstrate an ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" substantially different from or beyond what would ordinarily be expected.
2.  **Voluntary Departure**: The court would likely find it lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA’s discretionary decision to deny voluntary departure. The BIA's reference to ""tax fraud"" in relation to misrepresentations on tax filings would be considered a summarization of factual findings concerning credibility and character, rather than a reviewable legal conclusion of criminal tax fraud.
3.  **Continuance**: The court would likely conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in affirming the immigration judge’s denial of the motion for a continuance, as the BIA utilized a ""perceptibl[y rational approach"" in weighing relevant factors.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['cuenca-arroyo v. garland', 'patel v. garland', 'wilkinson v. garland', 'orellana-monson v. holder', 'wang v. holder', 'netro gonzalez v. garland', 'carreon v. garland', 'delgado-victorio v. garland', 'ali v. gonzales', 'manzano-garcia v. gonzales', 'pritchett v. ins', 'figueroa ochoa v. garland', 'agard v. garland', 'alkotof v. u.s. atty gen.', 'steel co. v. citizens for a better envt', 'perez v. garland', 'garcia uranga v. us citizenship & immigration services', 'ogunfuye v. holder', 'guerrero-lasprilla v. barr', 'u.s. bank natl assn ex rel. cwcapital asset mgmt. llc v. vill. at lakeridge llc', 'mejia v. whitaker', 'bouarfa v. mayorkas', 'witter v. ins', 'zhao v. gonzales', 'ahmed v. gonzalez', 'ramchandani v. gonzales', 'masih v. mukasey', 'nen di wu v. holder', 'hammerschmidt v. garland']",[],[],0,0,0,

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has previously held that circularly defined social groups, such as those proposed by the petitioner, are not cognizable for asylum purposes. Because the proposed social groups—""Salvadoran women in domestic relationships who are unable to leave; or Salvadoran women who are viewed as property by virtue of their position in a domestic relationship""—are nearly identical to those previously rejected as circularly defined by the Fifth Circuit, remanding the case to the Immigration Judge would be futile.

"A non-citizen defendant, undocumented since age seven, pleads guilty to reduced drug charges in 2010, receiving a suspended sentence. In 2017, he faces deportation. His immigration attorneys inform him that his conviction makes him ineligible for cancellation of removal and permanently inadmissible to the U.S., which he alleges his trial counsel failed to clearly explain. His Motion for Appropriate Relief (MAR) for ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC) under *Padilla v. Kentucky*, and for his plea not being knowingly and voluntarily entered, is initially denied. After an appellate remand for an evidentiary hearing, the trial court again denies the MAR, concluding there was no prejudice because the defendant was already subject to deportation due to his undocumented status. On appeal, what is the likely ruling and reasoning of the appellate court regarding the trial court's order?","The appellate court would likely vacate the trial court's order in part and remand the case for further proceedings.

The appellate court would find that the trial court failed to make sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law on critical issues. Specifically, the trial court did not address the defendant's claims regarding the loss of eligibility for discretionary cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1) and permanent inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). For cancellation of removal, the trial court failed to make findings on the defendant's physical presence, good moral character, other convictions, or the hardship his removal would cause to his U.S. citizen child, which are all prerequisites for determining the statute's potential availability to the defendant. For both cancellation of removal and inadmissibility, the trial court did not properly evaluate prejudice by determining whether the defendant demonstrated a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial, including evaluating the credibility of his affidavit on this point.

Additionally, the appellate court would rule that the trial court erred by failing to comply with its prior order, which explicitly directed the trial court to resolve ""whether [Defendant’s plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered."" This issue was not addressed at all in the trial court's subsequent order.

The appellate court would, however, agree with the trial court that the specific deportability provision under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (deportation for conviction *after admission*) did not apply, as the defendant was never ""admitted"" to the U.S. Therefore, there could be no deficient performance or prejudice related to counsel's advice regarding that particular statute.

"Maya was arrested and held in the Smith County Jail on state misdemeanor charges. After posting bond for these charges, she was eligible for release. However, the Smith County Sheriff continued to detain Maya based on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer and an administrative arrest warrant (Form I-200) for civil immigration violations. The Smith County Sheriff's office has an active 287(g) agreement with ICE, authorizing its deputies to perform specific immigration enforcement functions. Maya's legal counsel filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in state superior court, arguing that her continued detention by the Sheriff was unlawful because the federal detainer lacked probable cause and the Sheriff lacked state authority to detain her for civil immigration purposes. The petition explicitly mentioned the Sheriff's 287(g) agreement. Should the state superior court grant Maya's request for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus and order her discharge?","No, the state superior court should deny Maya's request for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus and her discharge. While the trial judge has the authority to determine whether it is entitled to act upon the petition, it should summarily deny an application that alleges the petitioner is being held pursuant to an immigration-related arrest warrant or detainer by a sheriff who is a party to a 287(g) agreement with the federal government. The application, by explicitly stating that Maya is being held pursuant to an immigration detainer and I-200 Form, and acknowledging the Sheriff's 287(g) agreement, informs the state court that its state law authority to inquire into the lawfulness of the detention is superseded by federal law. A state court lacks the power to look behind the Sheriff's claim that the petitioner is being held pursuant to a valid immigration-related process under a 287(g) agreement, as the Sheriff is acting as a de facto immigration officer in such circumstances. Challenges to the validity of the immigration process itself are reserved for federal, not state, judicial officials.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['chavez v. mcfadden', 'chavez v. carmichael', 'roberts v. madison cty. realtors assn', 'knox v. serv. emps. intl union local', 'cape fear river watch v. n.c. envtl mgmt. commn', 'little v. wachovia bank & tr. co.', 'citizens natl bank v. grandfather home for children inc.', 'benvenue parent-teacher assn v. nash cty. bd. of educ.', 'n.c. state bar v. randolph', 'cooper v. berger', 'shell island homeowners assn v. tomlinson', 'state v. parks', 'state v. niccum', 'arizona v. united states', 'toll v. moreno', 'united states v.', 'city of el cenizo v. texas', 'hayes v. city of wilmington', 'burgess v. gibbs', 'nyquist v. mauclet']",[],[],0,0,0,

Will a U.S. federal court likely grant their motion for a TRO?","No, a U.S. federal court will likely deny the motion for a TRO. The plaintiffs failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits, primarily because they did not demonstrate standing, as the individual plaintiffs did not have imminent in-person hearings, and the organizational plaintiffs could not show that judges regularly denied requests for remote appearances or continuances. Moreover, the Immigration and Nationality Act's jurisdiction-channeling provisions likely foreclose access-to-counsel and due process claims, directing such challenges to federal courts of appeals, not district courts. Regarding the APA claims, the court found the challenged policies were not ""final agency action"" because legal consequences flow from individual immigration judge decisions rather than the general policies themselves. The court also determined there was no ""failure-to-act"" claim as plaintiffs could not point to a specific statutory obligation requiring the defendants to take the requested actions, and the defendants' policies were not arbitrary and capricious given the rapidly evolving public health crisis. Furthermore, the plaintiffs did not establish they would suffer imminent irreparable injury, and the balance of equities and public interest did not favor imposing a broad, one-size-fits-all injunctive relief on the government's efforts to manage the immigration system while responding to the pandemic.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['national immigration project of the national lawyers guild v. executive office of immigration review', 'winter v. nat. res. def. council inc.', 'cityfed fin. corp. v. office of thrift supervision', 'steel co. v. citizens for a better envt', 'lujan v. defs. of wildlife', 'spokeo inc. v. robbins', 'arpaio v. obama', 'j.e.f.m. v. lynch', 'o.a. v. trump', 'aguilar v. u.s. immigration & customs enft div. of dept of homeland sec.', 'jennings v. rodriguez', 'p.l. v. u.s. immigration & customs enft', 'sierra club v. epa', 'bennett v. spear', 'norton v. s. utah wilderness all.', 'cobell v. norton', 'clark v. clark', 'davis v. pension benefit guar. corp.', 'pursuing am.s greatness v. fec']","[{'title': 'Section 212(a)(9)(B)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act', 'chunk': 'Section 212(a)(9)(B)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is referenced in a court case regarding redactions in CBP documents related to immigration law enforcement.'}, {'title': 'section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act', 'chunk': ""The case concerns an alien's removability under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

The court found that USCIS's interpretation of 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e)—that third-party loan proceeds invested as cash are properly characterized as ""indebtedness"" requiring personal collateralization—is plainly erroneous. The regulation unambiguously defines ""capital"" to include ""cash,"" and the ordinary meaning of ""cash"" encompasses cash loan proceeds. The court clarified that the regulation directs the agency to identify the asset *actually contributed* to the enterprise, which in this scenario is cash. The collateralization requirement for ""indebtedness"" only applies when the investor contributes a promise to pay (indebtedness to the enterprise itself), not when the enterprise receives readily deployable cash. Furthermore, USCIS's interpretation effectively amends the regulation by adding a new requirement for cash investments without proper notice and comment, thus violating the Administrative Procedure Act.

"An Iranian national applies for an EB-5 immigrant investor visa, claiming to have invested $500,000 from the sale of gold coins, rental income, and her husband's income. Due to sanctions, she used third-party trading companies in Dubai to transfer the funds to the U.S. investment. Her application includes an invoice for the gold coin sale with a discrepancy between ""tomans"" and ""rials"" for the total amount, and she cannot provide direct wire transfer records from her Iranian bank account to the Dubai entities, nor can she get written statements from the individuals who facilitated the transfers due to their refusal. She provides an affidavit explaining the situation and confirming the source of funds. If the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) denies her application based on (1) insufficient documentation of the complete path of funds from her personal account to the Dubai entities and (2) the currency discrepancy in the gold coin sale invoice, and she appeals to a U.S. District Court, how should the court rule?","The court should affirm the AAO's denial of the EB-5 visa application. The AAO was within its discretion to demand evidence tracing the funds from the applicant's bank account to the wiring entities, even if the applicant faced difficulties due to banking restrictions and third-party non-cooperation. The applicant's unsupported affidavit regarding the movement of funds through an unidentified person is insufficient to meet the burden of proof, as the agency relies on the absence of corroborating evidence. Furthermore, the AAO, exercising de novo review, was permitted to identify and base its denial on the currency discrepancy in the gold coin invoice, even if it was not raised in the initial denial, because the inconsistency was present in a document submitted by the applicant herself and did not require the agency to provide an opportunity to rebut derogatory information unknown to the applicant. The court cannot reweigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the agency on factual findings. Since both grounds for the AAO's denial are independent and valid, the agency's action was not arbitrary and capricious.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['sadeghzadeh v. united states citizenship & immigration services', 'am. bioscience inc. v. thompson', 'doe', 'motor vehicle mfrs. assn of u.s. inc. v. state farm mut. auto. ins.', 'ctr. for food safety v. salazar', 'pierce v. sec', 'carnegie natl gas co. v. ferc', 'soltane v. u.s. dept of justice', 'taco especial v. napolitano']",[],"[{'title': 'Matter of C-Y-Appeal of Immigrant Investor Program Office Decision Form I-526, Immigrant Petition By Alien Entrepreneur', 'chunk': 'Matter of C-Y-Appeal of Immigrant Investor Program Office Decision Form I-526 denied petitioner for failing to document fund transfers.

"A foreign investor seeks an EB-5 visa through a regional center, proposing to invest $500,000 in a new commercial enterprise (NCE) that will loan funds to multiple job-creating entities (JCEs) for various mining projects in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA). At the time of filing the Form I-526 petition, the investor's business plan and offering memorandum list four potential mining locations, but explicitly state that not all have been formally approved, and alternative or additional projects are unspecified and unapproved if initial projects fall through or require less funding. The plan includes an economic report projecting job creation based on mining expenditures but without specific JCE locations. USCIS denies the petition, citing failure to establish TEA qualification and job creation at the time of filing, and views subsequent clarification of JCE locations as an impermissible material change. Can the investor successfully challenge this denial, arguing that the NCE was clearly intended to operate in a TEA and that their economic report adequately demonstrated job creation potential, irrespective of specific JCE locations at filing?","No, the investor cannot successfully challenge the denial. A U.S. District Court has upheld USCIS's denial of similar EB-5 visa petitions on two independent grounds: (1) failure to establish that the Job Creating Entities (JCEs) were principally doing business in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA) at the time of filing, and (2) failure to establish that the investments would create full-time positions for at least ten qualifying employees at the time of filing. For regional center investments, the ""principally doing business"" requirement applies to the JCEs, not the New Commercial Enterprise (NCE). The Court found it reasonable for USCIS to conclude that the investor failed to meet the TEA requirement because the JCEs were not fully identified or approved at the time of filing, making it impossible to determine if the $500,000 TEA investment threshold was met. Furthermore, changes to JCE locations after filing were deemed impermissible material changes affecting eligibility. Regarding job creation, the Court found that the initial business plan, lacking specified JCE locations, was not sufficiently comprehensive to support a credible economic analysis for prospective job creation at the time of filing. USCIS could not assess the reasonableness of assumptions about the geographic impact of projects without this information. Subsequent economic reports based on later-identified JCEs were also rejected due to the material change doctrine, which requires eligibility to be established at the time of filing.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['united states v.', 'am. bioscience inc. v. thompson', 'southeast conference v. vilsack', 'fcc v. fox television stations inc.', 'ctr. for food safety v. salazar', 'motor vehicle mfrs. assn of u.s. inc. v. state farm mut. auto. ins.', 'dist. hosp. partners l.p. v. burwell', 'citizens to preserve overton park inc. v. volpe', 'assoc. of data processing serv. orgs. inc. v. bd. of govs. of fed. reserve sys.', 'indiana municipal power agency v. ferc', 'sussex engineering ltd. v. montgomery', 'fogo de chao holdings inc. v. u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'wang v. uscis', 'kungys v. united states', 'yang v. holder']",[],"[{'title': 'Matter of C-Y-Appeal of Immigrant Investor Program Office Decision Form I-526, Immigrant Petition By Alien Entrepreneur', 'chunk': 'Matter of C-Y-Appeal of Immigrant Investor Program Office Decision Form I-526 denied petitioner for failing to document fund transfers.

"Will a federal court review a challenge to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' (USCIS) 2020 update to its Policy Manual, which added a geographic redeployment requirement for EB-5 visa applications, when no investor applicant has yet been subjected to its application?","No, a federal court will not review such a challenge. The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss based on changed circumstances (mootness), but granted the defendants' motion to dismiss because the plaintiffs' claims were not yet ripe. The court found that further factual development was necessary to determine if the 2020 Update had a binding legal effect, if USCIS had characterized it as binding, or if it had been applied to any party. Additionally, the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate sufficient hardship, as their fears of adverse agency action were too remote, particularly given that the EB-5 Regional Center Program lacked statutory authorization at the time and the regulatory regime was unclear on terminating regional centers based on geographic redeployment.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '1153'), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['us immigration fund-ny llc v. pekoske', 'civitas mass. regional ctr. v. mayorkas', 'bromfman v. uscis', 'kokkonen v. guardian life ins. co. of am.', 'bagherian v. pompeo', 'coal. for underground expansion v. mineta', 'herbert v. natl acad. of scis.', 'settles v. u.s. parole commn', 'koutny v. martin', 'grand lodge of fraternal order of police v. ashcroft', 'trudeau v. fed. trade commn', 'papasan v. allain', 'bell atl. corp. v. twombly', 'conley v. gibson', 'ashcroft v. iqbal', 'daimlerchrysler corp. v. cuno', 'mcbryde v. comm. to review', 'arizonans for official english v. arizona', 'texas v. united states', 'am. petrol. inst. v. epa', 'natl park hospitality assn v. dept of interior', 'abbott labs v. gardner', 'her majesty the queen in right of ontario v. epa', 'ciba-geigy corp. v. epa', 'friends of animals v. u.s. bureau of land mgmt.', 'valero energy corp. v. epa', 'truckers united for safety v. fed. highway admin.']",[],"[{'title': 'U.S. IMMIGRATION FUND-NY LLC, et al., v.

"Nikunj Devani, a citizen of India, filed an EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program petition (Form I-526) in October 2019, which USCIS has yet to process. He alleges unreasonable delay, seeking to compel USCIS to adjudicate his petition, despite USCIS's visa availability approach and a 9-month lapse in the Regional Center Program's authorization. Will the court compel USCIS to expedite processing of his I-526 petition, considering the TRAC factors for unreasonable delay?","No, the court will dismiss Devani's action, denying his request to compel USCIS to process his I-526 petition. The court found that Devani failed to state a plausible claim of unreasonable delay under the TRAC factors.
1.  **Rule of Reason & Congressional Timetable:** USCIS's visa availability approach, which processes petitions on a modified ""first-in, first-out"" basis prioritizing petitioners from countries below visa caps, constitutes a rule of reason. Congress has not mandated a binding timeline for I-526 processing; the ""sense of Congress"" resolution is merely hortatory. The effective 32-month delay (accounting for a 9-month lapse in statutory authority) is not unreasonable, especially compared to the current average 52-month processing time for Indian applicants.
2.  **Prejudice to Health, Welfare, and Other Interests:** Devani's alleged financial and immigration-related harms (uncertainty) are considered inherent risks of the I-526 application process and do not rise to the level of harm, such as significant threats to physical health or safety, typically warranting intervention under these factors.
3.  **Agency's Competing Priorities:** Granting relief would require USCIS to reorder its priorities, placing Devani ahead of other similarly situated petitioners in the existing backlog, which the court is hesitant to do.
4.  **Impropriety:** Devani did not plausibly allege any facts of impropriety by USCIS. The 9-month pause in processing was due to a lapse in statutory authorization, not agency misconduct.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), '8 USC § 1571(b)']","['devani v. united states citizenship & immigration services uscis', 'da costa v. immigr. inv. program off.', 'vafaei v. united states citizenship & immigration services uscis', 'bromfman v. uscis', 'bega v. jaddou', 'bell atl. corp. v. twombly', 'ashcroft v. iqbal', 'hettinga v. united states', 'skalka v. kelly', 'didban v. pompeo', 'telecommunications research & action center v. fcc', 'palakuru v. renaud', 'sarlak v. pompeo', 'addala v. renaud', 'ctr. for sci. in the pub. int. v. fda', 'emergency coal. to defend educ. travel v. dept of treasury', 'arab v. blinken', 'cannon v. district of columbia', 'thakker v. renaud', 'telles v. mayorkas', 'behring regl ctr. llc v. mayorkas', 'milligan v. pompeo', 'mashpee wampanoag tribal council inc. v. norton', 'sanchez-mercedes v. bureau of prisons', 'bagherian v. pompeo']",[],"[{'title': 'Devani v.

"A U.S. citizen sponsoring an immigrant spouse through a USCIS Form I-864 Affidavit of Support has separated from the spouse. The immigrant spouse seeks damages for breach of the Affidavit of Support, repayment of a personal loan, and attorney's fees. What are the legal obligations of the sponsor regarding the Affidavit of Support, including the relevant household size and income calculations, and what remedies are available for the loan and fees?","The trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the Affidavit of Support claims for all relevant years, as the plaintiff's prayer for relief covered all damages. However, the trial court erred by calculating damages using the 125% Federal Poverty Level (FPL) Guidelines for a two-person household; it should have used the guidelines for a one-person household, as the child was a U.S. citizen and not a sponsored alien. The trial court did not err by calculating the sponsored immigrant's income using Adjusted Gross Income, allowing for the deduction of depreciation expenses.

Regarding the personal loan, the defendant's argument that an implied-in-fact contract existed (instead of a quasi-contract) was waived because it contradicted their position at trial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not crediting the defendant for ""sweat equity"" on other properties when fashioning the equitable remedy for the loan used to purchase the income-producing property. The trial court did err by awarding repayment of the loan in U.S. Dollars (USD) instead of Australian Dollars (AUD); the award must be converted to AUD on remand.

The trial court's decision to hold an additional conference before the final order was entered, and any missing portions of the trial transcript, did not constitute reversible error because the defendant failed to show prejudice. Finally, the trial court did not err by awarding reasonable attorney's fees to the immigrant spouse for prevailing on her Affidavit of Support claims, though the amount may be reconsidered on remand due to the reduction in damages owed.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['pelc v. pham', 'mckoy v. mckoy', 'suozzo v. suozzo', 'zhu v. deng', 'martin v. n.c. dept. of health & human servs.', 'anderson v. anderson', 'barnett v. barnett', 'erler v. erler erler i', 'wenfang liu v. mund', 'younis v. farooqi', 'flores v. flores', 'n.c. ins. guar. assn v. weathersfield mgmt.', 'erler v. erler erler ii', 'villars v. villars', 'tohato inc. v. pinewild mgmt.', 'state v. sharpe', 'weil v. herring', 'kinlaw v. harris', 'bartlett milling co. v. walnut grove auction & realty']","[{'title': 'U.S. Code Title 8 Section 1183a', 'chunk': 'This summary pertains to 8 U.S.C. 1183a, titled ""Requirements for sponsor’s affidavit of support.""\nThe section 213A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (which is 8 U.S.C. 1183a) was added by Pub.

"Under what circumstances, as per the District Court's ruling, can a coalition challenge specific immigration policy changes for lack of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and what types of challenges are generally dismissed?","A coalition can challenge specific immigration policy changes for lack of NEPA review under the APA if at least one plaintiff has constitutional standing and the claims fall within NEPA's zone of interests. For standing, a plaintiff must show a concrete procedural injury under NEPA, impairment of concrete environmental interests (e.g., direct harm to land, disruption of enjoyment), causation (a demonstrable increase in risk to particularized interests due to non-compliance), and redressability (the court ordering the agency to undertake the procedure could mitigate harm). The alleged injuries must have a sufficiently close connection to the physical environment.

However, challenges are dismissed if they are:
1.  **To an agency's NEPA instruction manual:** Such a manual is not considered ""final agency action"" under the APA if it is not the consummation of the agency’s decision-making process and does not create new legal obligations or impose legal consequences.
2.  **A broad ""programmatic"" challenge:** The APA limits review to ""discrete"" agency actions, precluding broad programmatic attacks that lump together numerous diffuse policy changes without identifying a single order, regulation, or completed universe of orders and regulations.
3.  **Barred by specific statutory schemes:** While challenges to generally applicable rules or policies regarding immigration (like administrative closure or rescission of certain ""Remain in Mexico"" policies) are reviewable, challenges to individual orders of removal or actions committed to agency discretion by law are generally not. The court specifically noted that INA provisions channeling review of removal orders to circuit courts do not bar challenges to the lack of NEPA analysis for general policy changes.

Specific immigration policy changes that survived dismissal in this case for potential NEPA review include:
*   Ending construction of the southern border wall.
*   Terminating ""Remain in Mexico"" policies (Migrant Protection Protocols, Asylum Cooperative Agreements, Prompt Asylum Claim Review, Humanitarian Asylum Review Process).
*   Allowing border patrol agents to grant permission for aliens to stay and helping them board buses.
*   Preventing immigration officials from detaining and removing aliens (challenging the general policy, not individual decisions).
*   Ending the practice of fining aliens for failing to leave the country (challenging the general policy).
*   Reinstating administrative closure in immigration courts.
*   Expanding various refugee programs (challenging the Department of State's actions to resettle refugees, specifically its requests for proposals and awards to grantees, rather than the Presidential refugee admission ceiling).","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['massachusetts coalition for immigration reform v. us citizenship and immigration services', 'robertson v. methow valley citizens council', 'competitive enter. inst. v. natl highway traffic safety admin.', 'lujan v. defs. of wildlife', 'lujan v. natl wildlife fedn', 'lexmark intl inc. v. static control components inc.', 'cement kiln recycling corp. v. epa', 'ashcroft v. iqbal', 'bell atl. corp. v. twombly', 'banneker ventures llc v. graham', 'fund for animals inc. v. u.s. bureau of land mgmt.', 'bennett v. spear', 'block v. cmty. nutrition inst.', 'heckler v. chaney', 'sierra club v. jackson', 'scenic am. inc. v. u.s. dept of transp.', 'cal. cattlemens assn v. u.s. fish & wildlife serv.', 'osborn v. visa inc.', 'summers v. earth island inst.', 'gunpowder riverkeeper v. ferc', 'mountain states legal found. v. glickman', 'spokeo inc. v. robbins', 'city of dania beach fla. v. faa', 'cal. cmtys. against toxics v. epa', 'united transp. union v. icc', 'city of los angeles v. lyons', 'sugar cane growers coop. of fla. v. veneman', 'fla. audubon socy v. bentsen', 'arpaio v. obama', 'metro. edison co. v. people against nuclear energy', 'soundboard assn v. ftc', 'whitman v. am. trucking assns', 'darby v. cisneros', 'holistic candlers & consumers assn v. fda', 'natl assn of home builders v. norton', 'sierra club v. epa', 'natl min. assn v. mccarthy', 'catawaba cnty. v. epa', 'norton v. s. utah wilderness all.', 'arizona v. mayorkas', 'am. fedn of govt. emps. afl-cio v. trump', 'i.n.s. v. st. cyr', 'jennings v. rodriguez', 'j.e.f.m. v. lynch', 'o.a. v. trump', 'center for biological diversity v. trump', 'natl audubon socy inc. v. watt', 'las ams. immigrant advoc. ctr. v. wolf', 'lincoln v. vigil', 'texas v. united states', 'arizona v. biden', 'united states v. texas', 'zukerman v. usps', 'biden v. texas', 'texas v. biden']","[{'title': 'National Environmental Policy Act', 'chunk': 'The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to analyze environmental effects of major actions.'}, {'title': 'Administrative Procedure Act', 'chunk': 'The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) is referenced in the case of Stellar IT Solutions, Inc. v.

"A noncitizen defendant seeks to withdraw a guilty plea, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to advise him of the adverse immigration consequences, specifically that relief under INA Section 212(c) was unavailable. The defendant states in an affidavit that he would not have pleaded guilty if he had known this. The trial court also provided a general advisement under R.C. 2943.031. The defendant had strong ties to the U.S. and faced severe charges, but also had potential grounds for dismissal or acquittal.

To establish prejudice for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the plea context, the defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. In this situation, the defendant's affidavit alone is insufficient without contemporaneous evidence to substantiate that avoiding deportation was the determinative issue. The record lacks evidence of the defendant's motivations beyond the affidavit, especially since counsel invoked attorney-client privilege. Furthermore, despite receiving advice that relief under Section 212(c) was discretionary and not assured, the defendant still pleaded guilty to a deportable offense. The trial court also provided a statutory advisement about potential deportation consequences, and there is no indication the defendant misunderstood it. Finally, the defendant faced significantly harsher consequences (18 felony counts, including first-degree rape, with potential life sentences and firearm specifications) by going to trial compared to the plea agreement (sexual battery and attempted abduction with suspended sentences and probation), making the decision to plead guilty appear rational.

"An individual, a native of Tanzania, entered the U.S. on a student visa and subsequently married a U.S. citizen. This marriage was later annulled, but before the annulment, the U.S. citizen spouse filed an I-130 petition on the individual's behalf, which was later denied due to the U.S. citizen spouse's fraudulent multiple marriages. The individual then married a second U.S. citizen, claiming battery and extreme cruelty, and filed an I-360 self-petition. The USCIS and AAO denied this I-360 petition, citing the previous marriage as fraudulent under Section 204(c) and also finding a failure to prove good faith in the second marriage. The individual appeals, arguing that the annulment means the first marriage never existed and that the previous I-130 denial should not apply to the current I-360 petition. Is the agency's decision to deny the I-360 petition, based on the prior fraudulent marriage and lack of good faith in the second marriage, arbitrary or capricious?","No, the agency's decision to deny the I-360 petition was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The court found that there was more than enough evidence to support the conclusion that the plaintiff and his first U.S. citizen spouse did not marry in good faith, given the spouse's conviction for marriage fraud involving five marriages. The fact that the plaintiff obtained an annulment did not establish his intent at the time of the marriage. Therefore, the I-360 petition was properly denied because the plaintiff had previously sought immediate relative status based on a marriage determined to be for the purpose of evading immigration laws, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c).

"In an Administrative Procedure Act (APA) challenge to the denial of an I-129 immigration petition by USCIS, where the plaintiffs reside in Washington and the petition was adjudicated by a USCIS service center in California, can the case initially filed in the District of Columbia be transferred to another district, and what factors guide such a transfer decision?","Yes, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia can transfer such a case to another district, specifically to the Central District of California, based on the court's authority under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) for the ""convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice.""

The court's decision is guided by a two-fold inquiry:
1.  **Could the case have been brought in the transferee district?** Yes, both the Central District of California (where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred, as the USCIS California Service Center adjudicated the petition) and the Western District of Washington (where the plaintiffs reside) are proper venues under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).
2.  **Do private and public interests favor transfer?** The court found that these interests largely weigh in favor of transfer to the Central District of California.
    *   **Preferred forum:** While plaintiffs preferred D.C., the deference to their choice was lessened because D.C. is not their home forum and lacks meaningful ties to the controversy. The USCIS headquarters had relocated from D.C., and the remaining D.C. offices were not involved in the petition's adjudication.
    *   **Location where the claim arose:** The claim arose in the Central District of California, where the challenged federal action (the petition denial) occurred, supporting the local interest in deciding controversies at home.
    *   **Convenience:** The Central District of California is the more convenient forum as the field office most familiar with the facts of the application is located there, and any relief granted would apply to officials in that district.
    *   **Relative congestion of the courts and familiarity with governing law:** These factors were considered neutral, as statistics on congestion were mixed, and all federal judges are presumed familiar with federal laws, including immigration disputes and the APA.

Consequently, the court granted the motion to transfer the case to the Central District of California and did not address the defendant's motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction or improper venue.","[('cfr', '8', '')]","['wei lai development llc v. united states citizenship and immigration services', 'one on one basketball inc. v. glob. payments direct inc.', 'van dusen v. barrack', 'aracely v. nielsen', 'ike v. uscis', 'abusadeh v. chertoff no.', 'pasem v. uscis', 'gyau v. sessions', 'norton v. s. utah wilderness all.', 'islamic republic of iran v. boeing co.', 'efficientip inc. v. cuccinelli no.', 'onaghise v. u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'adams v. bell', 'bahena v. renaud', 'ngonga v. sessions', 'wolfram alpha llc v. cuccinelli', 'al-ahmed v. chertoff', 'bourdon v. u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'chauhan v. napolitano', 'natl assn of home builders v. epa', 'aftab v. gonzalez', 'w. watersheds project v. pool', 'mohammadi v. scharfen', 'ruhrgas ag v. marathon oil co.', 'producers of renewables united for integrity truth & transparency v. epa', 'pac. mar. assn v. nlrb']",[],"[{'title': 'Ike v.

"Can a U.S. lawful permanent resident successfully sue the U.S. State Department for unreasonable delay in processing an immigrant visa for their spouse under the Administrative Procedure Act, or for violating their Fifth Amendment due process rights, given a processing delay of under two years exacerbated by a global pandemic?","No, a U.S. lawful permanent resident cannot successfully sue the U.S. State Department for unreasonable delay or Fifth Amendment due process violations under these circumstances.

The Court dismissed the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claim for unreasonable delay because:
1.  The State Department's practice of processing visa applications on a first-in, first-out basis is considered a ""rule of reason"" for decision-making, and Congress has not established a specific statutory timetable for visa processing.
2.  A delay of approximately fourteen months (less than two years) is not deemed unreasonable as a matter of law, especially given the extraordinary backlog of cases (increasing from approximately 75,000 to 473,000) and the disruption to services caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.
3.  Granting relief would place the plaintiff ahead of other similarly situated applicants, interfering with the State Department's allocation of resources and its prioritization of ""mission critical"" functions during the pandemic.
4.  The plaintiff's broad allegations regarding the delay's toll on his physical and mental health and the harm to his family were insufficient to meet the criteria for human health and welfare or other interests prejudiced by the delay.
5.  No impropriety or bad faith on the part of the agency was alleged.
Consequently, the mandamus action based on the APA claim also failed.

The Court dismissed the Fifth Amendment due process claims (both substantive and procedural) because:
1.  There is no fundamental liberty interest in having a spouse's visa application granted or processed more quickly, as admission of aliens to the United States is a privilege granted by the sovereign, not a right. The Supreme Court precedent, such as *Kerry v. Din*, explicitly forecloses such a substantive due process argument.
2.  Since there is no protected liberty or property interest at stake in an immigrant visa and a process governed by a rule of reason exists for applicants, there can be no procedural due process violation.
The plaintiff's equal protection claim, also a Fifth Amendment claim, was dismissed as a matter of law for similar reasons.

Claims against the DHS defendants were dismissed as moot because the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) had already approved the I-130 petition and transferred it to the National Visa Center, completing its role in the process. Additionally, claims concerning the Controlled Application Review and Resolution Program (CARRP) were dismissed as moot against DHS and constitutionally unripe against the State Department, as CARRP is a DHS policy.","[('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '22', ''), ('cfr', '22', ''), ('cfr', '22', ''), ('cfr', '22', '')]","['manzoor v. united states citizenship and immigration services', 'jafarzadeh v. duke', 'us immigration fund-ny llc v. pekoske', 'coal. for underground expansion v. mineta', 'herbert v. natl acad. of scis.', 'settles v. u.s. parole commn', 'koutny v. martin', 'grand lodge of fraternal order of police v. ashcroft', 'trudeau v. fed. trade commn', 'papasan v. allain', 'ashcroft v. iqbal', 'bell atl. corp. v. twombly', 'natl postal profl nurses v. u.s. postal serv.', 'ward v. d.c. dept of youth rehab. servs.', 'gustaveschmidt v. chao', 'hinton v. corr. corp. of am.', 'abhe & svoboda inc. v. chao', 'bagherian v. pompeo', 'united states v.', 'willson v. commr', 'jingjing v. mayorkas', 'telecommunications research & action center v. fcc', 'mashpee wampanoag tribal council inc. v. norton', 'palakuru v. renaud', 'muvvala v. wolf', 'xiaobing liu v. blinken', 'skalka v. kelly', 'fangfang xu v. cissna', 'yavari v. pompeo', 'ren v. mueller', 'nibber v. u.s. citizenship & immigr. servs.', 'tate v. pompeo', 'thakker v. renaud', 'nohria v. renaud', 'kangarloo v. pompeo', 'obergefell v. hodges', 'washington v. glucksberg', 'moore v. city of e. cleveland', 'kerry v. din', 'colindres v. u.s. dept of state', 'smirnov v. clinton', 'mathews v. eldridge']","[{'title': 'Fifth Amendment', 'chunk': 'The Fifth Amendment was cited in a case where plaintiffs argued the denial of their EB-5 visa petitions was unconstitutional; the court found no violation of their rights under the amendment and granted summary judgment to the defendants.'}]","[{'title': 'Zaman v.

"An EB-5 investor, John, filed a Form I-526 petition based on an investment in a limited partnership that included a ""Call Option"" allowing the general partner to repurchase John's interest for a fixed amount if the business was successful.

Concurrently, other investors in the same partnership, who submitted functionally identical petitions, received different denial notices from USCIS, citing various other reasons or fewer reasons for denial, with no explanation for the varied treatment. If John challenges USCIS's decision under the Administrative Procedure Act, what is the likely outcome regarding the ""at risk"" determination and the disparate treatment of petitions?","The court would likely find that USCIS's reasoning in denying John's petition on the grounds that the Call Option made his capital not ""at risk"" and constituted a ""guaranteed return"" was arbitrary and capricious, as the Call Option did not guarantee the return of capital regardless of the business's success or failure, nor did it provide the investor with any rights to exercise it. Additionally, the court would likely find that USCIS acted arbitrarily and capriciously by issuing different denial notices with varying reasons to functionally equivalent petitions without providing any explanation for the disparate treatment. The appropriate remedy would be to remand John's petition to USCIS for reconsideration consistent with the court's opinion, requiring USCIS to either treat all similar petitions in the same manner or sufficiently explain any reasons for treating them differently.

If the application does not initially reveal this, but the sheriff's return claims the petitioner is held under such federal authority via a 287(g) agreement, the trial court must then deny the request for discharge. State courts lack the authority to inquire into the validity of federal immigration processes or to interfere with detentions made under a 287(g) agreement, as such matters fall under exclusive federal jurisdiction. The remedy for any alleged unlawful imprisonment in these circumstances lies exclusively with federal courts.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['chavez v. mcfadden', 'chavez v. carmichael', 'roberts v. madison cty. realtors assn', 'knox v. serv. emps. intl union local', 'cape fear river watch v. n.c. envtl mgmt. commn', 'little v. wachovia bank & tr. co.', 'citizens natl bank v. grandfather home for children inc.', 'benvenue parent-teacher assn v. nash cty. bd. of educ.', 'n.c. state bar v. randolph', 'cooper v. berger', 'shell island homeowners assn v. tomlinson', 'state v. parks', 'state v. niccum', 'arizona v. united states', 'toll v. moreno', 'united states v.', 'city of el cenizo v. texas', 'hayes v. city of wilmington', 'burgess v. gibbs', 'nyquist v. mauclet']",[],[],0,0,0,
"A lawful permanent resident, who is a non-English speaker with significant ties to his country of origin, pleads guilty to an aggravated felony that mandates deportation. His attorney did not explicitly advise him of the mandatory deportation consequences, and he did not request an interpreter during the plea hearing. He claims he did not fully understand the proceedings and that avoiding deportation was his primary concern, despite telling the judge at the time of the plea that he understood the potential for deportation. The trial court advised him of the possibility of deportation as required by statute, and he responded affirmatively when asked if he understood. He seeks to withdraw his plea four years later, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel and a violation of his right to an interpreter. Should the trial court grant his motion to withdraw his guilty plea?","No. A trial court should not grant a post-sentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea unless the defendant demonstrates a ""manifest injustice,"" a showing that rests on the defendant to prove extraordinary circumstances. To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must show both that counsel's performance was deficient and that, but for counsel's errors, there is a reasonable probability the result of the proceeding would have been different (prejudice). Here, even assuming counsel was deficient in not explicitly advising on mandatory deportation, the defendant could not demonstrate prejudice. Factors weighing against a finding of prejudice include: (1) Strong evidence of guilt presented by the State (video, witnesses); (2) The defendant's stated primary goal at the time of the plea was to receive probation, not to avoid deportation; (3) The defendant was aware of an ICE detainer prior to entering his plea, making his assertion of unawareness of deportation consequences not credible; (4) The defendant's limited ties to the United States and strong ties to his country of origin (unemployed, did not reside with his U.S. citizen wife, child in Haiti, only intended a brief vacation); (5) The trial court properly advised the defendant, pursuant to R.C. 2943.031(A), that his conviction could result in deportation, exclusion, or denial of naturalization, and the defendant acknowledged understanding this advisement without asking questions; (6) The defendant acknowledged reviewing and understanding the plea form, which stated his understanding of consequences for non-U.S. citizens; and (7) An unreasonable delay of four years in filing the motion to withdraw the plea. Regarding the interpreter claim, the trial court made adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law, noting the defendant's demonstrated proficiency in English during various proceedings (responding appropriately to questions, writing his version of events, communicating with probation officers without an interpreter) and that he never requested an interpreter.","[('usc', '8', '1227'), ('usc', '8', '1228'), ('usc', '8', '1101'), ('usc', '8', '1182')]","['state v. pierre', 'strickland v. washington', 'state v. woodfork', 'state v. smith', 'state v. turner', 'state v. gilbreath', 'state v. rozell', 'state v. darmond', 'aaaa ents. inc. v. river place community urban redevelopment corp.', 'state v. ogletree', 'state v. xie', 'padilla v. kentucky', 'mcmann v. richardson', 'state v. cardenas', 'state v. galdamez', 'lee v. united states', 'hill v. lockhart', 'state v. romero', 'state v. kurdi']",[],[],0,0,0,
"A U.S. citizen sponsors his alien spouse for immigration by signing a USCIS Form I-864 Affidavit of Support. At the time, they have a minor child who is a U.S. citizen and was born before the affidavit was signed, and this child is not listed on the affidavit. The couple later separates, and the sponsored spouse seeks monetary damages from the sponsor for breach of the Affidavit of Support. When calculating the sponsor's obligation, what household size should the court use for the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) Guidelines, and if the spouse also loaned the sponsor money in a foreign currency, in what currency should the repayment be awarded?","The court erred by using the FPL Guidelines for a two-person household. The sponsor only promised to support the alien spouse in the Affidavit of Support, and the U.S. citizen child was not listed on the form as an immigrant intended to be sponsored, as the Affidavit of Support does not apply to U.S. citizens. Therefore, the court should calculate the damages using the FPL Guidelines for a one-person household. For example, for 2016, if the one-person FPL Guideline was $14,850 and the spouse's adjusted gross income was $8,511, the damages would be $6,339. The court did not err by deducting depreciation expenses from the spouse's adjusted gross income when calculating damages.

Regarding the loan, as the spouse loaned and paid the sponsor in Australian Dollars (AUD), the interest was repaid in AUD, and the spouse's loss occurred in AUD, the court erred by awarding equitable relief payable in U.S. Dollars (USD). On remand, the trial court must correct and convert the spouse's equitable award and any interest thereon to be repayable in AUD for any outstanding balance. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not crediting the sponsor with any purported ""sweat equity"" for repairing other properties. The trial court's award of reasonable attorney's fees to the spouse for claims of breach of the Affidavit of Support is affirmed, but the amount may be reconsidered upon remand.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['pelc v. pham', 'mckoy v. mckoy', 'suozzo v. suozzo', 'zhu v. deng', 'martin v. n.c. dept. of health & human servs.', 'anderson v. anderson', 'barnett v. barnett', 'erler v. erler erler i', 'wenfang liu v. mund', 'younis v. farooqi', 'flores v. flores', 'n.c. ins. guar. assn v. weathersfield mgmt.', 'erler v. erler erler ii', 'villars v. villars', 'tohato inc. v. pinewild mgmt.', 'state v. sharpe', 'weil v. herring', 'kinlaw v. harris', 'bartlett milling co. v. walnut grove auction & realty', 'm.v. eleftherotria v. owner of m.v. despina r', 'buncombe county ex rel andres v. newburn', 'gay v. walter', 'state v. quick', 'madar v. madar', 'iannuzzelli v. lovett']","[{'title': 'section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act', 'chunk': ""The case concerns an alien's removability under section 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

Failure to do so, by not providing documentation that aligns with or explains away conflicting record evidence, constitutes a failure to meet the burden of proof, leading the court to deny the motion without prejudice and potentially order supplemental briefing.","[('cfr', '8', '')]","['zhang v. united states citizenship and immigration services', 'huashan zhang v. u.s. citizenship & immigr. servs.', 'alyeska pipeline serv. co. v. wilderness socy', 'wash. all. of tech. workers v. u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'scarborough v. principi', 'ivy sports med. llc v. burwell', 'sosebee v. astrue', 'herman & maclean v. huddleston', 'haselwander v. mchugh', 'hirschey v. ferc', 'cobell v. norton', 'united states v.', 'natl assn of mfrs. v. dept of lab.', 'shooting star ranch llc v. united states', 'broaddus v. u.s. army corps of engineers']","[{'title': 'Equal Access to Justice Act', 'chunk': ""The court granted Giscard Nkenglefac's petition for review and awarded $56,169.79 in fees under the EAJA.

"An employer seeks an H-1B visa for a ""Vice President of Strategic Planning"" role, requiring a bachelor's degree in Business Administration or a closely related field.

"An asylum seeker, Mr. X, claims he fears torture if returned to his home country. He alleges that he was severely beaten and robbed by two uniformed police officers who forcibly entered his home, accusing him of a crime they knew he did not commit, and explicitly stated they were doing so because Mr. X had previously reported a corrupt local official. Mr. X states these officers were known for taking bribes and acting on personal vendettas, and that the government often claims such officers are ""rogue agents"" not acting officially. Will Mr. X's claim likely satisfy the ""official capacity"" requirement for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) regulations, based on the actions of these officers?","Yes, Mr. X's claim regarding the actions of the uniformed police officers will likely satisfy the ""official capacity"" requirement for protection under the CAT regulations. Under Department of Justice regulations implementing the CAT, an act constitutes ""torture"" only if it is inflicted or approved by a public official or other person ""acting in an official capacity,"" which means acting ""under color of law."" The ""under color of law"" standard is the *only* standard to apply; the concept of a distinct ""rogue official"" standard is rejected as risking confusion. The standard draws no categorical distinction between the acts of low- and high-level officials. An official acts ""under color of law"" when they exercise power possessed by virtue of law and made possible only because they were clothed with the authority of law. This often involves the misuse of authority, where an official uses their official authority to fulfill personal objectives. Therefore, even if the officers were motivated by personal vendettas or were considered ""corrupt, low-level agents,"" their actions would still be ""under color of law"" if they misused their power as police officers, clothed with the authority of law, to inflict the harm. The relevant question is whether they acted under color of law, not whether they were ""rogue"" in the sense of not serving the interests of the entire government.","[('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['ofas', 'west v. atkins', 'united states v. classic', 'garcia v. holder', 'united states v. belfast', 'ramirez-peyro v. holder', 'ali v. reno', 'marmorato v. holder', 'hernandez-torres v. lynch', 'rodriguez-molinero v. lynch', 'higueros v. holder', 'natl collegiate athletic assn v. tarkanian', 'martinez v. colon', 'bragdon v. abbott', 'lugar v. edmondson oil co.', 'almand v. dekalb cty.', 'edwards v. wallace cmty. coll.']",[],[],0,0,0,

The court affirmed that the plaintiff's I-360 Petition was properly denied under 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c) because he previously sought immediate relative status based on a marriage (to A-G-) determined to have been entered into for the purpose of evading immigration laws.

Furthermore, the BIA's decision not to require the government to file briefing does not establish bias, as regulations allow both parties to forgo filing briefs. Finally, the court rejected the argument that a single-member BIA panel decision, which cannot reverse an immigration judge's order unless plainly consistent with and required by an intervening change in law, violates due process.

"A lawful permanent resident seeking naturalization was convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, causing a loss of over $10,000. The sentencing for this offense was less than one year of imprisonment.

The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has expressly overruled the ""hybrid offense"" theory established in *Nugent v. Ashcroft*. An offense that ""involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000"" is an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) regardless of whether it also meets the requirements of any other subparagraph, such as the one-year imprisonment threshold for ""theft offenses"" under § 1101(a)(43)(G). Each subparagraph of § 1101(a)(43) lays out a separate aggravated felony, and there is no indication in the statute that an offense must satisfy multiple subparagraphs.

"A rancher whose property is near the U.S. southern border experienced significant damage, including lost cattle profits, depleted water, and trash, directly linked to a dramatic increase in illegal immigration following the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) decisions to halt border wall construction and terminate the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) without conducting environmental analyses. Does this rancher have legal standing to challenge DHS's actions, and would DHS be found in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)?","Yes, the rancher (Steven Smith) has standing to sue, and DHS would be found in violation of NEPA.
The Court found that Smith suffered concrete and particularized injuries, including lost profits from cattle that ingested trash, depleted water reserves due to migrants tying down float systems in water troughs, and trespass with detritus left behind by migrants. These harms are considered concrete ""monetary injury"" or bear a close relationship to harms traditionally recognized in American courts. His testimony about experiencing these injuries almost daily in the last three years, in contrast to a couple of times a month during the previous administration, was found credible.
Causation was established through an ""enticement theory"" with three links supported by a preponderance of the evidence:
1.  **Relaxed Policies:** DHS's decisions to halt border wall construction and terminate MPP relaxed deterrents and consequences for illegal immigration, reversing a 27-year proven border security strategy and effectively ""unsecuring the border almost overnight,"" according to expert testimony from former senior border officials.
2.  **Responsive Migrants:** Migrants reacted predictably to these relaxed policies, leading to a sharp uptick in illegal immigration, which overwhelmed Border Patrol resources nationwide and diverted manpower away from areas like the Tucson Sector, where Smith lives, thus increasing unpatrolled areas.
3.  **Related Harms:** This dramatic increase in illegal immigration directly led to the increased migrant traffic on Smith’s land, causing the damage to his property, water, and cattle.
The Court concluded that both the cessation of border wall construction and the rescission of MPP constituted ""major Federal actions"" under NEPA, requiring environmental analysis. DHS concededly failed to perform this analysis, thus acting ""without observance of procedure required by law"" in violation of NEPA.","[('usc', '6', ''), ('usc', '6', ''), ('usc', '6', '')]","['massachusetts coalition for immigration reform v. us citizenship and immigration services', 'transunion llc v. ramirez', 'fla. audubon socy v. bentsen', 'flores v. johnson', 'cannon v. district of columbia', 'defs. of wildlife inc. v. endangered species sci. auth.', 'ramirez v. u.s. immigr. & customs enft', 'new york v. u.s. dept of com.', 'lujan v. defs. of wildlife', 'rumsfeld v. forum for acad. & instl rts. inc.', 'friends of the earth inc. v. laidlaw envt servs. toc inc.', 'natl parks conserv. assn v. manson', 'united states v. richardson', 'spokeo inc. v. robbins', 'campbell v. natl union fire ins. co. of pittsburgh pa', 'entick v. carrington', 'grupo dataflux v. atlas glob. grp. l.p.', 'mollan v. torrance', 'simon v. e. ky. welfare rts. org.', 'natl wrestling coaches assn v. dept of educ.', 'trudeau v. ftc', 'block v. meese', 'bennett v. spear', 'massachusetts v. e.p.a.', 'competitive enter. inst. v. fcc', 'cei v. nhtsa', 'tozzi v. hhs', 'energy future coalition v. epa', 'new jersey v. epa', 'arpaio v. obama', 'murthy v. missouri']","[{'title': 'National Environmental Policy Act', 'chunk': 'The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires federal agencies to analyze environmental effects of major actions.'}]",[],0,0,0,
"An individual applies for an EB-5 visa, having invested capital in a new commercial enterprise. Their investment agreement includes a ""call option,"" which grants the company the choice to buy out the investor's interest at a specified price after certain conditions are met, but does not give the investor any right to demand repayment. USCIS denies the EB-5 petition, asserting that the call option means the investor's capital is not ""at risk"" and thus constitutes a prohibited debt arrangement. Is USCIS's denial likely to be upheld as consistent with federal law and prior agency decisions?","No, USCIS's denial based solely on the presence of a call option that does not grant the investor a right to demand repayment is unlikely to be upheld. The court found that USCIS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it declared investors ineligible for visas due to call options, concluding that such options do not provide investors with any right to repayment and therefore still place their capital at risk. The court distinguished a call option (a right held by the company) from a sell option (a right held by the investor, which *does* make capital not at risk), finding that USCIS's interpretation stretched the rationale of *Matter of Izummi* and conflicted with the plain language of the regulations.

"A U-visa applicant, whose application has been pending for over four years, files a lawsuit against USCIS alleging unreasonable delay in determining their eligibility for the U-visa waitlist and failure to issue interim employment authorization documents (EAD). The applicant cites a 2011 regulation mandating EAD adjudication within 90 days or the issuance of interim documents. The government moves to dismiss all claims, arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction under IIRIRA provisions (8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(g), 1252(a)(5), and 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)) and failure to state a claim, further contending that the 2011 EAD regulation was repealed in 2017 and therefore does not apply. How should the court rule on these claims?","The court should rule as follows:
1.  **Jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(g) and 1252(a)(5):** The court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint. These IIRIRA provisions do not apply because the plaintiff is not challenging the commencement, adjudication, or execution of a removal order, nor seeking review of a removal order. Instead, the claims challenge the government's delay in adjudicating U-visa waitlist eligibility and work authorization.
2.  **Unreasonable Delay in U-Visa Waitlist Eligibility (APA & Mandamus):**
    *   **Jurisdiction:** The court has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). Determining eligibility for the U-visa waitlist is a mandatory assessment, not a discretionary decision specified by statute, as 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(2) requires eligible petitioners to be placed on the waitlist.
    *   **Merits (Failure to State a Claim):** The plaintiff fails to state a claim for unreasonable delay. While the four-year delay is substantial and several ""TRAC test"" factors favor the plaintiff (e.g., sense of Congress for 180-day processing, human welfare interests, prejudice by delay), the D.C. Circuit precedent places significant weight on the ""competing priorities"" factor. A judicial order expediting this single application would merely shift the plaintiff ahead of thousands of other equally worthy applicants, creating more unfairness than it would remedy, and would interfere with the agency's resource allocation, which is a matter for the political branches.
3.  **Failure to Adjudicate EAD under 8 U.S.C. § 1184(p)(6) (APA & Mandamus):** The court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this claim. The statute explicitly states that ""The Secretary may grant work authorization,"" indicating a purely discretionary decision. Therefore, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) strips the court of jurisdiction to review the Secretary's handling of such discretionary EAD requests, and there is no clear duty to act required for APA or mandamus relief.
4.  **Failure to Issue Interim Work Authorization under 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) (2011) (APA & Mandamus):**
    *   **Applicable Regulation:** The 2011 version of 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) applies. It was in effect when the plaintiff filed their application in June 2016 and when the 90-day adjudication period expired in September 2016. Applying the later-effective 2017 repeal retroactively would strip the plaintiff of a vested right to interim work authorization, which is impermissible without express congressional authorization.
    *   **Jurisdiction:** The court has jurisdiction. The 2011 regulation's language (""USCIS will adjudicate... within 90 days... Failure to complete the adjudication within 90 days will result in the grant..."") creates a clear, mandatory duty for the agency to either adjudicate or issue interim EAD, making it a discrete agency action required to be taken under the APA. Judicial review is not precluded by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as that section applies only to statutory, not regulatory, discretion.
    *   **Merits (Stated a Claim):** The plaintiff has stated a claim for agency action unlawfully withheld. The plain language of the 2011 regulation requires adjudication or issuance of interim EAD within 90 days of receipt, which the agency failed to do. The agency's interpretation that the 90-day clock begins only after a threshold determination on an underlying benefit has no support in the regulation's text and is contradicted by the agency's own reasons for repealing the rule.
5.  **Challenge to Repeal of 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) (2011) without Notice-and-Comment:** This claim is dismissed. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendants' arguments in opposition, thereby conceding the issue. Furthermore, the complaint lacked factual allegations supporting the claim, and the Federal Register documentation shows that the agency followed proper notice-and-comment procedures for the repeal.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '1182'), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '1101'), ('usc', '8', '')]","['garcia uranga v. us citizenship & immigration services', 'sparrow v. united air lines inc.', 'schuler v. united states', 'am. natl ins. v. fdic', 'astakhov v. united states citizenship and immigration services', 'browning v. clinton', 'lujan v. defs. of wildlife', 'kokkonen v. guardian life ins. co. of am.', 'gen. motors corp. v. epa', 'united states v.', 'scolaro v. d.c. bd. of elections & ethics', 'herbert v. natl acad. of scis.', 'jerome stevens pharms. inc. v. fda', 'ashcroft v. iqbal', 'bell atl. corp. v. twombly', 'reno v. am.-arab anti-discrimination comm.', 'am. hosp. assn v. burwell', 'jay v. boyd', 'natl assn of mfrs. v. sec', 'a.c.c.s. v. nielsen', 'khan v. johnson', 'islam v. heinauer', 'mashpee wampanoag tribal council inc. v. norton', 'liberty fund inc. v. chao', 'landgraf v. usi film prods.', 'bowen v. georgetown univ. hosp.', 'perez v. mortg. bankers assn']","[{'title': 'U.S. Code Title 8 Section 1252', 'chunk': '(A) in the form of direct heat, steam, hot water, or other thermal form that is used in production and beneficial measures for heating, cooling, humidity control, process use, or other valid thermal end-use energy requirements; and'}, {'title': '8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D)', 'chunk': '8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D) permits judicial review of constitutional claims or questions of law in removal cases.

"An immigration advocacy group, similar to the American Immigration Council, seeks records from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding a program where CBP agents conducted credible fear interviews. The group specifically requested records related to training materials, supervision protocols, and grant/denial rates, but CBP only searched for a limited set of categories. USCIS and DHS withheld several documents, including drafts, issue papers, briefing memos, and an email containing names of CBP officers, citing deliberative process and personal privacy exemptions. The group challenges the adequacy of CBP's search and the agencies' withholdings. How would a federal court likely rule on these challenges based on the provided case precedent?","Based on the provided case precedent, a federal court would likely rule as follows:
1.  **CBP's Search:** The court would find CBP's search insufficient. CBP only searched for two out of seven requested categories, relying on the assertion that DHS and USCIS were the ""likely custodians"" for the others. The court found this justification inadequate, as CBP's role was not sufficiently limited to excuse it from searching other relevant categories, nor was the search description for the categories it *did* search adequately detailed. CBP would be ordered to conduct a more comprehensive search.
2.  **Exemption 5 (Deliberative Process) Withholdings by DHS and USCIS:** The court would likely find that DHS and USCIS did not adequately justify these withholdings. The agencies' descriptions of the documents (drafts, issue papers, briefing memos, meeting topics) and their role in a deliberative process were deemed too broad and conclusory, lacking specific detail on the decision or policy involved, the nature of the deliberation, or the specific foreseeable harm disclosure would cause. The agencies would be given an opportunity to supplement their Vaughn indices with more detailed justifications or release the documents, and in camera inspection would likely be ordered given the small number of documents.

"A plaintiff filed a lawsuit in the District of Columbia challenging the denial of an immigrant visa petition by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The petition was processed and denied at a USCIS service center located in the Northern District of Texas, and the plaintiff resides in Maryland. The government has moved to transfer the case to either the Northern District of Texas or the District of Maryland. In which district would venue be proper for this action, and should the case be transferred there?","Venue would be proper in the Northern District of Texas, and the case should be transferred there.
An action against the federal government can be brought in any judicial district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Here, the plaintiff's Form I-140 petition was processed and denied at USCIS’s Texas Service Center, located in the Northern District of Texas, meaning a substantial part of the events occurred there. The plaintiff's argument that the events in Texas were merely a byproduct of D.C. policy decisions is rejected because the claim focuses on the application of eligibility criteria to a specific petition in Texas, not a challenge to national policy from D.C.

The case should be transferred to the Northern District of Texas based on both public and private interests.
*   **Public Interests:** The controversy is local to the Northern District of Texas, where the petition was processed and denied. Courts routinely find that cases challenging immigration petition denials should be decided where the petition was processed. The familiarity of courts with federal law is neutral, and while the Northern District of Texas is marginally more congested than the D.C. court, it does not have such enormous backlogs to prevent transfer, especially given the strong local interest.
*   **Private Interests:** The government prefers the Northern District of Texas. The claim arose in that district. Convenience to the parties, witnesses, and evidence also favors the Northern District of Texas, as any relevant witnesses or documents are most likely located there. The plaintiff's choice to litigate in D.C. receives only minimal deference because the plaintiff does not reside in D.C. and the factual allegations lack a significant nexus to D.C. officials or their specific actions.

Therefore, considering all factors, the case should be transferred to the Northern District of Texas. The transferring court found it appropriate to transfer the case without fully resolving its own subject matter jurisdiction, leaving that question for the transferee court to determine.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['ike v. united states citizenship and immigration services', 'gyau v. sessions', 'van dusen v. barrack', 'ravulapalli v. napolitano', 'pasem v. uscis', 'bourdon v. dhs', 'ngonga v. sessions', 'trout unlimited v. u.s. dept of agric.', 'salha v. dhs', 'al-ahmed v. chertoff', 'greater yellowstone coal. v. bosworth', 'pub. citizen v. u.s. dist. court for d.c.', 'pac. mar. assn v. nlrb', 'diaz v. sessions', 'fine cuts inc. v. dhs', 'relx inc. v. baran']",[],[],0,0,0,
"Under U.S. immigration law, can a foreign-born child claim citizenship through a parent who never actually resided in the U.S., by arguing that the parent constructively satisfied statutory physical presence requirements for citizenship transmission, particularly when a foreign government's actions, rather than a U.S. government error, prevented actual physical presence?","No, the court affirmed that the constructive physical presence doctrine does not apply to transmit United States citizenship under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 in such circumstances. The Act's plain language provides only limited exceptions to physical presence requirements (for military service or government employment), and courts decline to read broader equitable exceptions into the statute. The precedent allowing constructive physical presence for transmission (*Matter of Navarrete*) is specifically limited to scenarios where a U.S. government error prevented compliance with the physical presence requirements. Since no U.S. government error caused the father's inability to reside in the U.S., the doctrine does not apply.

Did USCIS act improperly in this scenario?","Yes, USCIS acted improperly. The court ruled that when an I-140 petition is pending before USCIS and the agency receives notice that the beneficiary has requested to port to a new employer, USCIS acts inconsistently with the portability provision (8 U.S.C. § 1154(j)) if it continues to treat only the original employer as a party to the petition adjudication proceeding. Regulations preventing I-140 beneficiaries from being recognized as parties to petition proceedings and from appealing denials are deemed a ""mere nullity"" in this context because they conflict with the statutory scheme created by the portability provision. USCIS should have treated the I-140 beneficiary as a party, sent the Request for Evidence to the beneficiary, and permitted the beneficiary to appeal the denial.

"An alien from El Salvador seeks asylum and withholding of removal in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security presents an Interpol Red Notice indicating an active warrant for the alien's arrest in El Salvador for violating Article 345 of the Salvadoran Penal Code, which proscribes participation in an illicit organization whose purpose is the commission of crimes. The Red Notice also suggests the alien is a ""hit man"" for a gang. Can the Interpol Red Notice constitute sufficient evidence to trigger the serious nonpolitical crime bar, and how would the court assess the ""seriousness"" of such a crime for purposes of asylum and withholding eligibility?","Yes, an Interpol Red Notice may constitute reliable evidence indicating that the serious nonpolitical crime bar for asylum and withholding of removal applies to an alien. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can meet its burden to shift the burden of proof to the alien by presenting ""some evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that one or more grounds for mandatory denial of the application for relief may apply,"" which an Interpol Red Notice, corroborated by other evidence like a Form I-213, can satisfy. An Interpol Red Notice is considered reliable for what it purports to be: a request by a member country for provisional arrest based on a valid national arrest warrant for a serious ordinary law crime.

Once the burden shifts, the alien must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the serious nonpolitical crime bar does not apply.

The petition for review is denied in part with respect to the CAT claim.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['santos-zacaria v. garland', 'gomez-palacios v. holder', 'roy v. ashcroft', 'faddoul v. ins', 'padmore v. holder', 'rodriguez v. holder', 'aviles-tavera v. garland', 'bowen v. georgetown univ. hosp.', 'hammerschmidt v. garland', 'pullman-standard v. swint', 'rotinsulu v. mukasey', 'winfrey v. rogers', 'omagah v. ashcroft', 'osmani v. garland', 'nabulwala v. gonzalez', 'gonzalez-veliz v. barr', 'soadjede v. ashcroft', 'ins v. bagamasbad', 'qorane v. barr', 'motor vehicle mfrs. assn of u.s. inc. v. state farm mut. auto. ins.', 'hakim v. holder', 'sec v. chenery corp.']",[],[],0,0,0,
"An individual in removal proceedings, a native and citizen of Cameroon, seeks review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision. The BIA affirmed an immigration judge's (IJ) denial of a motion to continue removal proceedings to await adjudication of a relative's I-130 petition. Additionally, the BIA denied a motion to remand the case to the IJ after the I-130 petition was approved, so the individual could pursue adjustment of status. The IJ had previously denied the continuance motion for failure to show good cause, citing untimeliness and lack of diligence in pursuing the I-130 petition. Does the Court of Appeals have jurisdiction to review the BIA's affirmance of the continuance denial, and did the BIA abuse its discretion in denying the motion to remand?","The Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction to review the BIA's continuance determination because the ""good cause"" standard for a continuance, unlike an ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" standard, has discretion baked into it and does not involve a reviewable application of a legal standard under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D). Therefore, the petition for review regarding the continuance denial is dismissed. Regarding the motion to remand, the BIA did not abuse its discretion. It was ""perceptibl[y rational"" for the BIA to determine that the individual failed to show due diligence in pursuing adjustment of status through his daughter, as she filed her I-130 petition nearly a year after becoming eligible to do so, and counsel helped ""quickly put together"" the petition only after marital difficulties arose. Therefore, the petition for review regarding the denial of the motion to remand is denied.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['ikome v. bondi', 'green valley special util. dist. v. city of schertz', 'patel v. garland', 'wilkinson v. garland', 'cuenca-arroyo v. garland', 'manzano-garcia v. gonzales', 'steel co. v. citizens for a better envt', 'guerrero-lasprilla v. barr', 'united states v. swanson', 'perez v. garland', 'milat v. holder', 'zhao v. gonzales', 'suate-orellana v. barr']",[],[],0,0,0,
"An alien was apprehended after illegal entry and provided an address to immigration officials. The address was deficient, leading to returned mail and the alien's in absentia removal. Eighteen years later, the alien moves to reopen removal proceedings, asserting that a different, correct address was initially provided and that the immigration officer made an error, thus entitling the alien to notice. The alien further argues that the original Notice to Appear (NTA) was defective for failing to specify the date and time of the hearing, making them eligible for cancellation of removal, particularly in light of subsequent Supreme Court precedent that clarified the ""stop-time rule."" How should a court rule on the alien's motion to reopen and claim of eligibility for cancellation of removal?","The court would deny the petition for review. Regarding the motion to reopen removal proceedings and rescind the in absentia removal order, the immigration judge (IJ) rejected the alien's affidavit testimony as untrustworthy and found that the alien provided a deficient address. Substantial evidence supports this factual finding, meaning the alien failed to provide an address at which they could be contacted, thus forfeiting their right to notice. An alien who forfeits their right to notice by failing to provide a viable mailing address cannot seek to reopen the removal proceedings and rescind the in absentia removal order for lack of notice. Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in affirming the IJ's decision. Regarding the alien's claim of eligibility for cancellation of removal, the alien failed to analyze this theory in a meaningful way in their opening brief, and thus the argument is forfeited. It is of no consequence that then-valid circuit precedent foreclosed the cancellation argument at the time the opening brief was submitted, as the argument was nonetheless available to the alien.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['spagnol-bastos v. garland', 'mauricio-benitez v. sessions', 'hernandez-castillo v. sessions', 'gomez-palacios v. holder', 'pereira v. sessions', 'niz-chavez v. garland', 'rodriguez v. garland', 'edwards v. johnson', 'perez-sanchez v. u.s. atty gen.', 'ortiz-santiago v. barr']",[],[],0,0,0,
