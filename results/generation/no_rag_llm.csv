"An individual in removal proceedings had their application for asylum and other relief denied due to failure to submit biometrics, despite being previously instructed by the Immigration Judge while pro se. They subsequently retained counsel, who also failed to advise them about the biometrics requirement. After the denial, and more than 90 days after the final order of removal, they filed a motion to reopen, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel prevented a merits hearing and that this justified equitable tolling of the filing deadline. They also requested *sua sponte* reopening by the Board of Immigration Appeals. Could this individual successfully overturn the denial of their motion to reopen based on equitable tolling due to counsel's ineffectiveness or compel the BIA to *sua sponte* reopen their case?","No, the individual could not successfully overturn the denial of their motion to reopen based on equitable tolling or compel the BIA to *sua sponte* reopen their case. The court found that even if counsel's failure to remind about biometrics was ineffective, there was no argument that counsel's ineffectiveness caused the motion to reopen itself to be untimely filed. The failure to move in a timely fashion to reopen was an independent basis for denying relief, and the individual failed to show any basis for equitable tolling of the filing deadline for reopening. Additionally, the court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA's discretionary decision not to invoke its *sua sponte* authority to reopen a case.",,,,,,,
"An organization, ""Global Solutions Institute,"" seeks an H-1B visa cap exemption as a ""nonprofit research organization."" USCIS denies the petition, interpreting ""primarily engaged in basic research and/or applied research"" to mean ""directly and principally engaged in research,"" and finds Global Solutions Institute's evidence insufficient to meet this standard. Global Solutions Institute challenges this denial under the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing that USCIS misinterpreted its regulation, its decision lacked factual support, and it failed to explain its departure from prior approvals of similar petitions. Based on the provided case, how would a U.S. federal court likely rule on Global Solutions Institute's challenge?","A U.S. federal court would likely rule in favor of USCIS, upholding the denial of the H-1B visa cap exemption. The court in the analogous case found USCIS's interpretation of ""primarily engaged in basic research and/or applied research"" as meaning ""directly and principally engaged in research"" to be unambiguously correct, aligning with dictionary definitions, statutory text, and regulatory history. The court would likely defer to the agency's factual assessment, finding that USCIS's conclusion that the organization failed to meet its evidentiary burden was fair and reasonable, considering the evidence in proportion to its other activities. Finally, regarding prior approvals, the court would likely find that an agency is permitted to change its position, and USCIS adequately explained its decision by acknowledging prior approvals and providing a detailed, reasoned analysis of the current petition based on the record, which is sufficient under the Administrative Procedure Act.",,,,,,,
"A group of international students had their F-1 visas terminated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after discovering they were ""enrolled"" in a sham university created by DHS as part of a sting operation. The termination letter stated their SEVIS record and Form I-20 had been set to ""Terminated due to your fraudulent enrollment."" The students filed a federal lawsuit challenging the termination, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and Due Process, and seeking an order prohibiting the Government from finding they committed fraud. The District Court dismissed the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding the DHS action was not final because reinstatement proceedings were pending and the case was not ripe for review. The students appealed. If these students were to proceed with their appeal, would the appellate court likely find that the DHS's termination of their F-1 visas constitutes a final agency action ripe for judicial review under the APA?","Yes, the appellate court would likely find that DHS's termination of the F-1 visas constitutes a final agency action ripe for judicial review under the APA. The termination order marked the consummation of the agency's decision-making process by stripping the students of their lawful status and placing a fraud notation on their records, thus determining a ""right or obligation.""

The court would disagree with the District Court's conclusions regarding finality and ripeness for two main reasons:
1.  **Finality of Agency Action:**
    *   **Reinstatement Proceedings Are Not a Prerequisite for Review:** There is no statutory or regulatory requirement for students to seek reinstatement after F-1 visa termination. Moreover, reinstatement proceedings do not provide a mechanism to review the propriety of the original termination order or the ""fraudulent enrollment"" decision. Even if reinstatement is granted, it does not ""wipe away"" the prior agency decision.
    *   **Removal Proceedings Are Not a Prerequisite for Review:** The finality of an order cannot be conditioned on potential, uninitiated removal proceedings, which may never occur. Furthermore, neither immigration judges nor the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) have the authority to review the USCIS's discretionary denial of a motion to reinstate student status or to overturn the initial termination decision. Therefore, removal proceedings do not offer an opportunity to contest the agency action. The termination is the culmination, not the initiation, of the agency's decision-making process.
2.  **Ripeness for Review:**
    *   The case is ripe because the parties are in a sufficiently adversarial posture, and the students are genuinely aggrieved by the termination of their lawful status and the permanent ""fraud"" notation on their records. The government's shifting position on whether the students were victims or participants in the fraud further underscores the need for judicial review that would otherwise be absent. Ongoing reinstatement proceedings do not render the case unripe because they do not provide an avenue to review ICE's termination decision.",,,,,,,
"My petition for cancellation of removal was denied because the immigration judge found that the hardship my deportation would cause my American-citizen child was not ""exceptional and extremely unusual."" Can I successfully appeal this decision by arguing the judge applied the wrong legal standard or failed to adequately consider the dangerous conditions in my home country and the emotional impact on my son?","No, a federal court of appeals would likely deny your petition for review if the immigration judge (IJ) stated the correct ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" standard. The court would review whether the correct legal standard was applied de novo and factual findings for substantial evidence. Simply arguing that the IJ did not consider or give sufficient weight to certain facts, such as dangerous conditions in your home country or the emotional and psychological peril to your son, would likely be seen as a challenge to the factual findings. Such a challenge would only succeed if the evidence compels a contrary result, meaning your family would suffer hardship above and beyond that regularly faced by families who are separated, which the court found was not established in a similar case.",,,,,,,
"Can a federal district court compel the immediate deportation of an alien who is currently incarcerated for first-degree murder and other serious felonies, despite a prior removal order?","No, a federal district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to compel the immediate deportation of an alien who is currently incarcerated for criminal offenses, such as first-degree murder, because the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) explicitly divests the court of such jurisdiction. The INA states that no court shall have jurisdiction over claims by aliens arising from removal order execution and that the Attorney General may not remove an alien sentenced to imprisonment until released from imprisonment. Furthermore, no claim can be asserted under the INA to compel the release or removal of an alien. Therefore, the extraordinary remedy of a writ of mandamus is unavailable as there is no clear and indisputable right to the requested relief.",,,,,,,
"Does 8 U.S.C. § 1421(c), which provides for judicial review of naturalization denials, preclude federal district court jurisdiction over separate Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and constitutional challenges to a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) policy underlying such denials?","Yes, 8 U.S.C. § 1421(c) precludes federal district court jurisdiction over separate APA and constitutional challenges to a USCIS policy underlying the denial of naturalization applications. Congress intended § 1421(c) to be the exclusive means for seeking judicial review of naturalization application denials, and this includes claims challenging the rationale underlying those denials, even if embodied in a ""policy."" The legislative history of the 1990 Act, which created the administrative naturalization system, indicates an intent to streamline the process while ensuring plenary judicial review through § 1421(c). The plaintiffs' claims are not ""wholly collateral"" but are ""inextricably intertwined"" with their naturalization denials, as they are ""at bottom"" an attempt to reverse the agency’s decisions denying their claims. Furthermore, § 1421(c) provides an ""adequate remedy"" because it allows for broad judicial review, including de novo review, the court making its own findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the full scope of APA review under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), including constitutional claims and challenges to agency action as arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.",,,,,,,
"Under what circumstances might a U.S. federal court find that the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying an H-1B visa petition for a computer systems analyst position, specifically concerning the determination of whether the position qualifies as a ""specialty occupation"" based on the normal minimum degree requirement and industry common practice?","A U.S. federal court found that USCIS acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying an H-1B visa petition for a computer systems analyst position by disregarding or failing to explain why it discounted substantial evidence in the administrative record. Specifically, the court found fault with USCIS's analysis regarding two criteria for a specialty occupation under 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A): (1) whether a baccalaureate or higher degree or its equivalent is normally the minimum requirement for entry into the particular position, and (2) whether the degree requirement is common to the industry in parallel positions among similar organizations. The court concluded that USCIS misinterpreted or misapplied the law by effectively holding the plaintiff to a higher standard (requiring a degree ""always"" instead of ""normally"") when evaluating the Occupational Outlook Handbook, and by providing insufficient reasoning for dismissing comparator job postings. The case was remanded to USCIS for further consideration consistent with the court's opinion.",,,,,,,
"Can proceeds from a loan be classified as ""cash"" under 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e) for an EB-5 immigrant investor visa, or must they be considered ""indebtedness"" subject to collateralization requirements?","Proceeds from a loan can be classified as ""cash"" under 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e) for an EB-5 immigrant investor visa. The court ruled that USCIS's interpretation, which categorizes loan proceeds as ""indebtedness"" requiring collateralization, is plainly erroneous because it conflicts with the language and history of the regulation and USCIS's own precedent. The court stated that ""Cash—even if obtained from a loan—is still cash,"" and that ""indebtedness"" refers to the condition of owing money, typically when an investor promises to pay the new commercial enterprise later, rather than the immediate payment of cash.",,,,,,,
"An agency receives a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for ""records of guidelines, procedures, protocols, or policies"" related to specific practices of its regional courts and judges, such as scheduling hearings and adjudicating motions for continuance. The agency interprets the request as limited to official and centrally disseminated policies issued by its chief judicial office, and conducts searches only within that office and its public-facing intranet, finding only a few documents. The requester argues that the search is inadequate because it failed to include local operating procedures or policies that might be established and held by assistant chief judges or individual courts. How should a court rule on the agency's interpretation of the request and the adequacy of its search?","A court would rule that the agency properly interpreted the request as seeking only official policy documents, as the terms ""guidelines, procedures, protocols, or policies"" by their nature refer to official documents. However, the court would find that the agency improperly narrowed the scope of the request by limiting its search solely to centrally disseminated records from the chief judicial office. The agency's search of the chief judicial office and its intranet site was adequate for centrally disseminated records. Nonetheless, the search was inadequate because the agency failed to search repositories likely to contain local operating procedures or policies, specifically the email accounts of Assistant Chief Immigration Judges (ACIJs) and shared drives where individual immigration courts might store standing orders, given that individual immigration courts have the authority to establish their own local operating procedures. The agency was correct in declining to search for records related to the implementation of a proposed rule that had not yet become final, as that part of the request was too vague. The agency properly applied FOIA Exemption 6 and satisfied its segregability obligations.",,,,,,,
"An individual received a Notice to Appear (NTA) for removal proceedings that omitted the specific date and time of the hearing. Subsequently, they received a separate Notice of Hearing (NOH) via regular mail that included all the necessary hearing details. They failed to appear and an in absentia removal order was issued. Fifteen years later, the individual moved to rescind the order and reopen proceedings, claiming non-receipt of both notices and arguing the initial NTA was jurisdictionally defective. They submitted an affidavit attesting to non-receipt. They also requested the immigration judge exercise sua sponte authority to reopen the case.

Based on the provided Fifth Circuit decision, what is the likely outcome of their appeal regarding the rescission of the in absentia order and the denial of the motion to reopen?","The appeal would likely be denied in part and dismissed in part.
1.  **Jurisdiction:** The statutorily deficient NTA, which initially lacked the hearing date and time, did not deprive the immigration judge of jurisdiction to conduct the removal proceedings, as the regulation governing NTAs is a claim-processing rule, not a jurisdictional one.
2.  **Validity of In Absentia Order:** The subsequent NOH, which provided the date and time for the missed hearing, cured any defects in the initial NTA, rendering the in absentia removal order valid under the precedent set by *Campos-Chaves*.
3.  **Rebutting Presumption of Delivery:** While the NOH was sent via regular mail, triggering a weaker presumption of delivery, the individual's affidavit alone was not sufficient to rebut this presumption. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) would consider the totality of the circumstances, including the absence of any indication that the notices were returned as undeliverable and the individual's lack of due diligence, when determining that the presumption of delivery was not overcome.
4.  **Sua Sponte Reopening:** A federal court of appeals lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA’s decision not to exercise its discretion to reopen proceedings sua sponte.",,,,,,,
"A non-citizen defendant, whose native language is not English, entered a guilty plea to a first-degree misdemeanor assault charge without an interpreter present at the plea hearing. The defendant never requested an interpreter, and the trial court did not appoint one, though an earlier arraignment entry was stamped ""Order Interpreter – Swahili"" for unknown reasons. During the plea, the trial court read the defendant a form advising of potential immigration consequences (deportation, exclusion, denial of naturalization), and the defendant indicated understanding. Subsequently, the defendant filed a post-sentence motion to withdraw the guilty plea, arguing that a limited understanding of English prevented a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary plea, and that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to adequately advise on the immigration consequences of an assault conviction. The defendant claimed that if properly advised, they would have gone to trial. Should the trial court grant the motion to withdraw the guilty plea?","No, the trial court should deny the motion to withdraw the guilty plea. The defendant's claim of a language barrier preventing a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary plea lacks merit, as the regularity of the plea hearing (where no interpreter was requested or appointed) is presumed due to the absence of a transcript. Additionally, testimony from the defendant's former counsel and probation officer, along with previous trial testimony given by the defendant without an interpreter, demonstrated a sufficient ability to understand and communicate in English at the time of the plea. Regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, the deportation consequence of a first-degree misdemeanor assault conviction is not ""truly clear"" under federal immigration law (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)), as assault ""may or may not involve moral turpitude."" Therefore, counsel was only required to advise the defendant that pleading guilty to assault might carry a risk of adverse immigration consequences. Since counsel's testimony, which the trial court found credible, indicated that she discussed the immigration consequences listed in the plea form with the defendant, her performance was not deficient. As such, no manifest injustice occurred to warrant withdrawing the guilty plea.",,,,,,,
"A software services company, ""GlobalTech Solutions,"" had its H-1B visa petition for a ""Senior Software Engineer"" denied by USCIS on the grounds that it failed to demonstrate the position was a ""specialty occupation"" and did not provide sufficient details on job duties. GlobalTech now seeks to intervene in an ongoing lawsuit filed by another company, ""Innovate Systems,"" whose H-1B petition for a ""Project Manager IT"" was also denied by USCIS for similar reasons (failure to prove specialty occupation and employment relationship). GlobalTech argues that both cases involve common questions of law under the APA regarding USCIS's arbitrary and capricious denials. Should the court grant GlobalTech Solutions' motion for permissive intervention under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b)?","No, the court should deny GlobalTech Solutions' motion for permissive intervention. Intervention would be inappropriate because it would result in undue delay and the two companies' cases are factually distinct. USCIS's review of H-1B visa petitions is fact-intensive and courts' review is limited to the administrative record. The two companies' petitions would not share a single piece of evidence in common, and the job positions, while broadly involving computer technology, would have significantly varying specific functional responsibilities (e.g., ""Senior Software Engineer"" versus ""Project Manager IT""). Furthermore, Innovate Systems' case likely involves an additional legal question (proving an employer-employee relationship) not present in GlobalTech's case, which could prove dispositive and adds complexity. Given these distinct factual and legal natures, reviewing separate agency decisions and records would inject unnecessary complexity and delay into the existing case. The desire of counsel to coordinate a litigation strategy does not constitute a practical purpose that justifies intervention and would conflict with local rules for random case assignment.",,,,,,,
"A U.S. federal agency, seeking to withhold internal communications under the Freedom of Information Act's Exemption 5, claims that disclosing these documents would ""discourage the expression of candid opinions and inhibit the free and frank exchange of information among agency personnel,"" and ""could adversely impact the free flow of advice and information and could chill interactions and communications between agency employees and their legal counsel."" The agency's declaration and Vaughn index use these phrases uniformly for various documents, without providing specific details linking the asserted harm to the particular information in each withheld record. Will a federal court likely uphold the agency's withholdings based on these justifications?","No, a federal court will likely not uphold the agency's withholdings based on these justifications. The court in *Doe v. United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement* found similar ""boilerplate"" and ""generic assertions"" insufficient to meet the burden of showing a reasonably foreseeable harm from disclosure. For deliberative-process privilege claims, the agency must provide a ""focused and concrete demonstration"" of how disclosure of the *particular type of material at issue* would, in the *specific context of the agency action*, actually impede future agency deliberations. For attorney-client privilege claims, merely asserting that disclosure would chill future communications, without articulating the nature of the harm and linking it to specific information, is insufficient. The court would likely deny summary judgment and require the agency to provide a more detailed declaration or updated Vaughn index with specific, non-conclusory explanations of foreseeable harm for each withheld document.",,,,,,,
"After being convicted of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud and ordered to pay over $200,000 in restitution, an individual is found removable as an aggravated felon. If this individual, while detained and proceeding pro se, files a petition for review of the BIA's order 31 days after it was mailed, can they successfully challenge the use of the restitution amount to establish the aggravated felony, or argue ineffective assistance of counsel in their immigration proceedings?","No, the individual in this situation would likely not successfully challenge the use of the restitution amount to establish the aggravated felony, nor could they argue ineffective assistance of counsel in their immigration proceedings if not properly raised before the BIA.

Firstly, the court would likely have jurisdiction to hear the petition for review, despite it being received 31 days after the BIA order was mailed, because the ""prison mailbox rule"" (Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 25(a)(2)(A)(iii)) applies to pro se detainees in immigration proceedings. This rule deems a filing timely if it is deposited in the institution's internal mail system on or before the last day for filing, with a compliant certificate of service or evidence of deposit.

Secondly, regarding the aggravated felony determination, a restitution order tied to a fraud conspiracy conviction, clearly showing a loss to victims exceeding $10,000, provides clear and convincing evidence to establish that the conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M). The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) is permitted to rely on such sentencing-related material to determine the amount of loss, and the individual's restitution order for $229,717.30 linked to their conviction would be sufficient evidence.

Finally, any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel concerning immigration proceedings cannot be considered by the court if the individual failed to first raise it before the BIA on direct appeal or in a motion to reopen. Failure to exhaust an issue before the BIA is a jurisdictional bar for the appellate court. Additionally, other unreasoned and unsupported claims would likely be considered abandoned.",,,,,,,
"Can a federal district court exercise subject-matter jurisdiction over an Administrative Procedure Act challenge to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services' denial of jurisdiction over an alien's adjustment-of-status application, when the alien is subject to an outstanding order of removal?","No, a federal district court cannot exercise subject-matter jurisdiction over an Administrative Procedure Act (APA) challenge to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services' (USCIS) denial of jurisdiction over an alien's adjustment-of-status application when the alien is subject to an outstanding order of removal. Such an action functionally constitutes an ""indirect"" challenge to a pending removal order. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5), the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal is a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals, precluding judicial review under the APA. As the immigration court, specifically the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), retained exclusive jurisdiction over adjustment-of-status applications for aliens in ongoing deportation/removal proceedings, the USCIS correctly denied jurisdiction, and the challenge to that denial is barred.",,,,,,,
"A noncitizen worker's I-140 immigrant work visa petition was revoked by USCIS thirteen years after its approval, despite the worker having activated the ""job portability"" provision by changing employers after 180 days of their I-485 application pending. Subsequently, the worker's I-765 application for employment authorization was denied. Can a federal court review these agency actions?","No, a federal court cannot review either action. The revocation of the I-140 immigrant work visa petition under 8 U.S.C. § 1155 is committed to the unreviewable discretion of the executive branch, and courts lack jurisdiction to consider such revocations. The portability provision in 8 U.S.C. § 1154(j) does not strip the Secretary of Homeland Security of this revocation authority, as it applies to a petition's validity with respect to a *new* job, not to a petition that was determined to be invalid from its inception. Similarly, the denial of the I-765 application for employment authorization is committed to the discretion of USCIS by law under 8 C.F.R. § 274a.12(c) and 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(a)(1), and is therefore unreviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because there are no judicially manageable standards against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.",,,,,,,
"An H-1B visa applicant, whose petition was denied by USCIS based on a requirement that the employer prove specific, non-speculative work assignments for the entire visa duration, seeks a preliminary injunction. This denial occurred before a recent federal court decision invalidated that very USCIS policy. What action might a U.S. District Court take regarding the applicant's H-1B petition and immigration status in this situation?","The U.S. District Court granted the preliminary injunction in part for the H-1B applicant, Mr. Venkatraman. The court found a strong likelihood of success on the merits because USCIS's denial of his H-1B petition was clearly influenced by, and based on, the invalid ""non-speculative work requirement"" for the entire visa duration, as established by the intervening *Itserve Alliance, Inc. v. Cissna* decision. The court also determined there was a likelihood of irreparable harm due to the applicant's loss of lawful immigration status and the impending 180-day deadline, which would trigger a three-year bar on readmissibility to the U.S. Consequently, the court stayed USCIS's decision denying Mr. Venkatraman's petition, making the stay retroactive to February 14, 2020, to prevent the accrual of unlawful presence and ensure he retained lawful immigration status. Furthermore, the court vacated USCIS's denial decision and remanded the petition to the agency, ordering USCIS to reconsider it within sixty days in light of the *Itserve Alliance* ruling, without expressing an opinion on the ultimate merits of the petition.",,,,,,,
"A Christian leader from El Salvador, Samuel Argueta-Hernandez, was repeatedly threatened by MS-13 gang members after he refused to pay extortion and collaborate with them, with later threats explicitly mentioning his religious leadership. An assassin attempted to kill his son, and Salvadoran authorities, while acknowledging his danger, told him they could not protect him and even asked him to sign a liability waiver if he remained in the country. If the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denies his applications for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), stating that the harm was not severe enough due to lack of physical injury, that the nexus to his religion was insufficient as the gang's primary motive was extortion, and that the government's temporary safe house and facilitated departure demonstrated a willingness to protect him, how should a U.S. Court of Appeals review this decision?","The U.S. Court of Appeals should grant the petition for review, reverse the BIA's decision, and remand for further proceedings. The BIA misapplied prevailing case law by effectively requiring physical harm to establish persecution and by disregarding credible death threats and the attempt to kill the petitioner's son. It also erred in its nexus analysis by treating motive as an ""either-or"" proposition, failing to consider mixed motives (such as extortion coexisting with religious persecution) and one of the proposed particular social groups (Salvadoran informants against gang members). For the CAT claim, the BIA disregarded crucial evidence and failed to adequately support its decision that the Salvadoran government was willing and able to protect the petitioner, incorrectly interpreting temporary accommodation and facilitated departure as evidence of protection when authorities explicitly stated they could not ensure his safety and sought a liability waiver.",,,,,,,
Can a U.S. federal court compel USCIS to reverse its discretionary denial of an employment authorization application (Form I-765) and approve it during the pendency of judicial review?,"No, a U.S. federal court cannot compel USCIS to reverse its discretionary denial of an employment authorization application (Form I-765) and approve it during the pendency of judicial review. The denial of an I-765 application is committed to the discretion of USCIS by law, making it unreviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because there are no judicially manageable standards in the relevant statutes or regulations against which to judge USCIS's exercise of discretion. Furthermore, a request to reverse the denial and approve authorization is a mandatory injunction, which is an extraordinary remedy requiring a clear likelihood of success on the merits, a standard the plaintiff failed to meet. The court also cannot compel agency action (like reopening an I-765) under APA § 706(1) unless it's a discrete, ministerial, and non-discretionary duty, which is not the case for I-765 applications. Even if the I-765 denial were reviewable and erroneous, the error would be harmless as the plaintiff currently lacks a pending I-485 application, which is a prerequisite for I-765 approval.",,,,,,,
"Under what circumstances does a U.S. Court of Appeals lack jurisdiction to review a Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision to deny cancellation of removal, and what procedural requirements must an alien meet to challenge BIA procedural errors on appeal?","The U.S. Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction to review a BIA's purely discretionary decision to deny cancellation of removal, even if the alien is statutorily eligible, because Congress expressly stripped jurisdiction over ""any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section . . . 1229b"" by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). This jurisdictional strip applies unless the appeal involves reviewable constitutional claims or questions of law, which standardless discretionary decisions do not meet. Furthermore, the court lacks jurisdiction over claims of BIA procedural errors, such as an ultra vires act by a temporary board member, if the alien failed to exhaust all administrative remedies available as of right, specifically by not raising the issue in a motion to reconsider before the BIA. Lastly, if an alien appeals a BIA denial of a motion for reconsideration but forfeits essential arguments on appeal by not asserting them in their briefs, the court will dismiss the petition as any ruling on the preserved argument would be advisory.",,,,,,,
"A public interest legal organization requests that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) make all of its non-precedential, unpublished opinions publicly available in an electronic format, arguing that FOIA's affirmative disclosure obligations require it.

Can a U.S. federal court compel the BIA to make these documents publicly available online, rather than just producing them to the organization?","Yes, a U.S. federal court can compel the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) to make its non-precedential, unpublished opinions publicly available online. The Freedom of Information Act's (FOIA) remedial provision, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B), authorizes district courts to order injunctive relief that enforces agencies' affirmative disclosure obligations under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2), including the duty to make certain documents publicly available for inspection in an electronic format. This power is not limited to merely ordering the production of records to the individual complainant.",,,,,,,
"In a class action lawsuit against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) concerning its compliance with statutory obligations for the placement of young adults transitioning from unaccompanied alien children custody, a party seeks to introduce expert testimony from a statistician, a former agency administrator, and a pediatrician. What is the likelihood that the court will allow each expert to testify regarding the agency's compliance and the impact of its practices, based on similar expert challenges?","The court is likely to rule as follows:
1.  **Statistician (Qing Pan and Joseph Gastwirth)**: The court will deny a motion to exclude *certain opinions* of statisticians, allowing them to testify primarily on statistical methodology and data analysis. However, the court will caution that testimony not based on reliable statistical methods or straying into improper legal conclusions regarding ICE's statutory compliance will be given little weight. The court notes that it will entertain objections at trial.
2.  **Former Agency Administrator (Gary Mead)**: The court will grant a motion to exclude the testimony of a former agency administrator. The court finds that such testimony, which consists nearly entirely of legal conclusions about whether ICE is following the requirements of the statute, is inappropriate as expert testimony because it addresses the ultimate question before the court and would not assist the factfinder.
3.  **Pediatrician (Dr. Julie Linton)**: The court will deny a motion to exclude the testimony of a pediatrician. While her testimony on the physical and mental health-related effects of adult detention on immigrant teenagers may not touch on the central merits issues of statutory compliance, it is deemed relevant to the critical questions of remedies, specifically the four-factor test for injunctive relief (irreparable injury, adequacy of legal remedy, balance of hardships, and public interest).",,,,,,,
"Can an immigrant investor successfully sue U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for unreasonable delay in adjudicating their Form I-526 petition under the Administrative Procedure Act or the Mandamus Act, given that the petition has been pending for approximately three to four years, the agency employs a visa availability and first-in, first-out processing method, and there is no binding statutory timetable for adjudication?","No, an immigrant investor cannot successfully sue USCIS for unreasonable delay under these circumstances. The court found that the TRAC factors, used to evaluate the reasonableness of agency delay, favored the defendants. Specifically:
1.  **Rule of Reason:** USCIS's ""visa availability"" and ""first-in, first-out"" processing method is a ""rule of reason"" and ""identifiable rationale"" that prioritizes applicants for whom visas are available, which courts in this District have consistently found reasonable. A three to four-year delay, while significant, falls within the range of what courts have deemed reasonable for immigration petitions in the absence of specific congressional guidance.
2.  **Statutory Timetable:** Congress has not imposed a binding statutory timetable for adjudicating Form I-526 petitions. The ""sense of Congress"" language regarding a 180-day processing goal is precatory, not mandatory.
3.  **Higher/Competing Priority:** Expediting the plaintiff's petition would reorder agency priorities and undermine USCIS's allocation of resources by moving the plaintiff ahead of other similarly situated applicants, which courts generally disfavor.
4.  **Human Health and Welfare/Interests Prejudiced:** The plaintiff's asserted hardships, such as an uncertain future or inability to obtain employment, are primarily economic and personal difficulties inherent to the application process, not the kind of serious health and welfare interests typically addressed by these factors.
5.  **Impropriety:** The plaintiff failed to plausibly plead any factual claims of impropriety, offering only conclusory allegations.",,,,,,,
"Can a federal court exercise subject matter jurisdiction to halt the removal of an immigrant with a valid removal order who claims a ""regulatory right"" to remain in the United States while their application for a provisional unlawful presence waiver is pending?","No, federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to interfere with the execution of valid removal orders based on claims that pending provisional unlawful presence waiver applications create a ""regulatory right"" to remain in the United States. This is due to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), which strips federal courts of jurisdiction over ""any cause or claim"" by an alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to execute removal orders, making no exception for challenges to the government's underlying ""authority"" to execute such orders.",,,,,,,
"An alien ordered removed in absentia seeks to reopen their removal proceedings, arguing that the immigration court lacked jurisdiction because the Notice to Appear (NTA) was not filed, that the Board of Immigration Appeals improperly relied on a reconstructed record containing a Form I-213 instead of the NTA to prove notice, and that their due process rights were violated due to lack of written notice of the hearing. Should the federal appellate court grant the petition to review and reverse the denial of the motion to reopen?","No, the federal appellate court should deny the petition for review. The court found that the regulation concerning NTA filing (8 C.F.R. § 1003.14(a)) is a claim-processing rule, not jurisdictional, thus rejecting the jurisdictional challenge. The court also affirmed the BIA's reliance on the Form I-213 from the reconstructed record, deeming it an ""inherently trustworthy"" and admissible document that could establish the alien's deportability and that he received notice of his removal hearing, especially since no evidence suggested it was incorrect or obtained by coercion. Furthermore, the court concluded that the alien failed to present compelling evidence sufficient to reverse the BIA's finding that he received notice and an interpreter, thereby not demonstrating that his in absentia removal order should be rescinded for lack of notice under 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1)(G)(i) and § 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii). Finally, the court dismissed the due process claims, stating there is no liberty interest in the discretionary denial of a motion to reopen, and that the alien failed to show substantial prejudice regarding his purported failure to receive notice, as the BIA properly relied on the Form I-213.",,,,,,,
"An immigrant was given a Notice to Appear (NTA) that did not specify the date or time of their removal hearing. After release, they signed a form with a mailing address containing a single-letter typo in the city name. A later hearing notice, sent to this misspelled address, was returned undeliverable, leading to an *in absentia* removal order. Can the immigrant successfully argue to rescind the *in absentia* removal order and reopen proceedings, claiming they did not receive proper notice and that the original NTA was defective for lacking the hearing details?","No, the immigrant cannot successfully argue to rescind the *in absentia* removal order and reopen proceedings under these circumstances. The court concluded that the Petitioner forfeited his right to notice by failing to keep the immigration court apprised of his correct mailing address or to correct the erroneous address. The Petitioner signed forms (the ""Notification Requirement for Change of Address"" and Form I-830) containing the one-letter error in the city name and was obligated to correct it, even if an immigration officer initially caused the error. The court clarified that precedents like *Spagnol-Bastos v. Garland*, *Gudiel-Villatoro v. Garland*, and *Platero-Rosales v. Garland* govern this case, establishing that an alien who fails to provide a viable mailing address or correct an erroneous address forfeits their right to notice under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(5)(B). This forfeiture applies regardless of whether the original Notice to Appear (NTA) included the hearing time and place, making cases like *Rodriguez v. Garland* (which generally requires a single-document NTA with all details) inapplicable when notice is forfeited due to an address error. Therefore, the petition for review was denied.",,,,,,,
"An asylum applicant from Cameroon, whose testimony about persecution (arrest, torture, protest involvement) is deemed credible by an Immigration Judge (I.J.), has their application for asylum and withholding of removal denied due to insufficient corroborating evidence. The I.J. finds that affidavits submitted by family and friends lack personal knowledge of the events and that other forms of corroboration (like medical evidence of injuries) were not provided despite being reasonably available. The applicant argues that the I.J. erred by not following the procedures outlined in *Matter of L-A-C-*, which require an I.J. to first identify specific corroborating evidence, then give the applicant an opportunity to explain its absence, and finally state whether that explanation is sufficient. Did the I.J.'s actions in this case violate the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures?","No, the Immigration Judge's actions did not violate the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures in this case. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the petition for review, affirming the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision, which upheld the I.J.'s denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture (CAT) protection.

The Court held that the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures for identifying specific corroborating evidence and allowing an explanation for its absence apply only when the I.J. requires ""specific corroborating evidence"" and holds one missing piece of evidence to be the *sine qua non* to corroboration. In this case, the I.J. did not impose such a requirement. Instead, the I.J. engaged in a comprehensive analysis, finding that while the applicant's testimony was credible, it was not sufficiently corroborated by the evidence provided, and that other supporting documents would have been reasonably available. The I.J. specifically found the affidavits submitted by the applicant's wife, uncle, neighbor, and family lawyer insufficient because the affiants lacked personal knowledge of the recounted events. Other evidence, such as the applicant's injured foot and general country reports or newspaper articles, was deemed insufficient to compel a conclusion contrary to the I.J.'s finding of insufficient corroboration. The CAT claim was also denied for the same reason—lack of sufficient corroborating evidence.",,,,,,,
"Pardeep Kumar, a native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), as well as the denial of his motion to remand. He alleges both substantive and procedural errors by the BIA and the Immigration Judge (IJ). Based on the Fifth Circuit's review, what was the outcome of his petition, and on what grounds were the various claims resolved?","The Fifth Circuit DISMISSED Pardeep Kumar's petition for review in part for lack of jurisdiction and DENIED it in part. The court lacked jurisdiction over several procedural claims because Kumar failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not properly raising them to the BIA or in a motion for reconsideration. For the claims over which it had jurisdiction, the court denied them:
1.  **Substantive Claims (Asylum, Withholding of Removal, CAT, BIA's factual conclusions, and denial of motion to remand):** These claims were denied because the BIA's factual findings and conclusions were supported by substantial evidence; the evidence did not compel a contrary conclusion that the harm endured amounted to persecution or torture, that the BJP was the Indian government, that the national identification system prevented relocation, or that the medical evaluation supported his claims of BJP attacks. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to remand because the new evidence would not have changed the outcome.
2.  **Due Process Claims:** These claims were denied because Kumar failed to show substantial prejudice, as the alleged errors (discrepancy in the record, failure to advise on medical evaluation/declaration, and denial of continuance) would not have affected the outcome of the proceedings.
3.  **Meaningful Consideration Claims:** These claims were denied because the BIA's decision sufficiently reflected a meaningful consideration of the relevant evidence, referencing the testimony and affidavits Kumar alleged were mischaracterized.",,,,,,,
"An individual from El Salvador, previously ordered removed and later unlawfully re-entered, sought deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) claiming the Salvadoran government would torture him as a suspected gang member due to his tattoos, criminal record, and evidence of police searching for him. His petition for review of the denial of CAT relief was filed with the Court of Appeals, but he was subsequently removed to El Salvador while the appeal was pending. He also provided affidavits detailing a 2023 incident where police searched for him at his father's home. The immigration judge (IJ) denied relief, noting an adverse credibility determination and stating general country conditions were insufficient, but did not mention the affidavits in the likelihood-of-torture assessment. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) adopted the IJ's decision. Does the individual's removal moot his appeal, and did the agency err in denying CAT deferral?","No, the individual's removal from the United States did not moot his petition for review because the availability of an ICE-facilitated return pursuant to the ICE Policy Directive 11061.1 (Return Directive) constitutes ""effective relief."" On the merits, the agency erred by failing to consider critical evidence—specifically, the affidavits describing the January 2023 incident where police searched for him at his father's home—in its likelihood-of-torture assessment for his Convention Against Torture (CAT) claim. The petition for review is granted, and the case is remanded for further consideration of the CAT deferral claim consistent with the opinion.",,,,,,,
"An individual holding an H-4 visa and employment authorization has applied for renewal, but after more than seven months, the applications remain unprocessed. Her employment authorization expired three months ago, leading to her inability to work, loss of her driver's license, and significant financial hardship for her family. She seeks a preliminary injunction to compel the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to process her applications within seven days, alleging unreasonable delay. USCIS, however, asserts that it processes applications on a first-in, first-out basis, and granting the injunction would advance her application over others waiting their turn. Under these circumstances, should a court grant the preliminary injunction?","No, the court should deny the motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate a clear likelihood of success on the merits of her unreasonable delay claim because she did not sufficiently rebut the agency's assertion that it processes applications on a first-in, first-out basis (TRAC Factor 1). Granting the injunction would impermissibly advance her application over others waiting their turn, thereby harming competing priorities (TRAC Factor 4). Furthermore, the public interest weighed against granting the injunction, as jumping one applicant ahead of others in an agency's queue does not serve the public interest. Although the plaintiff did show irreparable harm through the unrecoverable loss of income, this was insufficient to meet her burden given the other factors.",,,,,,,
"A non-profit organization, ""Immigrant Rights Advocates,"" provides pro bono legal services to low-income immigrants. The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) recently finalized a rule significantly increasing fees for various immigration filings, including appeals to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and applications for cancellation of removal. Immigrant Rights Advocates argues that these increased fees will severely limit their ability to provide legal representation, forcing them to take on fewer clients and divert resources to fee waiver applications. They believe EOIR failed to adequately consider these impacts during the rulemaking process. Can Immigrant Rights Advocates successfully challenge the legality of these fee increases, particularly for appeals and cancellation of removal applications, under the Administrative Procedure Act?","Yes, Immigrant Rights Advocates can likely successfully challenge the legality of these specific fee increases under the Administrative Procedure Act. The court found that the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) acted arbitrarily and capriciously by entirely failing to consider an important aspect of the problem: the Final Rule's impact on legal service providers and their capacity to provide legal services to persons subject to removal proceedings. EOIR was obligated to address these concerns as part of the notice-and-comment process but failed to do so. Consequently, the court stayed the effective date and enjoined the implementation of increased fees for: (1) Form EOIR-26 for filing an appeal from a decision of an immigration judge; (2) Form EOIR-29 for filing an appeal from a decision of an officer of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”); (3) filing a motion to reopen or to reconsider before the BIA; (4) Form EOIR-40 for an application for suspension of deportation; (5) Form EOIR-42A for an application for cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents; and (6) Form EOIR-42B for an application for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status for certain nonpermanent residents, pending final adjudication of the action.",,,,,,,
"An individual who has been a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for over five years, but whose initial admission to the U.S. as an ""accompanying"" relative was procedurally flawed because they arrived before the principal immigrant, applies for naturalization. Can this individual be denied naturalization on the grounds that they were not ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence,"" even if the government's window for rescinding their LPR status has closed and there was no fraud or misrepresentation on the applicant's part?","Yes, the individual can be denied naturalization. An applicant for naturalization must establish that they have been ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence."" ""Lawfully admitted"" requires compliance with substantive legal requirements, not just procedural regularity. Therefore, an alien who obtains LPR status due to a government mistake, even without fraud, is not lawfully admitted if they were not substantively entitled to that status. In this situation, entering the U.S. before the principal immigrant violates the ""accompanying"" relative requirement of 22 C.F.R. § 40.1(a)(2), which is consistent with the plain language of 8 U.S.C. § 1153(d). The fact that the five-year statute of limitations for rescinding LPR status has run does not mean the initial entry was lawful or that the individual is eligible for naturalization; it only prevents the government from instituting rescission proceedings. Federal courts also lack the equitable power to grant naturalization outside of the means specified in the Immigration and Nationality Act.",,,,,,,
"In a case where a juvenile court issues an emergency custody order with special findings for a minor seeking Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, and then, without notice or hearing, vacates that order and issues a new one without the special findings, has the court violated procedural due process and abused its discretion?","Yes, the trial court violated procedural due process by vacating its prior orders without a hearing and notice, in violation of Juv.R. 14(C). Given that the trial court's decision denied the minor eligibility for a legal immigration status, it violated the procedural due process rights of the parties. Furthermore, the appellate court found no factual or legal basis for the trial court's decision to vacate the special findings, concluding that it was a clear abuse of discretion. Therefore, the June 2, 2022 ""Order to Vacate Emergency Custody Order"" and the June 2, 2022 ""Emergency Custody Order"" were reversed and vacated, reinstating the June 1, 2022 order, including the requested special findings.",,,,,,,
"A foreign national is convicted of visa fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1546(a) and subsequently faces removal proceedings, charged with removability under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(3)(B)(iii) due to this criminal conviction. They seek to use the visa fraud waiver available under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H) to waive this ground of removability. Can this specific waiver be applied to overcome removability based on a criminal conviction under § 1227(a)(3)(B)(iii)?","No, the visa fraud waiver under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H) cannot waive a ground for removability based on a criminal conviction under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(3)(B)(iii). The § 1227(a)(1)(H) waiver is explicitly limited to ""The provisions of this paragraph"" (referring to § 1227(a)(1)) and applies only to aliens inadmissible due to fraud or misrepresentation under § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), which does not involve a conviction. The ground for removability under § 1227(a)(3)(B)(iii) results directly from a criminal conviction for visa fraud, a distinct charge from inadmissibility due to unprosecuted fraud or misrepresentation. The petitioners also failed to demonstrate a violation of their due process rights. Claims regarding eligibility for hardship waivers or the ability to ""stack"" waivers were not addressed by the Board of Immigration Appeals and, therefore, the court lacked jurisdiction to review them, finding no realistic possibility that a remand would lead to a different conclusion given the unappealable ground for removability.",,,,,,,
"If an alien receives a Notice to Appear (NTA) that does not contain the date and time of their removal proceedings, but subsequently receives a Notice of Hearing (NOH), does the initial defect in the NTA invalidate the removal proceedings, entitling the alien to a remand based on *Rodriguez v.

Garland* if they received, or do not dispute receiving, a subsequent Notice of Hearing, even if the initial Notice to Appear did not contain the date and time of their removal proceedings. The receipt of the NOH distinguishes the case from *Rodriguez*.",,,,,,,
"A public interest organization submits a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to a federal agency, seeking all complaint records filed against its administrative judges. The agency responds by disclosing thousands of pages of documents, but with two types of redactions: (1) all administrative judges' names are redacted, with the agency arguing a blanket privacy interest under FOIA Exemption 6, and (2) discrete sentences or paragraphs within otherwise responsive complaint records are redacted, with the agency asserting that this information is ""non-responsive"" to the request, even if it does not fall under any FOIA exemption. The organization challenges both categories of redactions in court. How should a court rule on these challenges based on the provided case?","Based on the case ruling, the court should rule as follows:
1.  **Redaction of judges' names under Exemption 6:** The agency's categorical, across-the-board redaction of all administrative judges' names would likely be deemed inadequately justified. FOIA Exemption 6 does not categorically exempt individuals' identities, as the privacy and public interests at stake can vary depending on factors such as whether the judge is sitting or retired, the seriousness and number of complaints, and the potential for public understanding of government operations through disclosure. A more individualized inquiry, or a particularized showing for defined subgroups of judges, is required to properly balance the privacy interests against the public interest in disclosure.
2.  **Redaction of non-responsive information within responsive records:** The court should find no statutory basis for redacting ostensibly non-responsive information from a record once that record has been deemed responsive to a FOIA request. Under the statutory framework, once an agency identifies a record as responsive, the sole basis for withholding information within that record is if the information falls within one of FOIA's nine statutory exemptions. Redacting non-exempt information on the basis of non-responsiveness within an otherwise responsive record is not permitted by the statute.",,,,,,,
"A U.S. company, ""InnovateTech Inc."", seeks to extend an H-1B visa for its foreign citizen employee, who works as a ""Lead Software Architect"" at a client site through a subcontracting arrangement. USCIS denies the extension, citing (1) a lack of sufficiently detailed, non-speculative day-to-day work assignments for the entire visa period, (2) perceived inconsistencies in the minimum degree requirements stated across different application documents (e.g., ""bachelor's degree in a computer-related field"" vs. ""bachelor's or higher degree in Information Technology or Computer Science""), and (3) insufficient evidence to prove InnovateTech has ""actual control"" over the employee's specific tasks at the client site, despite InnovateTech providing documentation confirming its exclusive right to hire, pay, fire, and supervise the employee. InnovateTech had also referenced the Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook to argue that a ""Lead Software Architect"" position typically requires a bachelor's degree in a specific specialty, but USCIS did not address this argument in its denial. Can InnovateTech successfully challenge this denial under the Administrative Procedure Act?","Yes, InnovateTech can likely successfully challenge the denial. Based on the provided court ruling, USCIS's denial would be considered arbitrary and capricious for several reasons. First, requiring detailed evidence of non-speculative day-to-day work assignments for the entire visa duration and focusing a ""searching inquiry into the specific services"" goes against established legal precedent regarding the ""specialty occupation"" requirement. Second, USCIS's failure to meaningfully consider or even mention InnovateTech's argument that the position is akin to an occupation described in the Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook, which could satisfy the specialty occupation criteria, renders the decision arbitrary and capricious. Third, USCIS's demand for evidence of ""actual control"" over the employee's work and duties beyond the ability to hire, pay, or fire, when InnovateTech has provided evidence of the legal right to control these factors, is inconsistent with regulatory language that states these factors are independently sufficient to establish an employer-employee relationship. The court would likely grant InnovateTech's motion for summary judgment and remand the case for reconsideration consistent with these principles.",,,,,,,
"An individual challenges an immigration judge's in absentia removal order, arguing the NTA was defective because it omitted the date and time of proceedings. However, the individual admits to having received a subsequent notice of hearing (NOH). Does the receipt of a subsequent NOH affect the individual's ability to successfully challenge the removal order based on a defective NTA?","No, the receipt of a subsequent Notice of Hearing (NOH) undermines the argument that the immigration judge lacked authority to conduct removal proceedings due to an initially defective NTA. The court distinguishes such a case from situations where no subsequent NOH was received, concluding that the petition for review challenging the removal order should be denied.",,,,,,,
"An individual, native and citizen of Mexico, is ordered removed from the U.S. after being convicted in Texas of aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon. The individual argues that this conviction does not qualify as an ""aggravated felony"" under federal immigration law, and thus he is not removable. He also challenges the denial of his motion for continuance, claiming the immigration judge abused discretion by finding he lacked ""good cause."" Based on U.S. federal court precedent, should the petition for review challenging the removability finding and the denial of continuance be granted?","No, the petition for review should be denied. Aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon under Texas law is considered a crime of violence and, therefore, an aggravated felony for purposes of federal immigration law because it requires the intentional or knowing use or attempted use of physical force with a deadly weapon. The Texas offense requires the use or exhibition of a deadly weapon in a manner that facilitates the associated felony, satisfying the federal definition of a crime of violence. Consequently, an individual convicted of this offense is removable. Furthermore, the denial of a motion for continuance is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and immigration judges may consider a wide range of factors, including criminal history, in determining ""good cause."" Given that an immigration judge cited such factors, declining to find an abuse of discretion is appropriate.",,,,,,,
"An immigrant invested $500,000 in an American business, believing it would qualify them for an EB-5 immigrant investor visa. USCIS initially approved the I-526 petition but later initiated revocation proceedings, arguing the investment funds (loan proceeds from a jointly owned property) were not entirely the immigrant's ""own capital at risk."" USCIS then issued a decision explicitly stating the visa petition was ""denied,"" not ""revoked."" The immigrant, through new counsel, filed a motion to reopen or reconsider (MTR), citing ineffective assistance of prior counsel and a new interpretation of the loan documents. USCIS denied the MTR. If the immigrant seeks judicial review in federal court, challenging both the ""denial"" of the visa petition and the denial of the MTR, will the federal court have subject matter jurisdiction, and what must the immigrant specifically allege to adequately state a claim regarding the denial of the MTR?","Yes, the federal court will have subject matter jurisdiction. The court will treat the initial USCIS decision as a ""denial"" of a visa petition, which is subject to judicial review, rather than an unreviewable ""revocation,"" especially when the agency's decision documents explicitly characterize it as a denial. The court will also have jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider. However, to adequately state a claim challenging the denial of a motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the immigrant must allege that specific procedural requirements were met: (1) providing an affidavit describing the agreement with counsel in detail; (2) informing counsel of the allegations and affording counsel an opportunity to respond; and (3) reporting whether a complaint of ethical or legal violations has been filed, and if not, why. For a motion to reconsider, the immigrant must establish that the decision was based on an incorrect application of law or Service policy, supported by pertinent precedent decisions, and not merely raise new factual interpretations of documents.",,,,,,,
"A regional center, originally designated in 2010 under the prior EB-5 regional-center statute, maintains ongoing investments with 23 investors whose petitions are pending. However, it has not sponsored any new investment projects or investors since the passage of the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022. The regional center challenges the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' (USCIS) imposition of the annual EB-5 Integrity Fund Fee, arguing that it was not ""designated under subparagraph (E)"" of the new Act and that applying the fee retroactively would be unlawful. Must this regional center pay the annual Integrity Fund Fee?","Yes, the regional center must pay the annual Integrity Fund Fee. The court held that the phrase ""designated under subparagraph (E)"" applies to all currently designated regional centers, regardless of when their designation initially began. The word ""designated"" in the statute refers to an ongoing status rather than a one-time past event. The court reasoned that the Act's overall framework, the usage of ""designate"" versus ""establish,"" and the Act's purpose (to combat fraud that arose from pre-Act regional centers) support this broad interpretation. Furthermore, the court concluded that the Integrity Fund Fee is not unlawfully retroactive; it is a forward-looking, prospective fee for continued participation in the EB-5 regional-center program, not a penalty for past conduct or an imposition of new duties on already completed transactions.",,,,,,,
"My client was lawfully present in the U.S. on an H1B visa but was convicted of conspiracy to commit money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h), involving over $10,000. He fears he will be found removable as an aggravated felon and wants to know if there are any grounds to challenge this or seek a waiver of inadmissibility, especially considering his claim that his conviction did not require proof of an overt act. He also believes his removal proceedings were flawed due to a defective notice to appear and missing hearing transcripts. What does the law say about his situation, particularly regarding the definition of an aggravated felony and his eligibility for relief?","The court denied the petition for review in part and dismissed it in part. The court affirmed that a conviction for conspiracy to commit money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) involving funds exceeding $10,000 plainly constitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(D), making the individual removable. It was deemed unnecessary to address whether such a conviction also qualified under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(U) or required proof of an overt act.
Regarding the claim for a waiver of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), the court dismissed this petition for lack of jurisdiction because the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not raising the ""overt act"" argument concerning inadmissibility before the BIA. Additionally, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(I)(ii), which covers knowing conspirators in money laundering offenses, is not among the provisions for which waivers are available under § 1182(h).
The due process challenge concerning allegedly missing hearing transcripts was denied because the petitioner failed to demonstrate any substantial prejudice. Lastly, the argument that the immigration authorities lacked jurisdiction due to a defective notice to appear, based on *Pereira v. Sessions*, was denied, as the court reiterated that its precedent holds *Pereira* and *Niz-Chavez v. Garland* do not extend beyond the ""stop-time rule"" context for valid charging documents under INA regulations.",,,,,,,
"An individual is found removable under U.S. immigration law as an alien convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude. One of the convictions is for making terroristic threats in violation of section 609.713, subdivision 1, of the Minnesota Statutes. The individual argues this specific offense is not a crime involving moral turpitude. Based on U.S. federal immigration court precedent, how would this argument likely be addressed regarding the classification of the Minnesota terroristic threats offense?","The offense of making terroristic threats in violation of section 609.713, subdivision 1, of the Minnesota Statutes is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude. The communication of an intent to injure another by use of violence, made either with the specific intent to ""terrorize"" another or with a conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk of terrorizing another, is reprehensible conduct. Furthermore, making threats with purpose to cause evacuation of a building, place of assembly, vehicle or facility of public transportation or otherwise to cause serious public inconvenience, or in a reckless disregard of the risk of causing such inconvenience, is also reprehensible conduct.",,,,,,,
"Can a foreign investor compel U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to expedite the processing of their Form I-526 application for an EB-5 immigrant visa, alleging an unreasonable 30-month delay that has led to mental and physical health issues, when USCIS follows a visa availability approach and Congress has not set a binding timeline for such adjudications?","No, a foreign investor cannot compel USCIS to expedite processing under these circumstances. The court found that USCIS had not unreasonably delayed in adjudicating the Form I-526 application. Applying the *TRAC* factors, the court determined that USCIS's visa availability approach constituted a rule of reason, and there was no binding congressional timeline. The effective 30-month delay was not considered unreasonable compared to similar cases. Crucially, granting relief would require reordering USCIS's priorities and would unfairly prejudice other applicants, a factor that weighed strongly in USCIS's favor. Although the Olofins' allegations of mental and physical health issues slightly favored them, these were not deemed grave enough to overcome the other factors supporting USCIS's position, especially the strong weight given to the agency's competing priorities. No impropriety on USCIS's part was alleged.",,,,,,,
"Is sexual solicitation of a minor, in violation of section 3-324(b) of the Maryland Criminal Law, categorically a crime involving moral turpitude, and how does this affect an alien's eligibility for cancellation of removal, particularly concerning the mental state required regarding the victim's age?","Sexual solicitation of a minor in violation of section 3-324(b) of the Maryland Criminal Law with the intent to engage in an unlawful sexual offense under section 3-307 is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude, even when the statute requires no culpable mental state as to the age of the child. The Board of Immigration Appeals reaffirmed this position, clarifying that a sexual offense targeting very young victims (under 14, or under 16 with a significant age differential) is a CIMT due to inherent antisocial and depraved nature, regardless of a mistake of age defense. However, in light of the Fourth Circuit's view that the Board's prior decision represented a change in position, this holding will be applied prospectively in the Fourth Circuit. Therefore, the respondent in this case is not found removable on the CIMT ground and remains statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal, with the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for discretionary review of relief.",,,,,,,
"Under U.S. federal immigration law, can a former government employee of a foreign country's prison system, who received military training and monitored inmates, establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal based on a fear of persecution from criminal gangs, if the perceived threat stems from the nature of their former employment rather than an immutable characteristic, a protected social group, or a statutorily recognized political opinion?","The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied the petition for review, affirming the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision that the petitioner, a former employee of El Salvador's Ministry of Justice, was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal. The court concluded that substantial evidence supported the BIA's finding that the petitioner failed to show the requisite nexus between the harm she feared and suffered and a protected statutory ground. The court agreed that her role, which included monitoring prisoners via video, receiving military training, wearing a uniform and mask, and being identified by gangs due to her employment, meant the dangers she faced arose from the nature of her employment and domestic unrest, not from a protected ground, consistent with *Matter of Fuentes*. Furthermore, the court rejected her argument of an imputed anti-gang political opinion, noting that ""pro rule-of-law, anti-corruption, and anti-gang"" is not a recognized political opinion for asylum and that criminally-motivated actions (such as gangs seeking to exploit her work-related access and knowledge) do not constitute persecution on account of a protected ground. As she failed to establish asylum eligibility, she also failed to meet the higher burden for withholding of removal.",,,,,,,
"Can a U.S. federal agency refuse to fulfill a broadly worded FOIA request seeking all emails from high-ranking officials over a period of several months if the agency determines that the effort required for review, redaction, and production is unduly burdensome, even if the request describes the documents with sufficient precision to locate them?","Yes, a U.S. federal agency can refuse such a request. Binding precedent in the D.C. Circuit establishes that an agency need not respond to requests that entail an unduly burdensome effort of review, redaction, and production, even if the documents are described with sufficient precision. In this case, the requests sought ""all records sent or received electronically"" by three high-ranking officials over a nine-month period, yielding over 1.6 million pages and an estimated processing time of over two years and nine months (8,151 hours). The Court found this burden too high, particularly because the requests were not tailored to specific policy concerns, thus requiring the agency to process thousands of documents with no conceivable relation to the requester's stated interest (e.g., workplace emails about miscellaneous topics or health care plans). The Court also noted the risk of severe interference with the agency's IT systems due to the large data transfer. Therefore, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of the agency, concluding that the requests required an unduly burdensome post-search effort.",,,,,,,
"A manufacturing company, facing numerous charges for failing to verify employee work authorization and knowingly continuing to employ unauthorized aliens, seeks to overturn an administrative law judge's decision. The company argues that it acted in good faith by hiring a purportedly qualified HR director whose negligence led to the violations. It also claims that many violations are barred by the five-year statute of limitations. Furthermore, the company challenges the summarily imposed civil penalties, arguing that its severe financial distress (including significant net losses and pending bankruptcy) constitutes a material factual dispute regarding its ability to pay, which should have precluded summary determination of the penalty amount. How would a federal court likely rule on each of these arguments?","A federal court would likely rule as follows:
1.  **Good Faith Defense:** The court would likely reject the good faith defenses. The defense under 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(a)(3) applies only to knowing *hiring* violations, not *continuing employment* or *paperwork* violations. The defense under 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(6) is limited to *technical or procedural* failures, not substantive ones, and the HR director's failure to perform their duties would be properly imputed to the company as its agent.
2.  **Statute of Limitations (General):** The court would likely reject a generalized statute of limitations defense for most violations if it was not properly asserted with a statement of facts as required by 28 C.F.R. § 68.9(c). For paperwork violations, the five-year limitations period is measured from when the company was no longer required to retain the I-9 form (three years after hire or one year after termination, whichever is later). For continuing employment violations, it is measured from the last day of the ineligible alien's employment.
3.  **Statute of Limitations (Specific Untimely Claim):** However, the court would likely grant the petition for review as to a specific violation if the claim accrued more than five years before the administrative action was commenced (e.g., employment ended before the five-year window) and the agency itself had conceded the untimeliness. The limitations period begins when the claim first accrued, not when the penalty is administratively imposed.
4.  **Summary Determination of Penalty:** The court would likely uphold the summary determination of the penalty. While ""ability to pay"" is a factor that an ALJ may consider at their discretion, it is not one of the five mandatory factors listed in 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(e)(5). Because it is within the ALJ's power to decline to consider this factor at all, the company's ability to pay is not considered a *material* issue of fact that would preclude summary determination of the penalty amount. The ALJ's decision to proceed despite ambiguities in financial evidence would be considered an implicit choice to give that factor no weight, and this does not warrant reversal. The court would also typically uphold the ALJ's consideration of the statutory factors (size of business, good faith, seriousness of violations, whether the employee is an unauthorized alien, and history of previous violations) if the penalty falls within the prescribed monetary range and is reasonably based on the evidence presented.",,,,,,,
"Under U.S. federal law, can an individual asylum seeker successfully sue federal officials in their individual capacities for money damages based on constitutional violations stemming from a family separation policy, or obtain declaratory and injunctive relief against such policies from federal agencies and officials in their official capacities, after being reunited with their child and the policy being altered and enjoined?","The court would dismiss claims against federal officials in their individual capacities for money damages. These claims require the expansion of *Bivens* remedies to a new context, which is a ""disfavored judicial activity."" ""Special factors counseling hesitation"" preclude such expansion, including that *Bivens* suits are not the appropriate mechanism to challenge general government policies, alternative methods of relief (such as class actions or official capacity suits for injunctions) are available, and the claims challenge powers subject to extensive Congressional action, particularly in immigration matters.

Claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against federal agencies and officials in their official capacities would be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to mootness. Such claims become moot when the plaintiff has been reunited with their child, has passed a credible fear interview, has been released from detention, and the challenged policy has been changed by Executive Order and enjoined nationwide by a separate class action lawsuit. In these circumstances, neither a declaratory judgment nor an injunction would ""presently affect the parties’ rights nor have a more-than-speculative chance of affecting them in the future."" The voluntary cessation exception to mootness does not apply when the cessation of challenged activity is due to reasons unrelated to the instant litigation, such as statutory obligations, broader policy changes, or a class-wide preliminary injunction, and it is ""absolutely clear that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be expected to start up again.""",,,,,,,
"A group of international students, who were unknowingly enrolled in a sham university created by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as part of a sting operation, received letters terminating their F-1 nonimmigrant student status due to ""fraudulent enrollment."" They filed a class action lawsuit challenging this termination under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging due process violations, and seeking an order preventing the government from deeming their enrollment fraudulent. The District Court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that the termination was not a final agency action and the case was not ripe for review because reinstatement proceedings were pending or removal proceedings could provide administrative relief. Are the students' claims for judicial review of the F-1 visa termination a final agency action and ripe for review, despite the availability of reinstatement applications or the potential for future removal proceedings?","Yes, the students' claims for judicial review of the F-1 visa termination are a final agency action and ripe for review. The termination of their F-1 visas constituted a final agency action because there is no statutory or regulatory requirement that a student seek reinstatement, and reinstatement proceedings do not provide a mechanism to review the original termination order or the propriety of the ""fraudulent enrollment"" decision. Unlike asylum terminations, the F-1 termination was the culmination, not the initiation, of the agency's decision-making process. Furthermore, the students are not required to wait for removal proceedings to be instituted, as such proceedings may never occur, and immigration judges and the Board of Immigration Appeals lack the authority to review USCIS's discretionary denial of reinstatement. The case is also ripe for review because the parties are in a sufficiently adversarial posture, the students are genuinely aggrieved by the termination of their lawful status and the notation of fraud on their records, and the government's inconsistent position on the students' culpability underscores the need for judicial review that would otherwise be unavailable.",,,,,,,
"A Ukrainian national, paroled into the U.S. in 2022, brought an Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claim against USCIS for unlawfully charging a $410 filing fee for employment authorization. The plaintiff argued that the Ukrainian Parolee Act entitled her to fee exemption, and the court agreed that her claim for a refund was not barred by sovereign immunity under the APA. Despite this, the court still dismissed the APA claim. What was the court's reasoning for dismissing the APA claim, and what alternative remedy did it identify as adequate?","The court dismissed the plaintiff's APA claim because she had an ""adequate remedy"" at law, which is an element of an APA cause of action under 5 U.S.C. § 704. The court found that a Tucker Act suit in the Court of Federal Claims or a Little Tucker Act suit in a federal district court would provide an adequate alternative remedy. These alternatives could offer the monetary relief (a refund) that the plaintiff sought and allow for review of the challenged agency action to the same extent as an APA case. The court reasoned that a monetary award would necessarily be predicated on a finding of legal error by the agency, effectively forcing the agency to cease its unlawful practice, making these alternatives adequate even if they didn't explicitly provide declaratory relief.",,,,,,,
"Can a noncitizen residing outside the U.S. successfully sue the government for unreasonable delay in processing a worker's visa application, citing violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause, when the delay is primarily attributed to a global pandemic and the applicant seeks initial entry?","No. The court dismissed the claims, finding that some defendants (USCIS, its Director, and the Secretary of State) were moot because they lacked the authority to provide the requested relief. Regarding the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claim, the court determined that an eighteen-month (or even two-year) delay in scheduling a visa interview was not unreasonable as a matter of law, especially given the ""substantial backlogs"" caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the government's efforts to protect public health. Applying the TRAC factors, the court noted that Congress sets no statutory deadline for visa processing, the prejudice alleged was primarily financial rather than health-related, and expediting the applicant's case would merely reorder the queue without net gain. Concerning the Due Process claim, the court held that a noncitizen seeking initial admission to the United States has no constitutional rights under the Due Process Clause regarding their application, as the power to admit or exclude noncitizens is a sovereign prerogative and their only procedural rights are those conferred by statute.",,,,,,,
"Under what circumstances will a U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia transfer a case challenging a USCIS visa denial to another district, particularly when the plaintiff chose the D.C. forum but the administrative decision was made elsewhere?","A U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia will transfer a case challenging a USCIS visa denial to another district, such as the District of Nebraska, when the balance of private and public interest factors strongly favors the transferee forum. In such cases, the court will grant a motion to transfer pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), concluding that the case ""might have been brought"" in the transferee court and that transfer is ""in the interest of justice.""

Specifically, the court considers:
1.  **Propriety of Venue in Transferee Court:** Venue is proper in the transferee court if, under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e), a defendant resides there, a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred there, or the plaintiff resides there. For cases challenging USCIS decisions, venue is typically proper in the district where the relevant service center (e.g., Nebraska Service Center) is located and processed the petition, or where the plaintiff resides.
2.  **Balancing of Private Interest Factors:**
    *   **Plaintiff's Choice of Forum:** The deference given to the plaintiff's choice of forum is significantly reduced when it is not the plaintiff's home forum and lacks meaningful ties to the controversy. If the administrative decision being challenged was made in another district, the D.C. court will give ""nadir"" deference to the plaintiff's choice to sue in D.C.
    *   **Defendant's Choice of Forum:** This choice gains some deference, especially when the defendants seek transfer to the plaintiff's home forum or where the claim arose.
    *   **Where the Claim Arose:** This is a predominant factor. In Administrative Procedure Act (APA) cases challenging agency action, the claim generally arises where the decision-making process occurred. If the visa petition was processed, adjudicated, and denied by a USCIS service center in another district (e.g., Nebraska), then the claim arose in that district, not D.C., even if general agency policies were formulated in D.C., unless there are credible allegations of direct, case-specific involvement by D.C.-based officials.
    *   **Convenience of Parties, Witnesses, and Access to Proof:** Convenience factors typically favor the district where the plaintiff resides (if applicable) or, more strongly, the district where the administrative record is located and where the agency personnel involved in the challenged decision reside, as APA cases are generally resolved on the administrative record.
3.  **Balancing of Public Interest Factors:**
    *   **Familiarity with Governing Laws:** This factor is neutral for federal law cases as all federal courts are presumed equally familiar.
    *   **Relative Congestion of Calendars:** While current statistics might slightly favor D.C. in terms of caseload, this factor is often a ""wash"" due to the difficulty of accurate assessment and the concern about future congestion if D.C. retains cases with little connection to the district.
    *   **Local Interest in Resolving the Controversy:** This is the ""most important"" public factor. The district where the challenged decision was made (e.g., Nebraska Service Center) has the strongest local interest, especially if the relief sought involves compelling specific actions in that district. A case challenging a single visa petition's denial is typically not considered one of ""national significance.""

In sum, the court will transfer the case to the district where the administrative decision was made and where the bulk of the administrative record and relevant agency personnel are located, finding it to be the optimal venue when D.C. lacks meaningful ties to the specific controversy.",,,,,,,
"Apex Construction Inc. hired several new employees. For some, the employees signed Section 1 of the I-9 Form but failed to check the box indicating their specific work authorization status (e.g., U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident). For others, Apex completed Section 2 but failed to list the issuing authority for a driver's license presented as proof of identity. Apex had photocopied all identity and work authorization documents and kept them in a separate folder, believing that the copies, combined with the employee's signature, fulfilled its obligations. During an ICE inspection, these issues were flagged. Apex later produced the copied documents during the administrative hearing, arguing they cured the I-9 deficiencies and showed good faith. Apex now faces civil penalties. Based on the *Ketchikan Drywall Services* decision, how should a court evaluate Apex Construction Inc.'s arguments regarding its I-9 compliance, the nature of its violations, and the potential for penalty mitigation?","Based on the *Ketchikan Drywall Services* decision, Apex Construction Inc.'s arguments would likely be rejected, and the penalties upheld. The court would find that employers must fully complete I-9 Forms, and merely copying and retaining verification documents is neither necessary nor sufficient for compliance, nor does it relieve the employer of the requirement to fully complete Section 2. The regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 274a.2(b)(3), clarifies that copying and retention do not relieve the employer from fully completing Section 2, superseding any prior interpretations to the contrary.

Regarding the specific violations:
1.  **Failure to check a specific box in Section 1:** This is considered a ""substantive"" verification failure under the Virtue Memorandum (which the court grants Skidmore deference). Employees are required to attest to a specific category of eligibility, and failure to check the appropriate box means the statutory requirement (8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(2)) is unfulfilled, regardless of whether other documentation might allow ICE to deduce the employee's status. Employers are responsible for ensuring Section 1 is completely filled out by employees.
2.  **Failure to list the issuing authority for a List B document (e.g., driver's license) in Section 2:** This is a substantive failure. Employers have an obligation to fill out Section 2 of their I-9 Forms ""fully,"" and the absence of the issuing authority constitutes a failure to identify the document utilized, even if ICE might deduce the information from other details.

The court would likely find that the late production of copied documents during the administrative hearing cannot cure substantive deficiencies. The Virtue Memorandum only excuses certain substantive deficiencies where the missing information is found ""on a legible copy of a document retained *with* the Form I-9 and *presented at the I-9 inspection*."" Documents not presented at the initial I-9 inspection do not qualify. The penalties are imposed for substantive deficiencies on the I-9 Forms themselves, not for the manner or timing of document storage or production.

Finally, concerning penalty mitigation, the ALJ has broad discretion. A refusal to mitigate for ""good faith"" would be permissible if, for example, Apex had a history of non-compliance or demonstrated a lack of timely effort to ascertain and conform to the law. Similarly, a refusal to mitigate for ""non-seriousness"" would be upheld, as the penalties are for substantive deficiencies in the I-9 Forms.",,,,,,,
"A nurse from a war-torn region claims asylum, alleging past persecution based on an imputed political opinion (assisting separatists) and Anglophone ethnicity, supported by credible testimony of repeated arrests, beatings, credible death threats, and the disappearance of fellow detainees. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denies relief, finding no past persecution because the injuries were not ""extreme,"" no nexus to a protected ground (as the military targeted him due to his occupation as a nurse, not political opinion), and insufficient corroborating evidence (lack of photos/medical records) despite the nurse's explanation for their absence and submission of affidavits. The BIA also finds the fear of future persecution unreasonable due to changed country conditions, citing a government exhibit that also contains contradictory evidence of continued atrocities. Would a U.S. Court of Appeals uphold the BIA's denial of asylum and withholding of removal?","No, a U.S. Court of Appeals would not uphold the BIA's denial of asylum and withholding of removal under these circumstances. The petition for review as to the asylum and withholding of removal claims would be granted, the BIA's decision vacated, and the case remanded for further proceedings. This is because the BIA's determination regarding past persecution failed to account for credible death threats accompanied by beatings, and its determination regarding nexus failed to address evidence that the persecutors imputed a political opinion to the applicant, stating he was ""fighting them"" despite his occupation as a nurse. Furthermore, the BIA erred by not addressing the applicant's explanations for the lack of certain corroborating evidence (seized phone, fear of hospitals) and by failing to consider affidavits submitted. Finally, the BIA's finding on changed country conditions would be vacated for not considering contradictory evidence within its own cited exhibit. The denial of the Convention Against Torture (CAT) claim would be upheld if the petitioner forfeited other arguments by not briefing them and the BIA's deliberation was deemed sufficient.",,,,,,,
"An organization applies for recognition to provide low-cost immigration legal services. However, it has not yet obtained official nonprofit status and shares physical location, officers, and directors with a for-profit job placement company that also provides immigration services. The Department of Homeland Security recommends against approval, citing concerns about the lack of nonprofit status and the potential for the organization to be influenced by the for-profit venture's pecuniary interests. Will the Board of Immigration Appeals approve this organization's application for recognition?","No, the Board of Immigration Appeals will disapprove the application for recognition. The organization has not provided the requisite evidence of its nonprofit status. Even if it had, the application would still be disapproved because the organization is physically colocated and affiliated with a for-profit venture, shares officers and directors, and the Board is not confident that the organization will operate independently and not be influenced by the for-profit affiliate's pecuniary interests. An applicant must affirmatively demonstrate that its immigration services are not part of a larger commercial enterprise and do not act as a façade or conduit for a business venture, which this applicant failed to do.",,,,,,,
"If an immigration applicant's testimony is deemed not credible by an Immigration Judge (IJ) and affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), but the applicant has submitted extensive non-testimonial country conditions evidence to support a claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), can the BIA deny the CAT claim by stating the claim is based solely on the not-credible testimony and that the applicant points to no other objective evidence?","No, the BIA cannot deny a CAT claim by stating that it is based solely on not-credible testimony and that the applicant points to no other objective evidence, when the applicant has submitted non-testimonial country conditions evidence. CAT claims are distinct from asylum and withholding-of-removal claims and require separate analytical attention. The BIA is required to consider country conditions evidence in its likelihood-of-torture assessment, and this requirement has no exception for cases of adverse credibility determinations. When an applicant offers non-testimonial evidence that could independently establish eligibility for CAT relief, an adverse credibility finding alone cannot defeat the claim. Failure to consider such evidence, or appearing to deny its existence in the record, is an error requiring remand for further consideration.",,,,,,,
"An individual has legally resided in the U.S. for years, is married to an H-1B visa holder with a pending green card application, and has her H-4 nonimmigrant status and Employment Authorization Document (EAD) renewal applications pending with USCIS. Her EAD has expired due to USCIS processing delays, causing her to lose her job and driver's license. She seeks a preliminary injunction to compel USCIS to immediately adjudicate her applications. Based on the *TRAC* factors for unreasonable delay, is she likely to succeed on the merits of her claim and thus be granted a preliminary injunction?","No, the individual is not likely to succeed on the merits of her claim and thus will not be granted a preliminary injunction. The court found that USCIS's delay in adjudicating her applications was not sufficiently unreasonable *at present*. Applying the *TRAC* factors:
1.  **Rule of Reason:** USCIS's ""first-in, first-out"" processing system was considered a rule of reason, favoring defendants.
2.  **Congressional Timetable:** While 8 U.S.C. § 1571(b) suggests processing within 180 days (six months), the plaintiff's applications had been pending for less than four months when the decision was made, so this factor favored defendants *for the moment*.
3.  **Human Health and Welfare / Interests Prejudiced:** These factors favored the plaintiff, acknowledging the significant hardship beyond mere economic harm, including loss of employment, inability to drive, and potential impact on her new restaurant's employees, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
4.  **Effect on Competing Priorities:** This factor favored defendants. Granting relief would place the plaintiff ahead of other similarly situated applicants facing delays due to USCIS backlogs in biometrics scheduling, merely reordering the queue without addressing the systemic issue.
Considering these factors as a whole, the court concluded that the rule of reason, the fact that the six-month congressional window had not yet elapsed, and the concern about reordering the queue outweighed the substantial hardships to the plaintiff, meaning the delay was not yet ""so egregious as to warrant mandamus"" or APA relief.",,,,,,,
"A 17-year-old from Honduras, initially ordered removed, re-enters the U.S. alone and is categorized as an unaccompanied minor. He then files a motion to reopen his prior removal proceedings, arguing that he should have been placed in mandatory TVPRA proceedings and that newly available evidence concerning his sexual orientation makes him eligible for asylum. If the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denies this motion without substantively addressing the TVPRA argument or adequately considering the new evidence's availability and materiality, what recourse does he have in federal court, and what is the likely outcome?","The federal court will vacate the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision and remand the case. The court will rule that the case is not moot because applying the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) could invalidate the existing removal order and create an alternative pathway for asylum. The BIA erred by failing to substantively consider and resolve the petitioner's TVPRA arguments, which mandate that unaccompanied noncitizen children be placed in specific removal proceedings. Additionally, the BIA failed to address whether the new evidence concerning the petitioner's sexual orientation and experiences with threats of violence in Honduras was previously unavailable and material for asylum eligibility, as required for a motion to reopen.",,,,,,,
"Under what circumstances can a federal court transfer a civil action from the District of Columbia to another district, such as Nebraska or North Dakota, when the plaintiff is challenging a federal agency's decision?","A federal court may transfer a civil action to another district where it might have been brought if the private and public interest factors weigh in favor of transfer. In this case, the D.C. court found that the District of Columbia lacked a meaningful nexus to the lawsuit, as the plaintiff (a North Dakota company) was challenging the denial of visa petitions by USCIS's Nebraska Service Center, where the allegedly unlawful denials took place and the administrative record is located. Despite the agency's headquarters being in D.C., the specific dispute focused on decisions made in Nebraska. Therefore, both private interest factors (plaintiff's chosen forum deference weakened, convenience of parties/witnesses, ease of access to proof) and public interest factors (local interest in deciding controversies at home) favored transferring the case to the District of Nebraska.",,,,,,,
"Must U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) consider placement in the least restrictive setting available, including alternative detention programs, for all unaccompanied alien children who turn 18 and are transferred to DHS custody, regardless of their perceived flight risk or current immigration procedural status, and can a class action be certified to challenge a systematic failure to do so?","Yes, the court ruled that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have a non-discretionary statutory duty to consider placement in the least restrictive setting available, including alternative to detention programs, for all former unaccompanied alien children who turn 18 and are transferred to DHS custody. The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, rejecting arguments that the plaintiffs lacked standing, that their claims were moot, or that the claims were not reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act. The court explicitly found that the statutory obligation under 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(B) applies to all such individuals upon transfer to DHS custody, regardless of the agency's flight risk or dangerousness determinations, and irrespective of the specific provision under which the individual is detained. Furthermore, the court granted class certification for all former unaccompanied alien children who are or will be detained by ICE after turning 18 and being transferred by ORR, and as to whom ICE did not consider placement in the least restrictive setting available, including alternatives to detention programs, as required by 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(2)(B), finding that the class met all requirements for certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2).",,,,,,,
"If a Mexican citizen, who publicly campaigned against the Mexican Navy following the disappearance of her son, had her vacant home ransacked and observed Navy vehicles drive by her house once, but experienced no direct threats or further incidents, would she and her minor children be entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention Against Torture in the U.S. based on past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution?","No, the petitioners would not be entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention Against Torture.
The court denied the petition for review, affirming the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision.

1.  **Asylum:**
    *   **Past Persecution:** The BIA did not err in finding no past persecution. The ransacking of the vacant home was a singular event that did not cause serious or permanent damage and was more akin to ""abusive or harassing treatment"" than ""extreme conduct"" required for persecution. The incidents (ransacking and Navy vehicles driving by) did not create a threat sufficiently menacing or imminent to amount to persecution. Rangel had publicly campaigned against the Navy for four months without physical harm or direct threats, and the alleged threat lacked the ""organized, relentless campaign of intimidation"" found in cases compelling a finding of persecution.
    *   **Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution:** The BIA did not err. Petitioners failed to establish past persecution, thus were not entitled to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear. Rangel had publicly campaigned against the Navy for four months without suffering physical harm, threats, or reprisals until the ransacking, and no further threats took place after that incident. There was no indication the Navy remained interested in or actively searching for petitioners, and the disappearance of Rangel's other son was determined to be unrelated to her campaigning.

2.  **Withholding of Removal:** The BIA did not err. Withholding of removal is a higher standard than asylum. Since petitioners failed to demonstrate they suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution for asylum, they necessarily failed to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.

3.  **Convention Against Torture (CAT) Relief:** The BIA did not err. Torture is a higher bar than persecution. Since the basis for relief advanced by petitioners did not even rise to the level of persecution, it follows a fortiori that it does not constitute torture. Additionally, the minor children's claims, based entirely on Rangel's experiences, independently failed as they would not be personally at risk of torture.",,,,,,,
"Can a U.S. federal district court compel the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to adjudicate an alien's 35-year-old application for lawful permanent resident status under the laws and facts as they existed at the time of the original filing, specifically to enable the alien to seek a deportation waiver that was subsequently repealed, given the alien's intervening criminal conviction and fraudulent conduct?","No, a U.S. federal district court cannot compel such adjudication under these circumstances. The court ruled against Armando Garcia on both his claims. For his Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) claim, the court granted summary judgment to USCIS, concluding that USCIS had adequately searched for a record of any adjudication of his 1981 application, albeit unsuccessfully. For his claim seeking reconsideration and adjudication of his 1981 lawful permanent resident (LPR) request under the facts and law as they stood in 1981, the court granted Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. The court determined that Garcia lacked standing because his theory of relief was too speculative and spectral, requiring extraordinary *nunc pro tunc* equitable remedies. The court doubted its authority to grant such extensive *nunc pro tunc* relief, which would entail ignoring subsequent criminal convictions and changes in immigration laws, and found it unwarranted on equitable grounds due to Garcia's fraudulent behavior and delays. The court found that any injury was not redressable because there was no guarantee of LPR status, and no guarantee of obtaining a discretionary § 212(c) waiver, which no longer exists.",,,,,,,
"An individual, Mr. Rodriguez, is a long-time lawful permanent resident of the U.S. who has a final order of removal. After the initial 90-day statutory removal period, he is detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for an additional 10 months. During this prolonged detention, he alleges that federal immigration officials, knowing that his removal to his home country was not possible and that he was ineligible for removal to a third country, made false statements in official documents to justify his continued detention. Mr. Rodriguez seeks monetary damages against these federal officials under a *Bivens* action, claiming violations of his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights for unreasonable seizure and prolonged detention without due process. Can Mr. Rodriguez pursue a *Bivens* action for damages against the federal immigration officials under these circumstances?","No, Mr. Rodriguez cannot pursue a *Bivens* action for damages against the federal immigration officials for unconstitutionally prolonged detention under these circumstances, although federal courts do have subject matter jurisdiction to hear such a claim.

The court finds that claims challenging prolonged detention after the 90-day removal period, based on allegations that officials knew removal was impossible and prolonged detention for other reasons, do not ""arise from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders"" under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). Therefore, this specific type of claim is not barred by that jurisdictional statute.

However, the court holds that no *Bivens* remedy is available. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) is considered an ""elaborate remedial system"" that provides ""sufficient meaningful remedies"" for aliens, including numerous administrative review procedures and the availability of a writ of habeas corpus to challenge detention. Congress's frequent amendments to the INA without providing a damages remedy suggests a deliberate omission. The absence of monetary relief within this statutory scheme is not a sufficient reason to create a new *Bivens* remedy. Additionally, several ""special factors"" counsel against extending *Bivens* into this context: the breadth and detail of the INA itself, the importance of demonstrating due respect for the Constitution's separation of powers (Congress's power over naturalization and the Executive's role in foreign relations), and the doctrinal novelty and administrative difficulty of such a claim, which could lead to widespread litigation and potentially chill robust enforcement of immigration laws.",,,,,,,
"Under what circumstances can an immigrant investor compel USCIS to expedite the adjudication of their I-526 petition, particularly if they are from an underrepresented country and have waited for approximately 29 months, including a period when the underlying program was temporarily lapsed?","An immigrant investor generally cannot compel USCIS to expedite the adjudication of an I-526 petition under such circumstances. The court found that USCIS's processing, which prioritizes petitions from countries where visas are available or soon to be available and those with previously reviewed projects, operates under a ""rule of reason"" and a ""first-in, first-out"" order. While Congress expressed a ""sense"" that applications should be processed within 180 days, these timelines are ""precatory"" and ""non-binding."" A 29-month delay (including a 9-month lapse in the Regional Center Program's authorization) was not considered an ""unreasonable delay as a matter of law,"" especially given that courts often do not find delays between three to five years unreasonable. Granting relief would also unfairly place the petitioner ""at the head of the queue"" ahead of others who filed earlier, producing no net gain for the agency's competing priorities. Furthermore, alleged harms like investment risk and uncertainty about U.S. residency were deemed ""primarily personal and economic hardships"" not rising to the level of serious ""human health and welfare"" interests, and no bad faith by USCIS was established.",,,,,,,
"An individual's EB-5 visa petition was initially approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) but later revoked. The individual believes the revocation was unlawful and seeks judicial review, asserting that USCIS misinterpreted immigration law and that a recommendation from the Department of State to revoke the petition was also invalid. Can a U.S. federal court review the merits of USCIS's discretionary revocation decision or grant relief based on the State Department's alleged recommendation?","No, a U.S. federal court cannot review the merits of USCIS's decision to revoke an EB-5 visa petition. Congress, through the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), specifically 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) and § 1155, has divested courts of jurisdiction over such decisions, which are deemed ""wholly discretionary."" Section 1155 contains multiple discretionary terms (""may,"" ""at any time,"" and ""for what he deems to be good and sufficient cause""), unambiguously specifying discretion. Attempts to recast the substantive challenge as a procedural one or as presenting a ""predicate legal question"" challenging statutory interpretation are also insufficient to overcome this jurisdictional bar, as these claims ultimately seek review of the agency's assessment of the petition's merits and evidence. Furthermore, the individual lacks standing to sue the Department of State regarding its alleged recommendation, as vacating such a recommendation would not redress the injury; the USCIS revocation would still stand, and the individual would remain ineligible for the EB-5 visa.",,,,,,,
"A couple from Honduras seeks asylum in the U.S., claiming persecution as ""Honduran business owners"" due to gang extortion. They present this argument to the Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), but do not raise any alternative particular social groups or challenge the sufficiency of their initial Notice to Appear. If the BIA rejects the ""Honduran business owners"" particular social group, what would be the likely outcome of a petition for review to the Fifth Circuit regarding their asylum and withholding of removal claims, and any new arguments they attempt to raise on review?","The Fifth Circuit would likely deny the petition for review. The court agrees with the Board of Immigration Appeals that ""business owner"" is not an immutable trait and therefore not a cognizable particular social group under immigration laws. Since a particular social group is an essential element for asylum and withholding of removal claims, the petitioners cannot succeed on either claim based on this proposed group. Furthermore, the court would decline to consider any new arguments, such as an alternative particular social group based on family status, challenges to policy changes, or the sufficiency of their initial Notices to Appear, because these arguments were not presented to the BIA and thus not administratively exhausted, as required by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1). Defects in the initial Notice to Appear regarding the date and time of the initial hearing do not affect the IJ's or BIA's jurisdiction.",,,,,,,
"I was convicted of an aggravated felony in Louisiana as a first-time offender and received an automatic first-offender pardon after completing my sentence. Does this type of pardon qualify as a ""full and unconditional executive pardon"" under federal immigration regulations, allowing me to demonstrate good moral character for naturalization purposes despite my aggravated felony conviction?","No, the court affirmed the denial of naturalization, holding that Louisiana's automatic first-offender pardon is not a ""full and unconditional executive pardon"" as required by 8 C.F.R. § 316.10. The court reasoned that Louisiana state law does not consider an automatic first-offender pardon to restore a ""status of innocence,"" unlike a gubernatorial pardon, making USCIS’s interpretation permissible.",,,,,,,
"A U.S. healthcare provider, ""HealthFirst Medical,"" filed a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' (USCIS) partial denial of an H-1B nonimmigrant visa petition for Dr. Anya Sharma, a citizen of India, who was seeking to change her status from J-2 to H-1B. USCIS approved Dr. Sharma for H-1B classification but denied the domestic change-of-status request, requiring her to travel abroad. After HealthFirst filed suit, Dr. Sharma traveled outside the United States, obtained an H-1B visa, and reentered the U.S. as an H-1B nonimmigrant. HealthFirst also seeks a declaratory judgment challenging USCIS's alleged ""H-4 only"" policy for J-2 dependents, claiming it continues to negatively impact their ability to hire J-2 spouses in the future. HealthFirst asserts it will continue to file such petitions but has not identified any specific future J-2 candidates it wishes to hire. Can HealthFirst's lawsuit proceed?","No, HealthFirst's lawsuit cannot proceed. The challenge to the specific denial of the change-of-status request for Dr. Sharma is moot because Dr. Sharma has already obtained her H-1B visa, rendering it impossible to grant effective relief for that particular claim. Furthermore, HealthFirst lacks standing to challenge USCIS's alleged underlying policy because its prospective injury is insufficiently concrete and imminent, as it has only alleged ""some day"" intentions to file future change-of-status petitions for J-2 nonimmigrants without any description of concrete plans or specific candidates.",,,,,,,
"An undocumented immigrant, Mr. Garcia, received a Notice to Appear (NTA) from the Department of Homeland Security in 2020 that charged him with removability but did not specify the date or time of his initial hearing. Mr. Garcia applied for cancellation of removal, arguing that his U.S. citizen child, who suffers from a severe, rare medical condition requiring ongoing specialized treatment, would face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if he were removed. He also sought administrative closure while pursuing a U visa. The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied cancellation of removal, finding Mr. Garcia failed to establish the requisite hardship and good moral character, and did not rule on the motion for administrative closure. On appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), Mr. Garcia argued the NTA was deficient, depriving the agency of jurisdiction or, alternatively, constituting a claim-processing error. He also challenged the IJ's hardship finding and reiterated his request for administrative closure. After the BIA dismissed his appeal, his U visa application was denied, and he was subsequently removed. Can Mr. Garcia successfully challenge the BIA's decision regarding the NTA deficiency, the hardship finding for cancellation of removal, or the denial of administrative closure?","No, Mr. Garcia cannot successfully challenge the BIA's decision on these grounds.
1.  **NTA Deficiency:** The omission of time and place information from a Notice to Appear (NTA) does not deprive the Immigration Judge of subject-matter jurisdiction over removal proceedings. Furthermore, an objection to a noncompliant NTA is a claim-processing rule that is waived or forfeited if not timely raised by the closing of pleadings before the IJ.
2.  **Exceptional Hardship for Cancellation of Removal:** While the application of the ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" standard is a mixed question of law and fact reviewable by the court, the agency's underlying factual findings are unreviewable. Taking the agency's factual findings as conclusive (unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary), such as the availability of transportation for medical appointments, sufficient involvement by the other parent, and adequate financial support, the agency did not err in determining that Mr. Garcia's removal would not result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his qualifying relative. The agency's no-hardship finding is dispositive, making it unnecessary to reach any flaws in a moral-character analysis.
3.  **Administrative Closure:** Mr. Garcia's claim that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion for administrative closure or a continuance has been mooted by the denial of his U visa application and his subsequent removal from the United States, as it is impossible for the court to grant him any effectual relief.",,,,,,,
"An individual filed an I-526 petition under the EB-5 Regional Center Program to compel USCIS to adjudicate their application, alleging unreasonable delay. If the statutory authorization for the Regional Center Program expires during the litigation, rendering it impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief, can the court proceed to decide the merits of the case?","No, the court cannot proceed to decide the merits of the case. The complaint must be dismissed as moot because the statutory authorization for the Regional Center Program, upon which the plaintiff's petition relies, has lapsed without reauthorization by Congress. This intervening event makes it impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief, as there is no longer a live case or controversy, and any further processing of the application would not advance the plaintiff's efforts to obtain a Regional Center visa.",,,,,,,
"Under what circumstances can a U.S. federal court compel U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to expedite the adjudication of an I-526 immigrant investor visa petition that has been pending for over four years, where the plaintiff alleges unreasonable delay under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Mandamus Act?","A U.S. federal court would not compel USCIS to expedite an I-526 immigrant investor visa petition that has been pending for over four years if the plaintiff fails to plausibly allege unreasonable delay under the ""TRAC"" factors. In this case, the court found that USCIS's processing system, which includes a ""visa availability approach"" prioritizing applicants from countries with available or soon-to-be-available visas, and a modified ""first-in, first-out"" methodology within queues for specific commercial enterprises, adheres to an ""identifiable rationale"" (TRAC factor 1). Although Congress has expressed a ""sense of Congress"" that applications should be completed within 180 days, this is aspirational and not a binding timeline (TRAC factor 2). The court also considered the approximate 4.3-year delay in light of significant external factors, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic and a nine-month lapse in statutory authorization for the EB-5 program. The plaintiff's alleged harms, described as ""health and human prejudices,"" financial harm, and the inability to acquire lawful permanent residency, were deemed primarily economic and inherent in the immigration process, thus insufficient to weigh TRAC factors 3 and 5 in his favor, especially in the absence of severe health concerns or family separation. Furthermore, compelling USCIS to expedite the plaintiff's petition would simply move him ahead of other similarly situated applicants, interfering with agency priorities and producing no net gain (TRAC factor 4). Lastly, the plaintiff failed to plausibly allege facts supporting agency impropriety, and the nine-month processing pause was compelled by law (TRAC factor 6, which remains neutral in the absence of impropriety). Based on this analysis, the court concluded that the plaintiff failed to adequately allege unreasonable delay and therefore dismissed the complaint.",,,,,,,
"In a case challenging an administrative denial of a visa petition, if a plaintiff seeks discovery to support a claim that the agency impermissibly applied a new policy retroactively, but mischaracterizes this retroactivity claim as a non-Administrative Procedure Act (""APA"") claim, will the court grant the discovery request?","No, the court will deny the motion for discovery because the plaintiff's retroactivity claim, invoking equitable factors from *Retail, Wholesale & Dep’t Store Union, AFL-CIO v. NLRB*, is ultimately founded upon the APA's requirement that agency action not be ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,"" making it subject to the APA's ""record rule."" Since the plaintiff did not argue that any recognized exception to the APA ""record rule"" applies, the discovery request will be denied. However, the denial will be without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to file a new motion for discovery that relies on the correct legal framework of the APA record rule and its exceptions.",,,,,,,
"A private non-profit agency, ""Hope for New Arrivals,"" contracts with the state of ""Frontierland"" to provide social services to refugees using federal funds under a program similar to the Refugee Act. Frontierland's governor, citing unsubstantiated security concerns that refugees from ""Warlordia"" may pose a terrorist threat, instructs the state to withhold reimbursement for services provided by Hope for New Arrivals to any refugee whose country of origin is Warlordia. Federal law, similar to 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(5), mandates that services funded under this program be provided ""without regard to race, religion, nationality, sex, or political opinion."" Hope for New Arrivals sues to prevent the state from withholding funds. Should the court grant a preliminary injunction in favor of Hope for New Arrivals?","Yes, the court should grant the preliminary injunction. The federal law dictates that services funded under the refugee assistance program must be provided ""without regard to race, religion, nationality, sex, or political opinion."" The governor's policy of refusing to reimburse for services to refugees from a specific country, even if purportedly based on security fears, constitutes discrimination on the basis of nationality, which is explicitly forbidden by the federal statute. The governor's fears are presented without evidence and are deemed ""nightmare speculation,"" and state action cannot override federal responsibility for immigration and refugee regulation.",,,,,,,
"An individual in removal proceedings sought cancellation of removal based on the ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" his removal would cause his U.S. citizen child, arguing significant involvement in his child's life and potential emotional, psychological, medical, and financial impacts. He also applied for voluntary departure, but the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) noted inconsistencies in his tax filings, which it referred to as ""tax fraud."" Additionally, he moved for a continuance to await his parents' legal permanent resident status, which would allow him to claim them as additional qualifying relatives for cancellation of removal, but this motion was denied. If he petitions the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, what is the likely outcome regarding each of these issues?","The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals would likely deny the petition regarding the cancellation of removal, dismiss the petition regarding voluntary departure for lack of jurisdiction, and deny the petition regarding the continuance.
1.  **Cancellation of Removal**: The court would agree with the BIA's determination that the emotional, psychological, medical, and financial hardships identified, while unfortunate, are ""common and normal"" consequences of an ordinary removal, and do not demonstrate an ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" substantially different from or beyond what would ordinarily be expected.
2.  **Voluntary Departure**: The court would likely find it lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA’s discretionary decision to deny voluntary departure. The BIA's reference to ""tax fraud"" in relation to misrepresentations on tax filings would be considered a summarization of factual findings concerning credibility and character, rather than a reviewable legal conclusion of criminal tax fraud.
3.  **Continuance**: The court would likely conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in affirming the immigration judge’s denial of the motion for a continuance, as the BIA utilized a ""perceptibl[y rational approach"" in weighing relevant factors.",,,,,,,
"A Salvadoran woman seeks asylum in the U.S., claiming membership in a particular social group defined as ""Salvadoran women in domestic relationships who are unable to leave"" or ""Salvadoran women who are viewed as property by virtue of their position in a domestic relationship,"" based on severe abuse from her ex-partner and the perceived inability of the Salvadoran government to protect her. She also applies for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture. If the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) summarily affirms an Immigration Judge's (IJ) denial of her application, and she appeals to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, what is the likely outcome and the primary legal reasoning?","The petition for review would be denied. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has previously held that circularly defined social groups, such as those proposed by the petitioner, are not cognizable for asylum purposes. Because the proposed social groups—""Salvadoran women in domestic relationships who are unable to leave; or Salvadoran women who are viewed as property by virtue of their position in a domestic relationship""—are nearly identical to those previously rejected as circularly defined by the Fifth Circuit, remanding the case to the Immigration Judge would be futile. The petitioner's failure to brief any CAT-specific arguments on appeal also results in that issue being forfeited.",,,,,,,
"A non-citizen defendant, undocumented since age seven, pleads guilty to reduced drug charges in 2010, receiving a suspended sentence. In 2017, he faces deportation. His immigration attorneys inform him that his conviction makes him ineligible for cancellation of removal and permanently inadmissible to the U.S., which he alleges his trial counsel failed to clearly explain. His Motion for Appropriate Relief (MAR) for ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC) under *Padilla v. Kentucky*, and for his plea not being knowingly and voluntarily entered, is initially denied. After an appellate remand for an evidentiary hearing, the trial court again denies the MAR, concluding there was no prejudice because the defendant was already subject to deportation due to his undocumented status. On appeal, what is the likely ruling and reasoning of the appellate court regarding the trial court's order?","The appellate court would likely vacate the trial court's order in part and remand the case for further proceedings.

The appellate court would find that the trial court failed to make sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law on critical issues. Specifically, the trial court did not address the defendant's claims regarding the loss of eligibility for discretionary cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1) and permanent inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). For cancellation of removal, the trial court failed to make findings on the defendant's physical presence, good moral character, other convictions, or the hardship his removal would cause to his U.S. citizen child, which are all prerequisites for determining the statute's potential availability to the defendant. For both cancellation of removal and inadmissibility, the trial court did not properly evaluate prejudice by determining whether the defendant demonstrated a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial, including evaluating the credibility of his affidavit on this point.

Additionally, the appellate court would rule that the trial court erred by failing to comply with its prior order, which explicitly directed the trial court to resolve ""whether [Defendant’s plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered."" This issue was not addressed at all in the trial court's subsequent order.

The appellate court would, however, agree with the trial court that the specific deportability provision under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (deportation for conviction *after admission*) did not apply, as the defendant was never ""admitted"" to the U.S. Therefore, there could be no deficient performance or prejudice related to counsel's advice regarding that particular statute. An argument regarding mandatory detention under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c)(1)(A) would be deemed abandoned if not presented and discussed in the party's brief on appeal.",,,,,,,
"Maya was arrested and held in the Smith County Jail on state misdemeanor charges. After posting bond for these charges, she was eligible for release. However, the Smith County Sheriff continued to detain Maya based on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer and an administrative arrest warrant (Form I-200) for civil immigration violations. The Smith County Sheriff's office has an active 287(g) agreement with ICE, authorizing its deputies to perform specific immigration enforcement functions. Maya's legal counsel filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in state superior court, arguing that her continued detention by the Sheriff was unlawful because the federal detainer lacked probable cause and the Sheriff lacked state authority to detain her for civil immigration purposes. The petition explicitly mentioned the Sheriff's 287(g) agreement. Should the state superior court grant Maya's request for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus and order her discharge?","No, the state superior court should deny Maya's request for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus and her discharge. While the trial judge has the authority to determine whether it is entitled to act upon the petition, it should summarily deny an application that alleges the petitioner is being held pursuant to an immigration-related arrest warrant or detainer by a sheriff who is a party to a 287(g) agreement with the federal government. The application, by explicitly stating that Maya is being held pursuant to an immigration detainer and I-200 Form, and acknowledging the Sheriff's 287(g) agreement, informs the state court that its state law authority to inquire into the lawfulness of the detention is superseded by federal law. A state court lacks the power to look behind the Sheriff's claim that the petitioner is being held pursuant to a valid immigration-related process under a 287(g) agreement, as the Sheriff is acting as a de facto immigration officer in such circumstances. Challenges to the validity of the immigration process itself are reserved for federal, not state, judicial officials.",,,,,,,
"An immigration advocacy organization and several detained aliens challenge the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) policies regarding in-person hearings and access to counsel, implemented in response to a public health emergency. They seek a temporary restraining order (TRO) arguing these policies violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and the Fifth Amendment right to procedural due process. Will a U.S. federal court likely grant their motion for a TRO?","No, a U.S. federal court will likely deny the motion for a TRO. The plaintiffs failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits, primarily because they did not demonstrate standing, as the individual plaintiffs did not have imminent in-person hearings, and the organizational plaintiffs could not show that judges regularly denied requests for remote appearances or continuances. Moreover, the Immigration and Nationality Act's jurisdiction-channeling provisions likely foreclose access-to-counsel and due process claims, directing such challenges to federal courts of appeals, not district courts. Regarding the APA claims, the court found the challenged policies were not ""final agency action"" because legal consequences flow from individual immigration judge decisions rather than the general policies themselves. The court also determined there was no ""failure-to-act"" claim as plaintiffs could not point to a specific statutory obligation requiring the defendants to take the requested actions, and the defendants' policies were not arbitrary and capricious given the rapidly evolving public health crisis. Furthermore, the plaintiffs did not establish they would suffer imminent irreparable injury, and the balance of equities and public interest did not favor imposing a broad, one-size-fits-all injunctive relief on the government's efforts to manage the immigration system while responding to the pandemic.",,,,,,,
"A U.S. citizen was naturalized by a federal court in 1987 and received a naturalization certificate listing an incorrect birth date. After discovering the error years later, they sought to amend the certificate. Does a federal court have subject matter jurisdiction to modify such a naturalization certificate issued by a court before October 1, 1991, despite the Immigration Act of 1990 transferring naturalization authority to the Attorney General?","Yes, federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction to modify naturalization certificates issued by courts before the Immigration Act of 1990 went into effect on October 1, 1991. Congress preserved this jurisdiction through the uncodified savings clause of the Immigration Act of 1990, and federal courts can consider motions to amend these certificates pursuant to former 8 U.S.C. § 1451(i) (1988).",,,,,,,
"Can an in absentia removal order be rescinded if the initial Notice to Appear (NTA) did not specify the time and date of the immigration hearing, even if a separate Notice of Hearing (NOH) was later sent with that information?","Yes, an in absentia removal order may be rescinded if the initial Notice to Appear did not contain the time and date of the hearing. The Supreme Court's interpretation of 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a) requires a single written notice containing all the required information, including the time and place of the hearing. Therefore, a Notice to Appear that lacks this information cannot be cured by a subsequent Notice of Hearing in the context of rescinding an in absentia removal order.",,,,,,,
"A lawful permanent resident, Juan, was convicted in Arizona for attempted possession of fentanyl for sale, in violation of Arizona Revised Statutes section 13-3407. Fentanyl is a federally controlled substance. Is Juan removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony illicit trafficking offense or a controlled substance violation under U.S. immigration law?","Yes, Juan is removable. Section 13-3407 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, which criminalizes possession of a dangerous drug, is divisible with regard to the specific ""dangerous drug"" involved in a violation. Since fentanyl is a federally controlled substance, a conviction for attempted possession of fentanyl for sale under section 13-3407 renders an alien removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony illicit trafficking offense and a controlled substance violation under sections 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, respectively.",,,,,,,
"An alien investor obtained $500,000 via a personal loan from a third-party, which was then wired to their personal account, converted to U.S. currency, and invested as cash into a new commercial enterprise for an EB-5 visa petition. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) denied the petition, asserting that the invested cash loan proceeds constituted ""indebtedness"" under 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e) and required collateralization by personal assets, which the investor failed to demonstrate. The investor challenges this denial. Based on the ruling in Case_zhang_v_united_states_citizenship_and_immigration_services, should the investor's petition be denied on these grounds?","No, the investor's petition should not be denied on these grounds. The court found that USCIS's interpretation of 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e)—that third-party loan proceeds invested as cash are properly characterized as ""indebtedness"" requiring personal collateralization—is plainly erroneous. The regulation unambiguously defines ""capital"" to include ""cash,"" and the ordinary meaning of ""cash"" encompasses cash loan proceeds. The court clarified that the regulation directs the agency to identify the asset *actually contributed* to the enterprise, which in this scenario is cash. The collateralization requirement for ""indebtedness"" only applies when the investor contributes a promise to pay (indebtedness to the enterprise itself), not when the enterprise receives readily deployable cash. Furthermore, USCIS's interpretation effectively amends the regulation by adding a new requirement for cash investments without proper notice and comment, thus violating the Administrative Procedure Act. Therefore, USCIS's denial of such petitions is arbitrary and capricious, and the denials should be vacated and remanded for reconsideration consistent with this understanding.",,,,,,,
"An individual files a petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) order of removal. Subsequently, the BIA vacates that very order. Does the federal court of appeals retain subject matter jurisdiction over the petition for review?","No, the federal court of appeals does not retain subject matter jurisdiction. Appellate jurisdiction depends on the existence of a final order of removal. When the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) vacates the final order on which the court's jurisdiction depended, that order is no longer final, and thus the statutory basis for jurisdiction is lost, requiring dismissal of the appeal.

"Can an individual seeking Temporary Protected Status (TPS) maintain their continuous physical presence in the United States if they depart for 111 days to visit a sick parent, when their absence is later deemed not to be ""of short duration"" or ""reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose"" by immigration authorities?","No, an individual seeking Temporary Protected Status (TPS) may be found ineligible if their 111-day absence from the United States is determined not to be ""brief, casual, and innocent"" under 8 C.F.R. § 1244.1. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) may conclude that such an absence is not ""of short duration and reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose(s) for the absence,"" especially when considering factors such as the individual quitting their job, a long delay (13 years) in visiting the sick parent after diagnosis, and evidence contradicting the stated imminence of the parent's death.

"An Iranian national applies for an EB-5 immigrant investor visa, claiming to have invested $500,000 from the sale of gold coins, rental income, and her husband's income. Due to sanctions, she used third-party trading companies in Dubai to transfer the funds to the U.S. investment. Her application includes an invoice for the gold coin sale with a discrepancy between ""tomans"" and ""rials"" for the total amount, and she cannot provide direct wire transfer records from her Iranian bank account to the Dubai entities, nor can she get written statements from the individuals who facilitated the transfers due to their refusal. She provides an affidavit explaining the situation and confirming the source of funds. If the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) denies her application based on (1) insufficient documentation of the complete path of funds from her personal account to the Dubai entities and (2) the currency discrepancy in the gold coin sale invoice, and she appeals to a U.S. District Court, how should the court rule?","The court should affirm the AAO's denial of the EB-5 visa application. The AAO was within its discretion to demand evidence tracing the funds from the applicant's bank account to the wiring entities, even if the applicant faced difficulties due to banking restrictions and third-party non-cooperation. The applicant's unsupported affidavit regarding the movement of funds through an unidentified person is insufficient to meet the burden of proof, as the agency relies on the absence of corroborating evidence. Furthermore, the AAO, exercising de novo review, was permitted to identify and base its denial on the currency discrepancy in the gold coin invoice, even if it was not raised in the initial denial, because the inconsistency was present in a document submitted by the applicant herself and did not require the agency to provide an opportunity to rebut derogatory information unknown to the applicant. The court cannot reweigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the agency on factual findings. Since both grounds for the AAO's denial are independent and valid, the agency's action was not arbitrary and capricious.",,,,,,,
"A foreign investor seeks an EB-5 visa through a regional center, proposing to invest $500,000 in a new commercial enterprise (NCE) that will loan funds to multiple job-creating entities (JCEs) for various mining projects in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA). At the time of filing the Form I-526 petition, the investor's business plan and offering memorandum list four potential mining locations, but explicitly state that not all have been formally approved, and alternative or additional projects are unspecified and unapproved if initial projects fall through or require less funding. The plan includes an economic report projecting job creation based on mining expenditures but without specific JCE locations. USCIS denies the petition, citing failure to establish TEA qualification and job creation at the time of filing, and views subsequent clarification of JCE locations as an impermissible material change. Can the investor successfully challenge this denial, arguing that the NCE was clearly intended to operate in a TEA and that their economic report adequately demonstrated job creation potential, irrespective of specific JCE locations at filing?","No, the investor cannot successfully challenge the denial. A U.S. District Court has upheld USCIS's denial of similar EB-5 visa petitions on two independent grounds: (1) failure to establish that the Job Creating Entities (JCEs) were principally doing business in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA) at the time of filing, and (2) failure to establish that the investments would create full-time positions for at least ten qualifying employees at the time of filing. For regional center investments, the ""principally doing business"" requirement applies to the JCEs, not the New Commercial Enterprise (NCE). The Court found it reasonable for USCIS to conclude that the investor failed to meet the TEA requirement because the JCEs were not fully identified or approved at the time of filing, making it impossible to determine if the $500,000 TEA investment threshold was met. Furthermore, changes to JCE locations after filing were deemed impermissible material changes affecting eligibility. Regarding job creation, the Court found that the initial business plan, lacking specified JCE locations, was not sufficiently comprehensive to support a credible economic analysis for prospective job creation at the time of filing. USCIS could not assess the reasonableness of assumptions about the geographic impact of projects without this information. Subsequent economic reports based on later-identified JCEs were also rejected due to the material change doctrine, which requires eligibility to be established at the time of filing.",,,,,,,
"Will a federal court review a challenge to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' (USCIS) 2020 update to its Policy Manual, which added a geographic redeployment requirement for EB-5 visa applications, when no investor applicant has yet been subjected to its application?","No, a federal court will not review such a challenge. The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss based on changed circumstances (mootness), but granted the defendants' motion to dismiss because the plaintiffs' claims were not yet ripe. The court found that further factual development was necessary to determine if the 2020 Update had a binding legal effect, if USCIS had characterized it as binding, or if it had been applied to any party. Additionally, the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate sufficient hardship, as their fears of adverse agency action were too remote, particularly given that the EB-5 Regional Center Program lacked statutory authorization at the time and the regulatory regime was unclear on terminating regional centers based on geographic redeployment.",,,,,,,
"Nikunj Devani, a citizen of India, filed an EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program petition (Form I-526) in October 2019, which USCIS has yet to process. He alleges unreasonable delay, seeking to compel USCIS to adjudicate his petition, despite USCIS's visa availability approach and a 9-month lapse in the Regional Center Program's authorization. Will the court compel USCIS to expedite processing of his I-526 petition, considering the TRAC factors for unreasonable delay?","No, the court will dismiss Devani's action, denying his request to compel USCIS to process his I-526 petition. The court found that Devani failed to state a plausible claim of unreasonable delay under the TRAC factors.
1.  **Rule of Reason & Congressional Timetable:** USCIS's visa availability approach, which processes petitions on a modified ""first-in, first-out"" basis prioritizing petitioners from countries below visa caps, constitutes a rule of reason. Congress has not mandated a binding timeline for I-526 processing; the ""sense of Congress"" resolution is merely hortatory. The effective 32-month delay (accounting for a 9-month lapse in statutory authority) is not unreasonable, especially compared to the current average 52-month processing time for Indian applicants.
2.  **Prejudice to Health, Welfare, and Other Interests:** Devani's alleged financial and immigration-related harms (uncertainty) are considered inherent risks of the I-526 application process and do not rise to the level of harm, such as significant threats to physical health or safety, typically warranting intervention under these factors.
3.  **Agency's Competing Priorities:** Granting relief would require USCIS to reorder its priorities, placing Devani ahead of other similarly situated petitioners in the existing backlog, which the court is hesitant to do.
4.  **Impropriety:** Devani did not plausibly allege any facts of impropriety by USCIS. The 9-month pause in processing was due to a lapse in statutory authorization, not agency misconduct.",,,,,,,
"A U.S. citizen sponsoring an immigrant spouse through a USCIS Form I-864 Affidavit of Support has separated from the spouse. The immigrant spouse seeks damages for breach of the Affidavit of Support, repayment of a personal loan, and attorney's fees. What are the legal obligations of the sponsor regarding the Affidavit of Support, including the relevant household size and income calculations, and what remedies are available for the loan and fees?","The trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the Affidavit of Support claims for all relevant years, as the plaintiff's prayer for relief covered all damages. However, the trial court erred by calculating damages using the 125% Federal Poverty Level (FPL) Guidelines for a two-person household; it should have used the guidelines for a one-person household, as the child was a U.S. citizen and not a sponsored alien. The trial court did not err by calculating the sponsored immigrant's income using Adjusted Gross Income, allowing for the deduction of depreciation expenses.

Regarding the personal loan, the defendant's argument that an implied-in-fact contract existed (instead of a quasi-contract) was waived because it contradicted their position at trial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not crediting the defendant for ""sweat equity"" on other properties when fashioning the equitable remedy for the loan used to purchase the income-producing property. The trial court did err by awarding repayment of the loan in U.S. Dollars (USD) instead of Australian Dollars (AUD); the award must be converted to AUD on remand.

The trial court's decision to hold an additional conference before the final order was entered, and any missing portions of the trial transcript, did not constitute reversible error because the defendant failed to show prejudice. Finally, the trial court did not err by awarding reasonable attorney's fees to the immigrant spouse for prevailing on her Affidavit of Support claims, though the amount may be reconsidered on remand due to the reduction in damages owed.",,,,,,,
"A Canadian resident, identifying as Native American/First Nations, applies for U.S. citizenship, but their application is rejected by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) due to incomplete forms. The individual then asks a U.S. federal district court to directly grant them citizenship, citing Section 289 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. Can the federal court fulfill this request?","No, a U.S. federal district court cannot grant citizenship. Federal courts lack the power to confer citizenship, as this authority rests with Congress alone to prescribe rules for naturalization. Therefore, the court would dismiss a complaint seeking such relief.",,,,,,,
"A Honduran woman and her children seek asylum in the U.S., claiming persecution by gangs on account of their proposed particular social group (""unprotected Honduran women who are unable to protect themselves or their children from Honduran gangs"") and their religious activities. They also argue that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) violated their due process rights by allowing a single BIA member to decide their case without a three-member panel and by not requiring the government to file a brief. Based on *Case_bustamante-leiva_v_garland*, would their petitions for asylum and related relief likely be granted?","No, their petitions for asylum, statutory withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture would likely be denied. The BIA would be upheld in finding that the proposed particular social group lacked the necessary social distinction. The expert testimony indicated that gang violence against women was not perceived as socially distinct from the general phenomenon of gang violence, and any reformulated social groups not raised before the immigration judge would not be considered on appeal. The BIA would also be upheld in finding that the evidence did not compel the conclusion that religion was a central reason for the harm, as it was incidental to economic extortion. Furthermore, the claims regarding a single BIA member's decision not violating due process and the BIA not being required to mandate government briefing would be rejected, as these actions are consistent with regulations and do not demonstrate a lack of impartiality or a due process violation.",,,,,,,
"Under what circumstances, as per the District Court's ruling, can a coalition challenge specific immigration policy changes for lack of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and what types of challenges are generally dismissed?","A coalition can challenge specific immigration policy changes for lack of NEPA review under the APA if at least one plaintiff has constitutional standing and the claims fall within NEPA's zone of interests. For standing, a plaintiff must show a concrete procedural injury under NEPA, impairment of concrete environmental interests (e.g., direct harm to land, disruption of enjoyment), causation (a demonstrable increase in risk to particularized interests due to non-compliance), and redressability (the court ordering the agency to undertake the procedure could mitigate harm). The alleged injuries must have a sufficiently close connection to the physical environment.

However, challenges are dismissed if they are:
1.  **To an agency's NEPA instruction manual:** Such a manual is not considered ""final agency action"" under the APA if it is not the consummation of the agency’s decision-making process and does not create new legal obligations or impose legal consequences.
2.  **A broad ""programmatic"" challenge:** The APA limits review to ""discrete"" agency actions, precluding broad programmatic attacks that lump together numerous diffuse policy changes without identifying a single order, regulation, or completed universe of orders and regulations.
3.  **Barred by specific statutory schemes:** While challenges to generally applicable rules or policies regarding immigration (like administrative closure or rescission of certain ""Remain in Mexico"" policies) are reviewable, challenges to individual orders of removal or actions committed to agency discretion by law are generally not. The court specifically noted that INA provisions channeling review of removal orders to circuit courts do not bar challenges to the lack of NEPA analysis for general policy changes.

Specific immigration policy changes that survived dismissal in this case for potential NEPA review include:
*   Ending construction of the southern border wall.
*   Terminating ""Remain in Mexico"" policies (Migrant Protection Protocols, Asylum Cooperative Agreements, Prompt Asylum Claim Review, Humanitarian Asylum Review Process).
*   Allowing border patrol agents to grant permission for aliens to stay and helping them board buses.
*   Preventing immigration officials from detaining and removing aliens (challenging the general policy, not individual decisions).
*   Ending the practice of fining aliens for failing to leave the country (challenging the general policy).
*   Reinstating administrative closure in immigration courts.
*   Expanding various refugee programs (challenging the Department of State's actions to resettle refugees, specifically its requests for proposals and awards to grantees, rather than the Presidential refugee admission ceiling).",,,,,,,
"A noncitizen defendant seeks to withdraw a guilty plea, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to advise him of the adverse immigration consequences, specifically that relief under INA Section 212(c) was unavailable. The defendant states in an affidavit that he would not have pleaded guilty if he had known this. The trial court also provided a general advisement under R.C. 2943.031. The defendant had strong ties to the U.S. and faced severe charges, but also had potential grounds for dismissal or acquittal. Under these circumstances, would the defendant's motion to withdraw the guilty plea due to ineffective assistance of counsel likely be granted based on a showing of prejudice?","No, the defendant's motion to withdraw the guilty plea would likely not be granted. To establish prejudice for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the plea context, the defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. In this situation, the defendant's affidavit alone is insufficient without contemporaneous evidence to substantiate that avoiding deportation was the determinative issue. The record lacks evidence of the defendant's motivations beyond the affidavit, especially since counsel invoked attorney-client privilege. Furthermore, despite receiving advice that relief under Section 212(c) was discretionary and not assured, the defendant still pleaded guilty to a deportable offense. The trial court also provided a statutory advisement about potential deportation consequences, and there is no indication the defendant misunderstood it. Finally, the defendant faced significantly harsher consequences (18 felony counts, including first-degree rape, with potential life sentences and firearm specifications) by going to trial compared to the plea agreement (sexual battery and attempted abduction with suspended sentences and probation), making the decision to plead guilty appear rational. Therefore, prejudice is not demonstrated.",,,,,,,
"If an individual files a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for ""all documents reflecting statistics"" about a government program, can the agency fulfill that request by creating and providing a new statistical table, or is it obligated to search for and disclose preexisting internal documents that contain or reflect such statistics?","An agency generally cannot fulfill a FOIA request for ""all documents reflecting statistics"" by unilaterally creating and providing a new statistical table. A request for ""documents"" is reasonably understood as one for preexisting internal agency records, not newly generated summaries. An adequate FOIA search must be performed in good faith and reasonably designed to uncover the requested records. If a requester objects to a newly generated table and reiterates their request for ""ALL documents"" (including internal reports and emails), the agency is obligated to search for records in the form specified in the initial request. Furthermore, the risk of ""additional confusion"" is not a legitimate basis for refusing to perform a FOIA search for internal documents. If an initial FOIA request is deemed unclear or unwieldy, the agency has a duty to construe it liberally and clarify it with the requester.",,,,,,,
"A U.S. citizen, naturalized by USCIS after October 1, 1991, discovers an incorrect birth date on their naturalization certificate due to an error on their original foreign birth certificate, which has since been corrected. Can this citizen rely on 8 C.F.R. § 334.16(b) or 28 U.S.C. § 1331 to establish federal district court jurisdiction to order USCIS to amend their naturalization certificate?","No, a federal district court cannot exercise jurisdiction to order USCIS to amend the naturalization certificate for a person who was naturalized by executive action (USCIS) after October 1, 1991. Congress explicitly withdrew jurisdiction over naturalizations from the district courts with limited exceptions not applicable here. Furthermore, 8 C.F.R. § 334.16(b) does not provide a colorable claim for such relief because it applies only to judicial naturalizations where a court took final action, and it cannot create a private right of action that Congress has not created through statutory text. The general grant of federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 is superseded by the specific statutory withdrawal of jurisdiction over post-1991 naturalization matters from district courts.",,,,,,,

Are they barred from eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal under the persecutor bar, and who bears the burden of proof regarding the applicability of this bar?","No, the individual is barred from eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. The persecutor bar does not include an exception for coercion or duress. Furthermore, the Department of Homeland Security does not have an evidentiary burden to show that an applicant is ineligible under the persecutor bar. If evidence in the record indicates that the persecutor bar may apply, the applicant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it does not.",,,,,,,
"An individual, a native of Tanzania, entered the U.S. on a student visa and subsequently married a U.S. citizen. This marriage was later annulled, but before the annulment, the U.S. citizen spouse filed an I-130 petition on the individual's behalf, which was later denied due to the U.S. citizen spouse's fraudulent multiple marriages. The individual then married a second U.S. citizen, claiming battery and extreme cruelty, and filed an I-360 self-petition. The USCIS and AAO denied this I-360 petition, citing the previous marriage as fraudulent under Section 204(c) and also finding a failure to prove good faith in the second marriage. The individual appeals, arguing that the annulment means the first marriage never existed and that the previous I-130 denial should not apply to the current I-360 petition. Is the agency's decision to deny the I-360 petition, based on the prior fraudulent marriage and lack of good faith in the second marriage, arbitrary or capricious?","No, the agency's decision to deny the I-360 petition was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The court found that there was more than enough evidence to support the conclusion that the plaintiff and his first U.S. citizen spouse did not marry in good faith, given the spouse's conviction for marriage fraud involving five marriages. The fact that the plaintiff obtained an annulment did not establish his intent at the time of the marriage. Therefore, the I-360 petition was properly denied because the plaintiff had previously sought immediate relative status based on a marriage determined to be for the purpose of evading immigration laws, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c). Additionally, the court found an independent basis for denial: the plaintiff failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he entered into his second marriage in good faith, as required for the I-360 petition, having provided limited probative details beyond the abuse he sustained.",,,,,,,
"In an Administrative Procedure Act (APA) challenge to the denial of an I-129 immigration petition by USCIS, where the plaintiffs reside in Washington and the petition was adjudicated by a USCIS service center in California, can the case initially filed in the District of Columbia be transferred to another district, and what factors guide such a transfer decision?","Yes, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia can transfer such a case to another district, specifically to the Central District of California, based on the court's authority under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) for the ""convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice.""

The court's decision is guided by a two-fold inquiry:
1.  **Could the case have been brought in the transferee district?** Yes, both the Central District of California (where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred, as the USCIS California Service Center adjudicated the petition) and the Western District of Washington (where the plaintiffs reside) are proper venues under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).
2.  **Do private and public interests favor transfer?** The court found that these interests largely weigh in favor of transfer to the Central District of California.
    *   **Preferred forum:** While plaintiffs preferred D.C., the deference to their choice was lessened because D.C. is not their home forum and lacks meaningful ties to the controversy. The USCIS headquarters had relocated from D.C., and the remaining D.C. offices were not involved in the petition's adjudication.
    *   **Location where the claim arose:** The claim arose in the Central District of California, where the challenged federal action (the petition denial) occurred, supporting the local interest in deciding controversies at home.
    *   **Convenience:** The Central District of California is the more convenient forum as the field office most familiar with the facts of the application is located there, and any relief granted would apply to officials in that district.
    *   **Relative congestion of the courts and familiarity with governing law:** These factors were considered neutral, as statistics on congestion were mixed, and all federal judges are presumed familiar with federal laws, including immigration disputes and the APA.

Consequently, the court granted the motion to transfer the case to the Central District of California and did not address the defendant's motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction or improper venue.",,,,,,,
"If an individual receives a Notice to Appear (NTA) for removal proceedings that does not initially specify the time and place of the hearing, and they subsequently apply for cancellation of removal based on hardship to their children, can they challenge the validity of the NTA in federal court and appeal the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) finding that their children would not face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship?","No, an individual in this situation would likely not succeed in challenging the NTA's validity or appealing the hardship determination.
Regarding the NTA, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that an NTA which does not list the time and place of the initial hearing is not defective as a valid charging document, because regulations (8 C.F.R. § 1003.18(b)), not the statute (8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)), govern what an NTA must contain, and subsequent notices can cure any deficiency by providing the required information. The court found this argument foreclosed by its own binding circuit precedent.
Regarding the hardship determination, the court explicitly stated it lacked jurisdiction to review the BIA's finding that removal would not cause exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the individual's children. This jurisdictional bar is imposed by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) and was clarified by the Supreme Court in *Patel v. Garland*, which held that such hardship determinations are discretionary and authoritative decisions beyond federal court review.",,,,,,,
"Does a plaintiff's complaint alleging an unreasonable delay by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in adjudicating an EB-5 immigrant investor visa petition, and by the FBI in completing associated background checks, state a plausible claim for relief under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) or the Mandamus Act, particularly when the government asserts a ""visa availability approach"" as its processing rationale?","No, the plaintiff's Amended Complaint fails to state a plausible claim of unreasonable delay under the APA or the Mandamus Act. The Court, applying the six TRAC factors, found that while the second factor (Congressional timetable) might weigh in the plaintiff's favor due to the processing time exceeding 180 days, the remaining factors—including the ""rule of reason"" governing the Government’s processing of I-526 petitions, the absence of justification for expediting the plaintiff’s petition over other similarly situated petitioners, and the lack of alleged harm to health or welfare—favor the Government. Therefore, the complaint does not state a claim for unreasonable delay.",,,,,,,
"In a child custody dispute where one parent has been deported due to alleged domestic violence, can a U.S. federal court order the children to travel abroad to visit the deported parent, even if the other parent fears for her safety and that of the children if they were to leave the U.S.?","Yes, a U.S. federal court can order children to travel abroad for visitation with a deported parent if the trial court finds that the deported parent is not an unfit caregiver and that in-person contact is in the children's best interest. Such an order is permissible, particularly when the deported parent's inability to enter the United States makes international travel the only reasonable option for visitation. The court must consider all relevant factors, including acts of domestic violence between the parties, the safety of the child, and the safety of either party. However, specific statutory language regarding a party's absence or relocation due to domestic violence will not be applied if that party has not, in fact, relocated or been absent for that reason. Electronic communication may supplement but not replace in-person visitation.",,,,,,,
"An individual, who is a lawful permanent resident (LPR), applies for naturalization. During the review, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) discovers that the individual's original application for LPR status contained a material misrepresentation, specifically omitting a prior marriage. The individual contends that this omission was an attorney's inadvertent error, not fraudulent or willful, and that they were not otherwise inadmissible on the true facts. Based on this discovery, USCIS denies the naturalization application, concluding the individual was not ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence."" Is the individual eligible for naturalization?","No, the individual is not eligible for naturalization. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirms that an individual is not ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence"" if their application for adjustment to LPR status contained a material misrepresentation, even if the misrepresentation was not fraudulent or willful, and even if the individual believes they would not have been inadmissible on the true facts. This is because the application, containing a material misrepresentation, did not comply with 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(a)(2), which requires all information to be ""true and correct."" Failure to be lawfully admitted for permanent residence is a statutory bar to naturalization.",,,,,,,
"If the Secretary of Homeland Security revokes an approved visa petition under 8 U.S.C. § 1155 for what they deem to be good and sufficient cause, can the affected individual seek judicial review of that revocation decision in a U.S. federal court?","No, a U.S. federal court lacks jurisdiction to review such a decision. The Secretary of Homeland Security's decision to revoke a visa petition authorized by 8 U.S.C. § 1155 is discretionary, and pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), Congress has removed federal courts' jurisdiction to review such discretionary actions.",,,,,,,
"An individual facing a deportation order, whose claims for U-visa waitlist eligibility and employment authorization adjudication have been dismissed by a federal district court, seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent removal while awaiting a decision on their U-visa application, and also has remaining claims challenging the agency's failure to issue interim work authorization documents. The individual subsequently receives employment authorization through an unrelated process. Does the district court have jurisdiction to grant the preliminary injunction, and are the remaining interim work authorization claims moot?","No, the district court lacks jurisdiction to grant a preliminary injunction staying removal. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) divests district courts of jurisdiction to stay or enjoin removal orders, restricting such challenges to petitions filed with the appropriate court of appeals. Furthermore, the preliminary injunction request was untethered to any remaining claims, as the U-visa waitlist claims had been dismissed. Even if jurisdiction existed, the plaintiff failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits for forestalling removal. Yes, the remaining claims concerning interim work authorization are moot because the plaintiff subsequently received employment authorization documents, thereby obtaining all the specific relief sought for those claims.",,,,,,,
"Under FOIA, can the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) withhold the names, genders, and work locations of immigration judges from complaint records, redact information about other complaints as ""non-responsive"" from a specific complaint file, and decline to proactively publish immigration judge complaint resolutions?","The Court ruled that EOIR can withhold the names, genders, and work locations of individual immigration judges from complaint records under FOIA Exemption 6, finding that these non-supervisory, career civil servants retain privacy rights that outweigh the incremental public interest in revealing their identities. However, EOIR cannot redact information from complaint files as ""non-responsive"" if that information concerns other complaints against the same immigration judge or other immigration judges, as such material falls within the scope of a request for all complaints and their resolutions. Finally, EOIR is not required to proactively publish immigration judge complaint resolutions under FOIA Section 552(a)(2)(A), because these resolutions are not the result of an adversarial process and do not carry the force of law, thus not constituting ""final opinions"" or ""orders.""",,,,,,,
"Can a U.S. lawful permanent resident successfully sue the U.S. State Department for unreasonable delay in processing an immigrant visa for their spouse under the Administrative Procedure Act, or for violating their Fifth Amendment due process rights, given a processing delay of under two years exacerbated by a global pandemic?","No, a U.S. lawful permanent resident cannot successfully sue the U.S. State Department for unreasonable delay or Fifth Amendment due process violations under these circumstances.

The Court dismissed the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claim for unreasonable delay because:
1.  The State Department's practice of processing visa applications on a first-in, first-out basis is considered a ""rule of reason"" for decision-making, and Congress has not established a specific statutory timetable for visa processing.
2.  A delay of approximately fourteen months (less than two years) is not deemed unreasonable as a matter of law, especially given the extraordinary backlog of cases (increasing from approximately 75,000 to 473,000) and the disruption to services caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.
3.  Granting relief would place the plaintiff ahead of other similarly situated applicants, interfering with the State Department's allocation of resources and its prioritization of ""mission critical"" functions during the pandemic.
4.  The plaintiff's broad allegations regarding the delay's toll on his physical and mental health and the harm to his family were insufficient to meet the criteria for human health and welfare or other interests prejudiced by the delay.
5.  No impropriety or bad faith on the part of the agency was alleged.
Consequently, the mandamus action based on the APA claim also failed.

The Court dismissed the Fifth Amendment due process claims (both substantive and procedural) because:
1.  There is no fundamental liberty interest in having a spouse's visa application granted or processed more quickly, as admission of aliens to the United States is a privilege granted by the sovereign, not a right. The Supreme Court precedent, such as *Kerry v. Din*, explicitly forecloses such a substantive due process argument.
2.  Since there is no protected liberty or property interest at stake in an immigrant visa and a process governed by a rule of reason exists for applicants, there can be no procedural due process violation.
The plaintiff's equal protection claim, also a Fifth Amendment claim, was dismissed as a matter of law for similar reasons.

Claims against the DHS defendants were dismissed as moot because the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) had already approved the I-130 petition and transferred it to the National Visa Center, completing its role in the process. Additionally, claims concerning the Controlled Application Review and Resolution Program (CARRP) were dismissed as moot against DHS and constitutionally unripe against the State Department, as CARRP is a DHS policy.",,,,,,,
"An EB-5 investor, John, filed a Form I-526 petition based on an investment in a limited partnership that included a ""Call Option"" allowing the general partner to repurchase John's interest for a fixed amount if the business was successful. USCIS denied John's petition, stating the Call Option meant his capital was not ""at risk"" and was a ""guaranteed return."" Concurrently, other investors in the same partnership, who submitted functionally identical petitions, received different denial notices from USCIS, citing various other reasons or fewer reasons for denial, with no explanation for the varied treatment. If John challenges USCIS's decision under the Administrative Procedure Act, what is the likely outcome regarding the ""at risk"" determination and the disparate treatment of petitions?","The court would likely find that USCIS's reasoning in denying John's petition on the grounds that the Call Option made his capital not ""at risk"" and constituted a ""guaranteed return"" was arbitrary and capricious, as the Call Option did not guarantee the return of capital regardless of the business's success or failure, nor did it provide the investor with any rights to exercise it. Additionally, the court would likely find that USCIS acted arbitrarily and capriciously by issuing different denial notices with varying reasons to functionally equivalent petitions without providing any explanation for the disparate treatment. The appropriate remedy would be to remand John's petition to USCIS for reconsideration consistent with the court's opinion, requiring USCIS to either treat all similar petitions in the same manner or sufficiently explain any reasons for treating them differently. The court would not likely order John's petition granted at this stage.",,,,,,,
A Minnesota county's jail receives an immigration detainer from U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) for an individual who has completed their state-level sentence and is scheduled for release. The detainer requests that the jail hold the individual for up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled release time so ICE can assume custody. Can the Minnesota county lawfully comply with this detainer request?,"No, a Minnesota county cannot lawfully hold an individual based solely on an immigration detainer if that person would otherwise be released from custody. The continued detention of a person who would otherwise be released from custody constitutes an arrest. Neither Minnesota law nor federal law grants state and local officials the authority to make such an arrest based on an immigration detainer.",,,,,,,

Prior to coming to the U.S., Country Y offered them permanent resident status through a humanitarian program, requiring registration, an application, and a fee.

Can the asylum seeker be barred from asylum in the U.S. based on firm resettlement in Country Y, given their reasons for not accepting the offer?","Yes, the asylum seeker can be barred from asylum. For purposes of determining whether an alien is subject to the firm resettlement bar to asylum, a viable and available offer to apply for permanent residence in a country of refuge is not negated by the alien’s unwillingness or reluctance to satisfy the terms for acceptance, nor by allowing their qualifications for permanent residence to lapse or purposefully becoming ineligible.

"A federal court of appeals is reviewing an appeal of a removal order. During the appeal process, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) vacates the original removal order. What is the proper basis for the court of appeals to dismiss the appeal?","The proper basis for the court of appeals to dismiss the appeal is that the vacatur of the original removal order by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) removes the existence of a final order of removal, thereby eliminating the court's subject matter jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(1). Defects in subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time during the proceedings.",,,,,,,
"Under North Carolina law, can a trial court order a custodial parent to send children to a foreign country for visitation with a non-custodial parent who has been deported, particularly when there is a history of domestic violence against the custodial parent and concerns about the children's immigration status?","Yes, a North Carolina trial court can order children to travel to a foreign country for visitation with a non-custodial parent who has been deported, even with a history of domestic violence against the custodial parent and immigration concerns. A court cannot deny a parent reasonable visitation unless it makes a written finding that the parent is unfit or that visitation is not in the best interest of the child. If the court finds the deported parent is not unfit and visitation is in the children's best interest, and the parent is unable to enter the United States, then visitation in the foreign country may be deemed the only reasonable visitation available. The trial court must consider all relevant factors, including acts of domestic violence, the safety of the child, and the safety of either party from domestic violence, and support its determination with written findings of fact. A statutory provision that prevents a party's absence or relocation due to domestic violence from weighing against them in custody determinations does not apply to the custodial parent's fear of future relocation to the foreign country for visitation.",,,,,,,
"An individual seeking cancellation of removal was convicted in California under Penal Code § 245(a)(4) for assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. The individual argues this conviction is not a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT). Separately, the individual filed a motion to terminate removal proceedings, claiming the initial Notice to Appear was defective for lacking a time and date, even though a subsequent Notice of Hearing provided this information and the individual appeared at all scheduled hearings. Additionally, the individual challenges the denial of voluntary departure. How would a U.S. federal court decide these arguments?","The court would rule that a conviction for assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury under California Penal Code § 245(a)(4) is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude, rendering the individual statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal. The motion to terminate removal proceedings would be denied because an Immigration Judge has jurisdiction over proceedings when an initial Notice to Appear, even if defective for lacking a time or date, is cured by a later-served Notice of Hearing specifying that information, and no due process violation was demonstrated as the individual appeared for all scheduled hearings. For the challenge to the denial of voluntary departure, the record would be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further factual findings regarding the favorable and unfavorable factors relevant to that discretionary determination.",,,,,,,
"A North Carolina resident is arrested by local law enforcement on state charges and placed in the county jail. After these state charges are dismissed, the Sheriff continues to hold the individual based solely on an immigration detainer and arrest warrant issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Sheriff's office has a 287(g) agreement with ICE, authorizing deputies to perform immigration enforcement functions. The resident files a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in state superior court, arguing that their continued detention is unlawful and that the immigration process is invalid. Does the state superior court have the authority to grant the habeas corpus petition and order the resident's release?","No. The North Carolina Supreme Court has held that if an application for a writ of habeas corpus alleges that the petitioner is being held pursuant to an immigration-related arrest warrant or detainer by a sheriff who is a party to a 287(g) agreement with the federal government, the state trial court must summarily deny the application. If the application does not initially reveal this, but the sheriff's return claims the petitioner is held under such federal authority via a 287(g) agreement, the trial court must then deny the request for discharge. State courts lack the authority to inquire into the validity of federal immigration processes or to interfere with detentions made under a 287(g) agreement, as such matters fall under exclusive federal jurisdiction. The remedy for any alleged unlawful imprisonment in these circumstances lies exclusively with federal courts.",,,,,,,
"A lawful permanent resident, who is a non-English speaker with significant ties to his country of origin, pleads guilty to an aggravated felony that mandates deportation. His attorney did not explicitly advise him of the mandatory deportation consequences, and he did not request an interpreter during the plea hearing. He claims he did not fully understand the proceedings and that avoiding deportation was his primary concern, despite telling the judge at the time of the plea that he understood the potential for deportation. The trial court advised him of the possibility of deportation as required by statute, and he responded affirmatively when asked if he understood. He seeks to withdraw his plea four years later, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel and a violation of his right to an interpreter. Should the trial court grant his motion to withdraw his guilty plea?","No. A trial court should not grant a post-sentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea unless the defendant demonstrates a ""manifest injustice,"" a showing that rests on the defendant to prove extraordinary circumstances. To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must show both that counsel's performance was deficient and that, but for counsel's errors, there is a reasonable probability the result of the proceeding would have been different (prejudice). Here, even assuming counsel was deficient in not explicitly advising on mandatory deportation, the defendant could not demonstrate prejudice. Factors weighing against a finding of prejudice include: (1) Strong evidence of guilt presented by the State (video, witnesses); (2) The defendant's stated primary goal at the time of the plea was to receive probation, not to avoid deportation; (3) The defendant was aware of an ICE detainer prior to entering his plea, making his assertion of unawareness of deportation consequences not credible; (4) The defendant's limited ties to the United States and strong ties to his country of origin (unemployed, did not reside with his U.S. citizen wife, child in Haiti, only intended a brief vacation); (5) The trial court properly advised the defendant, pursuant to R.C. 2943.031(A), that his conviction could result in deportation, exclusion, or denial of naturalization, and the defendant acknowledged understanding this advisement without asking questions; (6) The defendant acknowledged reviewing and understanding the plea form, which stated his understanding of consequences for non-U.S. citizens; and (7) An unreasonable delay of four years in filing the motion to withdraw the plea. Regarding the interpreter claim, the trial court made adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law, noting the defendant's demonstrated proficiency in English during various proceedings (responding appropriately to questions, writing his version of events, communicating with probation officers without an interpreter) and that he never requested an interpreter.",,,,,,,
"A U.S. citizen sponsors his alien spouse for immigration by signing a USCIS Form I-864 Affidavit of Support.

The couple later separates, and the sponsored spouse seeks monetary damages from the sponsor for breach of the Affidavit of Support. When calculating the sponsor's obligation, what household size should the court use for the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) Guidelines, and if the spouse also loaned the sponsor money in a foreign currency, in what currency should the repayment be awarded?","The court erred by using the FPL Guidelines for a two-person household. The sponsor only promised to support the alien spouse in the Affidavit of Support, and the U.S. citizen child was not listed on the form as an immigrant intended to be sponsored, as the Affidavit of Support does not apply to U.S. citizens. Therefore, the court should calculate the damages using the FPL Guidelines for a one-person household. For example, for 2016, if the one-person FPL Guideline was $14,850 and the spouse's adjusted gross income was $8,511, the damages would be $6,339. The court did not err by deducting depreciation expenses from the spouse's adjusted gross income when calculating damages.

Regarding the loan, as the spouse loaned and paid the sponsor in Australian Dollars (AUD), the interest was repaid in AUD, and the spouse's loss occurred in AUD, the court erred by awarding equitable relief payable in U.S. Dollars (USD). On remand, the trial court must correct and convert the spouse's equitable award and any interest thereon to be repayable in AUD for any outstanding balance. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not crediting the sponsor with any purported ""sweat equity"" for repairing other properties. The trial court's award of reasonable attorney's fees to the spouse for claims of breach of the Affidavit of Support is affirmed, but the amount may be reconsidered upon remand.",,,,,,,
"Can a generalized bachelor's degree in Business Administration satisfy the ""specific specialty"" requirement for a ""specialty occupation"" H-1B visa petition under 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(1)(B) and 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(ii)?","No, a generalized bachelor's degree in Business Administration is not considered a ""specific specialty"" and therefore does not satisfy the requirements for a ""specialty occupation"" H-1B visa petition. USCIS's interpretation that the degree must be ""in a specific specialty that is directly related to the proffered position"" is consistent with the statute. The court affirmed that a business administration degree is a ""general-purpose degree"" that does not establish a position as a specialty occupation because its broad coverage of fields like Contract Negotiations, Managerial Finance, Human Resource Management, and Strategic Planning is not sufficiently specialized.",,,,,,,
"A Palestinian asylum seeker, residing in Virginia, initially filed an action against USCIS in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to compel adjudication of his applications. USCIS, headquartered in Maryland, moved to transfer the case to the Eastern District of Virginia or dismiss it for improper venue. The plaintiff countered, requesting a transfer to the District of Maryland if D.C. was found to be an improper venue, citing his counsel's bar admissions and USCIS's location. Given these circumstances, to which district should the court transfer the case?","The court should transfer the case to the District of Maryland. The District of Columbia is not a proper venue because USCIS does not reside there, the events giving rise to the claim (application filings and delays) occurred in Virginia, and the plaintiff resides in Virginia. Although the Eastern District of Virginia would also be a proper venue as the plaintiff resides there and the claim arose there, the court decided to transfer to the District of Maryland. This decision was based on the convenience of the parties and the interests of justice, considering that USCIS resides in Maryland, and the plaintiff's current counsel is barred in D.C. and Maryland but not in Virginia, thereby avoiding significant inconvenience and expense for the plaintiff.",,,,,,,
"In a motion for attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), what level of evidence is required to establish a party's net worth, particularly when the administrative record contains information suggesting a higher net worth than a bare affidavit attests?","To receive an EAJA fee award, a party must demonstrate that their net worth did not exceed $2,000,000 at the time the civil action was filed. While an affidavit alone may sometimes be sufficient, courts must assess the entire record to determine if the net worth requirement is met, especially when the record contains significant information about the party's financial situation. The party seeking the award bears the burden of proof and must show that their testimony is consistent with the balance of the record. Therefore, a bare assertion in an affidavit, made under penalty of perjury, that one's net worth has never exceeded the threshold is insufficient if other record evidence raises concerns about its accuracy or if the party fails to provide documentation regarding the value of their assets and liabilities. In such a situation, the court may deny that part of the motion without prejudice and order supplemental briefing to provide the necessary documentation.",,,,,,,
"A U.S. citizen, convicted of specified offenses against a minor, filed a Form I-130 Petition for Alien Relative on behalf of his spouse. The USCIS denied the petition, concluding in its ""sole and unreviewable discretion"" that the citizen failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt he posed no risk to his spouse, as required by the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. The citizen and his spouse then sued in federal district court, alleging the denial was arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and violated their due process and right to marry. Does the district court have subject matter jurisdiction to review the USCIS's discretionary ""no-risk"" determination, even when the plaintiffs characterize their claims as legal and constitutional issues?","No, the district court does not have subject matter jurisdiction to review the USCIS's discretionary ""no-risk"" determination. The Immigration and Nationality Act, specifically 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(A)(viii)(I), grants USCIS ""sole and unreviewable discretion"" in making this determination. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), no court has jurisdiction to review such discretionary decisions. While 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D) permits judicial review of constitutional claims or legal questions, this exception applies only when ""raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals"" during removal proceedings, which is not the case here. Therefore, the district court correctly concluded it lacked jurisdiction.",,,,,,,
"Maria, a Mexican citizen, entered the United States on a TD visa, which required her to maintain a foreign residence and not intend to establish permanent residence. She later began the process of seeking lawful permanent resident status through a Petition for Alien Relative filed by her U.S. citizen sister. While this petition was pending, she filed for dissolution of her marriage in an Arizona court. The trial court dismissed her petition, ruling that her TD visa status, and the federal law associated with it, legally precluded her from establishing domicile in Arizona. Is the trial court's dismissal of her divorce petition on the basis of federal preemption correct?","No, the trial court's dismissal of Maria's divorce petition based on federal preemption is incorrect. The Arizona Court of Appeals vacated the dismissal, holding that federal law does not prevent a holder of a TN or TD visa from establishing an Arizona domicile if they have begun seeking an immigrant visa or adjustment of status that could lead to permanent residency. Congress contemplated that these visa holders might be able to establish a United States domicile by following these processes. Allowing an Arizona court to exercise jurisdiction in this dissolution proceeding would not alter Maria's immigration status or limit remedies under federal immigration law. The case was remanded to the trial court to determine whether Maria satisfies the domicile requirement under Arizona law by weighing relevant factors, including her immigration status and intent.",,,,,,,
"A Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status applicant, whose I-360 petition was revoked by USCIS because it was received on his 21st birthday instead of before, challenges the revocation. He alleges (1) that USCIS's regulations for filing, which do not permit same-day electronic or hand delivery for I-360 petitions, are unreasonable under the APA, (2) that the agency's 16-month delay between approving and then revoking his petition was unreasonable under the APA, and (3) that the inability to file electronically, unlike other applicants, violates his constitutional rights under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. To what extent does a U.S. District Court have subject matter jurisdiction to review these claims?","A U.S. District Court has jurisdiction to review the plaintiff’s Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claim challenging the reasonableness of USCIS’s regulations on filing petitions seeking special immigrant juvenile status and the implementation of those regulations, because the statutory delegation of authority to promulgate such regulations is not found within the INA subchapter that contains jurisdiction-stripping provisions. However, the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to review the plaintiff’s APA claim that the agency unreasonably delayed in revoking the petition, as 8 U.S.C. § 1155 grants the Secretary unlimited discretion regarding the timing of revocation decisions (""at any time""). The court also lacks jurisdiction to consider the plaintiff’s constitutional claims (Equal Protection and Due Process), as jurisdiction for such claims rests exclusively with the circuit courts of appeal under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D).",,,,,,,

"An individual in removal proceedings, who has a U.S. citizen spouse with chronic health conditions like high cholesterol and asthma, files a motion to reopen her case to apply for cancellation of removal, asserting that her removal would cause ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" to her spouse. She also argues that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) applied an incorrect legal standard in evaluating her prima facie eligibility for relief. How should a U.S. Court of Appeals rule on the petition for review?","The U.S. Court of Appeals should deny the petition for review. The court would find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion by determining that the individual failed to establish prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal, as the spouse's conditions (high cholesterol and asthma) and associated emotional hardship were not shown to be ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" beyond what is normally expected from the deportation of an alien with close family members. Furthermore, the court would conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion by applying an incorrect legal standard, as the record indicates the BIA and the Immigration Judge (IJ) used the ""reasonable likelihood"" standard, citing relevant precedent, despite not explicitly expounding upon it. The individual's claim regarding the rescission of her in absentia removal order would be considered forfeited.",,,,,,,
"Under what circumstances may a U.S. District Court deny a prevailing party's motion for attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) due to insufficient proof of financial eligibility, even when an affidavit from the party attests to meeting the statutory net worth requirement?","A U.S. District Court may deny in part, without prejudice, a motion for attorney's fees under the EAJA when a prevailing party's affidavit asserting compliance with the $2,000,000 net worth requirement is insufficient, particularly when challenged by defendants citing record evidence that suggests a potentially higher net worth. While an affidavit can be an efficient way to present evidence of net worth, the court must assess the entire record to determine if the financial eligibility burden of proof is met. If the record contains significant information about the party's finances—such as ownership stakes in corporations with substantial assets, past income, or declared net worth figures—that raises concerns about the accuracy of a bare affidavit, the party must provide additional documentation regarding their assets and liabilities to reconcile the affidavit with the balance of the record. Failure to do so, by not providing documentation that aligns with or explains away conflicting record evidence, constitutes a failure to meet the burden of proof, leading the court to deny the motion without prejudice and potentially order supplemental briefing.",,,,,,,
"An employer seeks an H-1B visa for a ""Vice President of Strategic Planning"" role, requiring a bachelor's degree in Business Administration or a closely related field. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) denied the petition, stating that a generalized business administration degree does not meet the ""specific specialty"" requirement for a ""specialty occupation."" The employer challenges this denial, arguing that USCIS misinterpreted the regulatory standard and abused its discretion. Should the court uphold USCIS's denial?","Yes, the court should uphold USCIS's denial. USCIS did not err in interpreting the specialty occupation criteria to require a degree in a ""specific specialty that is directly related to the proffered position,"" reading the regulation in conjunction with the Immigration and Nationality Act. A generalized bachelor's degree in business administration, which covers a diverse and general range of operations and academic programs, is not considered a ""specific specialty"" to qualify a position as a specialty occupation. Vision Builders failed to show that the position normally requires a specialized degree, that such a requirement is common in the industry among similar organizations (providing no evidence of similarity), or that the position is so complex or unique that it *only* requires an individual with a specialized degree, as its duties were deemed generic. Furthermore, as this was a new position for Vision Builders, it could not demonstrate what it ""normally requires"" for the role.",,,,,,,
"An asylum seeker, Mr. X, claims he fears torture if returned to his home country. He alleges that he was severely beaten and robbed by two uniformed police officers who forcibly entered his home, accusing him of a crime they knew he did not commit, and explicitly stated they were doing so because Mr. X had previously reported a corrupt local official. Mr. X states these officers were known for taking bribes and acting on personal vendettas, and that the government often claims such officers are ""rogue agents"" not acting officially. Will Mr. X's claim likely satisfy the ""official capacity"" requirement for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) regulations, based on the actions of these officers?","Yes, Mr. X's claim regarding the actions of the uniformed police officers will likely satisfy the ""official capacity"" requirement for protection under the CAT regulations. Under Department of Justice regulations implementing the CAT, an act constitutes ""torture"" only if it is inflicted or approved by a public official or other person ""acting in an official capacity,"" which means acting ""under color of law."" The ""under color of law"" standard is the *only* standard to apply; the concept of a distinct ""rogue official"" standard is rejected as risking confusion. The standard draws no categorical distinction between the acts of low- and high-level officials. An official acts ""under color of law"" when they exercise power possessed by virtue of law and made possible only because they were clothed with the authority of law. This often involves the misuse of authority, where an official uses their official authority to fulfill personal objectives. Therefore, even if the officers were motivated by personal vendettas or were considered ""corrupt, low-level agents,"" their actions would still be ""under color of law"" if they misused their power as police officers, clothed with the authority of law, to inflict the harm. The relevant question is whether they acted under color of law, not whether they were ""rogue"" in the sense of not serving the interests of the entire government.",,,,,,,
"Can an annulled marriage, previously determined to be for the purpose of evading immigration laws, be used to deny a subsequent I-360 self-petition filed under VAWA, even if the petitioner demonstrates battery or extreme cruelty in the later marriage?","Yes, the annulled marriage can still bar approval of a subsequent I-360 petition. The court affirmed that the plaintiff's I-360 Petition was properly denied under 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c) because he previously sought immediate relative status based on a marriage (to A-G-) determined to have been entered into for the purpose of evading immigration laws. The annulment did not negate his intent at the time of the marriage. Additionally, even if the plaintiff could overcome the 204(c) bar, the petition would still be denied because he failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he entered into his marriage to R-D- in good faith, which is an independent eligibility requirement for the I-360 petition.",,,,,,,
"Can an asylum applicant challenge the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision not to refer their case to a three-member panel, or argue that the BIA was biased for not requiring the government to file a brief, or claim a due process violation because a single BIA member rendered a decision that effectively precludes reversal of an immigration judge's order without an intervening change in law?","No. The court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA's discretionary decision not to refer a case to a three-member panel because there are no meaningful standards to judge the agency's exercise of discretion. Furthermore, the BIA's decision not to require the government to file briefing does not establish bias, as regulations allow both parties to forgo filing briefs. Finally, the court rejected the argument that a single-member BIA panel decision, which cannot reverse an immigration judge's order unless plainly consistent with and required by an intervening change in law, violates due process. This is because referral to a three-member panel is discretionary, meaning no liberty interest is at stake, and agencies have discretion to fashion their own rules of procedure. The court also noted that raw asylum grant statistics do not support a finding of due process denial.",,,,,,,
"A lawful permanent resident seeking naturalization was convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, causing a loss of over $10,000. The sentencing for this offense was less than one year of imprisonment. Can this conviction be deemed an ""aggravated felony"" under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), thus precluding naturalization due to a lack of good moral character, even if the offense might also be classified as a ""theft offense"" under § 1101(a)(43)(G) which requires a minimum one-year imprisonment term?","Yes, the conviction can be deemed an aggravated felony. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has expressly overruled the ""hybrid offense"" theory established in *Nugent v. Ashcroft*. An offense that ""involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000"" is an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) regardless of whether it also meets the requirements of any other subparagraph, such as the one-year imprisonment threshold for ""theft offenses"" under § 1101(a)(43)(G). Each subparagraph of § 1101(a)(43) lays out a separate aggravated felony, and there is no indication in the statute that an offense must satisfy multiple subparagraphs. Therefore, a conviction for conspiracy to commit wire fraud with a stipulated loss exceeding $10,000 qualifies as an aggravated felony under § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), precluding a finding of good moral character for naturalization.",,,,,,,
"A rancher whose property is near the U.S. southern border experienced significant damage, including lost cattle profits, depleted water, and trash, directly linked to a dramatic increase in illegal immigration following the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) decisions to halt border wall construction and terminate the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) without conducting environmental analyses. Does this rancher have legal standing to challenge DHS's actions, and would DHS be found in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)?","Yes, the rancher (Steven Smith) has standing to sue, and DHS would be found in violation of NEPA.
The Court found that Smith suffered concrete and particularized injuries, including lost profits from cattle that ingested trash, depleted water reserves due to migrants tying down float systems in water troughs, and trespass with detritus left behind by migrants. These harms are considered concrete ""monetary injury"" or bear a close relationship to harms traditionally recognized in American courts. His testimony about experiencing these injuries almost daily in the last three years, in contrast to a couple of times a month during the previous administration, was found credible.
Causation was established through an ""enticement theory"" with three links supported by a preponderance of the evidence:
1.  **Relaxed Policies:** DHS's decisions to halt border wall construction and terminate MPP relaxed deterrents and consequences for illegal immigration, reversing a 27-year proven border security strategy and effectively ""unsecuring the border almost overnight,"" according to expert testimony from former senior border officials.
2.  **Responsive Migrants:** Migrants reacted predictably to these relaxed policies, leading to a sharp uptick in illegal immigration, which overwhelmed Border Patrol resources nationwide and diverted manpower away from areas like the Tucson Sector, where Smith lives, thus increasing unpatrolled areas.
3.  **Related Harms:** This dramatic increase in illegal immigration directly led to the increased migrant traffic on Smith’s land, causing the damage to his property, water, and cattle.
The Court concluded that both the cessation of border wall construction and the rescission of MPP constituted ""major Federal actions"" under NEPA, requiring environmental analysis. DHS concededly failed to perform this analysis, thus acting ""without observance of procedure required by law"" in violation of NEPA.",,,,,,,
"An individual applies for an EB-5 visa, having invested capital in a new commercial enterprise. Their investment agreement includes a ""call option,"" which grants the company the choice to buy out the investor's interest at a specified price after certain conditions are met, but does not give the investor any right to demand repayment. USCIS denies the EB-5 petition, asserting that the call option means the investor's capital is not ""at risk"" and thus constitutes a prohibited debt arrangement. Is USCIS's denial likely to be upheld as consistent with federal law and prior agency decisions?","No, USCIS's denial based solely on the presence of a call option that does not grant the investor a right to demand repayment is unlikely to be upheld. The court found that USCIS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it declared investors ineligible for visas due to call options, concluding that such options do not provide investors with any right to repayment and therefore still place their capital at risk. The court distinguished a call option (a right held by the company) from a sell option (a right held by the investor, which *does* make capital not at risk), finding that USCIS's interpretation stretched the rationale of *Matter of Izummi* and conflicted with the plain language of the regulations. Therefore, the denial, which lacks a rational connection between the facts and the choice made, would likely be set aside.",,,,,,,
"A U-visa applicant, whose application has been pending for over four years, files a lawsuit against USCIS alleging unreasonable delay in determining their eligibility for the U-visa waitlist and failure to issue interim employment authorization documents (EAD). The applicant cites a 2011 regulation mandating EAD adjudication within 90 days or the issuance of interim documents. The government moves to dismiss all claims, arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction under IIRIRA provisions (8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(g), 1252(a)(5), and 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)) and failure to state a claim, further contending that the 2011 EAD regulation was repealed in 2017 and therefore does not apply. How should the court rule on these claims?","The court should rule as follows:
1.  **Jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(g) and 1252(a)(5):** The court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint. These IIRIRA provisions do not apply because the plaintiff is not challenging the commencement, adjudication, or execution of a removal order, nor seeking review of a removal order. Instead, the claims challenge the government's delay in adjudicating U-visa waitlist eligibility and work authorization.
2.  **Unreasonable Delay in U-Visa Waitlist Eligibility (APA & Mandamus):**
    *   **Jurisdiction:** The court has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). Determining eligibility for the U-visa waitlist is a mandatory assessment, not a discretionary decision specified by statute, as 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(2) requires eligible petitioners to be placed on the waitlist.
    *   **Merits (Failure to State a Claim):** The plaintiff fails to state a claim for unreasonable delay. While the four-year delay is substantial and several ""TRAC test"" factors favor the plaintiff (e.g., sense of Congress for 180-day processing, human welfare interests, prejudice by delay), the D.C. Circuit precedent places significant weight on the ""competing priorities"" factor. A judicial order expediting this single application would merely shift the plaintiff ahead of thousands of other equally worthy applicants, creating more unfairness than it would remedy, and would interfere with the agency's resource allocation, which is a matter for the political branches.
3.  **Failure to Adjudicate EAD under 8 U.S.C. § 1184(p)(6) (APA & Mandamus):** The court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this claim. The statute explicitly states that ""The Secretary may grant work authorization,"" indicating a purely discretionary decision. Therefore, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) strips the court of jurisdiction to review the Secretary's handling of such discretionary EAD requests, and there is no clear duty to act required for APA or mandamus relief.
4.  **Failure to Issue Interim Work Authorization under 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) (2011) (APA & Mandamus):**
    *   **Applicable Regulation:** The 2011 version of 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) applies. It was in effect when the plaintiff filed their application in June 2016 and when the 90-day adjudication period expired in September 2016. Applying the later-effective 2017 repeal retroactively would strip the plaintiff of a vested right to interim work authorization, which is impermissible without express congressional authorization.
    *   **Jurisdiction:** The court has jurisdiction. The 2011 regulation's language (""USCIS will adjudicate... within 90 days... Failure to complete the adjudication within 90 days will result in the grant..."") creates a clear, mandatory duty for the agency to either adjudicate or issue interim EAD, making it a discrete agency action required to be taken under the APA. Judicial review is not precluded by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as that section applies only to statutory, not regulatory, discretion.
    *   **Merits (Stated a Claim):** The plaintiff has stated a claim for agency action unlawfully withheld. The plain language of the 2011 regulation requires adjudication or issuance of interim EAD within 90 days of receipt, which the agency failed to do. The agency's interpretation that the 90-day clock begins only after a threshold determination on an underlying benefit has no support in the regulation's text and is contradicted by the agency's own reasons for repealing the rule.
5.  **Challenge to Repeal of 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) (2011) without Notice-and-Comment:** This claim is dismissed. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendants' arguments in opposition, thereby conceding the issue. Furthermore, the complaint lacked factual allegations supporting the claim, and the Federal Register documentation shows that the agency followed proper notice-and-comment procedures for the repeal.",,,,,,,
"A group of nonimmigrant visa applicants filed a lawsuit against U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging unreasonable delays in the adjudication of their applications for extension of status and/or work authorization due to a new biometrics policy. Some plaintiffs' applications are adjudicated during the pendency of the lawsuit, while others remain pending at a USCIS service center located in the Northern District of Texas. What procedural actions will the D.C. District Court likely take regarding the claims of the plaintiffs?","The D.C. District Court will dismiss as moot the claims of those plaintiffs whose applications have been adjudicated since the suit was filed, due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction. For the remaining plaintiffs whose applications are still awaiting adjudication, the court will transfer their claims to the Northern District of Texas, where the relevant USCIS service center is located. This transfer is deemed appropriate because the transferee district is where the decision-making process for their applications occurs, and factors such as convenience of parties and witnesses, the interest of justice, and the location of evidence weigh in favor of transfer.",,,,,,,
"An immigration advocacy group, similar to the American Immigration Council, seeks records from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding a program where CBP agents conducted credible fear interviews. The group specifically requested records related to training materials, supervision protocols, and grant/denial rates, but CBP only searched for a limited set of categories. USCIS and DHS withheld several documents, including drafts, issue papers, briefing memos, and an email containing names of CBP officers, citing deliberative process and personal privacy exemptions. The group challenges the adequacy of CBP's search and the agencies' withholdings. How would a federal court likely rule on these challenges based on the provided case precedent?","Based on the provided case precedent, a federal court would likely rule as follows:
1.  **CBP's Search:** The court would find CBP's search insufficient. CBP only searched for two out of seven requested categories, relying on the assertion that DHS and USCIS were the ""likely custodians"" for the others. The court found this justification inadequate, as CBP's role was not sufficiently limited to excuse it from searching other relevant categories, nor was the search description for the categories it *did* search adequately detailed. CBP would be ordered to conduct a more comprehensive search.
2.  **Exemption 5 (Deliberative Process) Withholdings by DHS and USCIS:** The court would likely find that DHS and USCIS did not adequately justify these withholdings. The agencies' descriptions of the documents (drafts, issue papers, briefing memos, meeting topics) and their role in a deliberative process were deemed too broad and conclusory, lacking specific detail on the decision or policy involved, the nature of the deliberation, or the specific foreseeable harm disclosure would cause. The agencies would be given an opportunity to supplement their Vaughn indices with more detailed justifications or release the documents, and in camera inspection would likely be ordered given the small number of documents.
3.  **Exemptions 6 and 7(C) (Personal Privacy) Withholdings by USCIS for CBP Officer Names:** The court would find these withholdings improper. While the document (an email concerning job duties) was considered a ""similar file"" under Exemption 6, the privacy interest in the CBP officers' names was deemed de minimis, especially compared to unredacted USCIS asylum officers' names in the same document. Even if a substantial privacy interest existed, the public interest in understanding government operations, particularly given that CBP officers were instructed not to disclose their identity during interviews, would significantly outweigh it. The court would order the unredacted document to be produced.",,,,,,,
"An alien petitions for review of a BIA decision denying cancellation of removal and voluntary departure, challenging the BIA's finding that he lacked good moral character, as well as asserting that the BIA's decision was ultra vires because temporary BIA members' terms had expired.

However, the court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA's factual finding that an alien lacks ""good moral character"" for cancellation of removal and voluntary departure purposes, as this is an ""authoritative decision"" regarding the granting or denying of discretionary relief under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B). The court will also dismiss arguments disguised as legal questions that essentially ask to reweigh facts, or arguments that are inadequately briefed, or unexhausted arguments where the government properly raises the exhaustion defense.",,,,,,,
"A plaintiff filed a lawsuit in the District of Columbia challenging the denial of an immigrant visa petition by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The petition was processed and denied at a USCIS service center located in the Northern District of Texas, and the plaintiff resides in Maryland. The government has moved to transfer the case to either the Northern District of Texas or the District of Maryland. In which district would venue be proper for this action, and should the case be transferred there?","Venue would be proper in the Northern District of Texas, and the case should be transferred there.
An action against the federal government can be brought in any judicial district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Here, the plaintiff's Form I-140 petition was processed and denied at USCIS’s Texas Service Center, located in the Northern District of Texas, meaning a substantial part of the events occurred there. The plaintiff's argument that the events in Texas were merely a byproduct of D.C. policy decisions is rejected because the claim focuses on the application of eligibility criteria to a specific petition in Texas, not a challenge to national policy from D.C.

The case should be transferred to the Northern District of Texas based on both public and private interests.
*   **Public Interests:** The controversy is local to the Northern District of Texas, where the petition was processed and denied. Courts routinely find that cases challenging immigration petition denials should be decided where the petition was processed. The familiarity of courts with federal law is neutral, and while the Northern District of Texas is marginally more congested than the D.C. court, it does not have such enormous backlogs to prevent transfer, especially given the strong local interest.
*   **Private Interests:** The government prefers the Northern District of Texas. The claim arose in that district. Convenience to the parties, witnesses, and evidence also favors the Northern District of Texas, as any relevant witnesses or documents are most likely located there. The plaintiff's choice to litigate in D.C. receives only minimal deference because the plaintiff does not reside in D.C. and the factual allegations lack a significant nexus to D.C. officials or their specific actions.

Therefore, considering all factors, the case should be transferred to the Northern District of Texas. The transferring court found it appropriate to transfer the case without fully resolving its own subject matter jurisdiction, leaving that question for the transferee court to determine.",,,,,,,
"Under U.S. immigration law, can a foreign-born child claim citizenship through a parent who never actually resided in the U.S., by arguing that the parent constructively satisfied statutory physical presence requirements for citizenship transmission, particularly when a foreign government's actions, rather than a U.S. government error, prevented actual physical presence?","No, the court affirmed that the constructive physical presence doctrine does not apply to transmit United States citizenship under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 in such circumstances. The Act's plain language provides only limited exceptions to physical presence requirements (for military service or government employment), and courts decline to read broader equitable exceptions into the statute. The precedent allowing constructive physical presence for transmission (*Matter of Navarrete*) is specifically limited to scenarios where a U.S. government error prevented compliance with the physical presence requirements. Since no U.S. government error caused the father's inability to reside in the U.S., the doctrine does not apply. Consequently, the related equal protection claim also fails because there was no differential treatment compared to a similarly situated individual (i.e., one affected by U.S. government error).",,,,,,,
"An individual, who is a lawful permanent resident, was convicted in a New York State court of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law § 265.03(1)(b). Is this conviction considered a ""crime of violence"" under 18 U.S.C. § 16, making the individual removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony and ineligible for cancellation of removal?","Yes, a conviction for criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree in violation of N.Y. Penal Law § 265.03(1)(b) constitutes a ""crime of violence"" under 18 U.S.C. § 16, because it involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense. This consequently qualifies it as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F) and 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), triggering removability and ineligibility for cancellation of removal.",,,,,,,
"A beneficiary of an I-140 petition requests to port to a new employer under 8 U.S.C. § 1154(j) while the I-140 petition is still pending. USCIS subsequently issues a Request for Evidence (RFE) for the I-140 petition but sends it only to the original petitioning employer. The original employer fails to respond, and USCIS denies the petition. The beneficiary attempts to appeal the denial but is told they are not a recognized party. Did USCIS act improperly in this scenario?","Yes, USCIS acted improperly. The court ruled that when an I-140 petition is pending before USCIS and the agency receives notice that the beneficiary has requested to port to a new employer, USCIS acts inconsistently with the portability provision (8 U.S.C. § 1154(j)) if it continues to treat only the original employer as a party to the petition adjudication proceeding. Regulations preventing I-140 beneficiaries from being recognized as parties to petition proceedings and from appealing denials are deemed a ""mere nullity"" in this context because they conflict with the statutory scheme created by the portability provision. USCIS should have treated the I-140 beneficiary as a party, sent the Request for Evidence to the beneficiary, and permitted the beneficiary to appeal the denial. Consequently, the court vacated the denial of the I-140 petition and remanded the case for USCIS to provide the beneficiary an opportunity to respond to the request for evidence.",,,,,,,
"An alien from El Salvador seeks asylum and withholding of removal in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security presents an Interpol Red Notice indicating an active warrant for the alien's arrest in El Salvador for violating Article 345 of the Salvadoran Penal Code, which proscribes participation in an illicit organization whose purpose is the commission of crimes. The Red Notice also suggests the alien is a ""hit man"" for a gang. Can the Interpol Red Notice constitute sufficient evidence to trigger the serious nonpolitical crime bar, and how would the court assess the ""seriousness"" of such a crime for purposes of asylum and withholding eligibility?","Yes, an Interpol Red Notice may constitute reliable evidence indicating that the serious nonpolitical crime bar for asylum and withholding of removal applies to an alien. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can meet its burden to shift the burden of proof to the alien by presenting ""some evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that one or more grounds for mandatory denial of the application for relief may apply,"" which an Interpol Red Notice, corroborated by other evidence like a Form I-213, can satisfy. An Interpol Red Notice is considered reliable for what it purports to be: a request by a member country for provisional arrest based on a valid national arrest warrant for a serious ordinary law crime.

Once the burden shifts, the alien must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the serious nonpolitical crime bar does not apply. Regarding the ""seriousness"" of the crime, a violation of Article 345 of the Salvadoran Penal Code, which criminalizes participation in an illicit organization whose purpose is the commission of crimes and uses violent means, is considered ""serious."" This assessment takes into account whether the conduct involved a substantial risk of violence and harm to persons and the maximum term of imprisonment (e.g., up to 9 years for Article 345). The Board does not need to explicitly consider the atrociousness of the acts in every case to determine that a crime is serious.",,,,,,,
"An asylum seeker submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for all documents related to their asylum application, which was granted in 2013. The government, however, is withholding some documents from 2010-2012 under FOIA Exemption 5, claiming they are predecisional and deliberative. The asylum seeker believes the final decision to grant asylum was actually made in 2010, not 2013, and thus these documents should be disclosed as post-decisional. Based on similar circumstances, what is the likely outcome regarding the disclosure of these documents?","The court is likely to find that the documents are predecisional and generally protected under FOIA Exemption 5 by the deliberative-process privilege, as the final asylum decision was not made until all official agency processes, including vetting and Headquarters approval, were complete in 2013. However, the court will likely order the government to re-assess the documents and release any reasonably segregable, non-exempt factual material that does not expose the deliberative process.",,,,,,,
"Imagine a noncitizen, Ms. A, was convicted under a state law that criminalizes accessory-after-the-fact with a ""general intent"" requirement. Federal immigration authorities classify this conviction as an ""aggravated felony"" related to obstruction of justice, which generically requires ""specific intent,"" and initiate expedited removal proceedings. Ms. A argues the state law is not a categorical match and that the expedited removal process violated her due process rights due to procedural errors. What is the likely outcome regarding her aggravated felony classification and the validity of her removal order, based on a federal court's review?","Based on the ruling, the noncitizen's state conviction for accessory-after-the-fact, which requires only general intent under state law, would *not* be considered a categorical match for the generic federal offense of obstruction of justice, which requires specific intent, and thus would not be an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(S). Consequently, the noncitizen was improperly designated as an aggravated felon. Furthermore, the expedited removal order would be found to violate the noncitizen's due process rights due to DHS's failure to follow regulatory procedures, such as issuing a Final Administrative Removal Order (FARO) before or on the same day as the Notice of Intent (NOI) and not providing the required response period, which prejudiced the noncitizen by preventing a challenge to the aggravated felony designation. The court would grant the petition for review, vacate the removal order, and remand the case, directing the government to facilitate the noncitizen's return for further proceedings.",,,,,,,
"When a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) order is subject to a petition for judicial review, but the BIA subsequently grants a motion to reconsider, expressly vacates the initial order, and issues a new order with materially different reasoning, does the federal appellate court retain jurisdiction over the initial vacated order?","No, a federal appellate court does not retain jurisdiction over an initial Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) order if the BIA subsequently grants a motion to reconsider, expressly vacates that initial order, and issues a new final order of removal that materially alters the reasoning and substance of the prior order. Such a petition for review is moot because the court cannot provide effective relief from an order that has been vacated and replaced by an order relying on materially different reasoning.",,,,,,,
"An individual, a lawful permanent resident, is convicted under Texas Penal Code § 22.04(a) for ""injury to a child by omission"" after a plea agreement indicated the victim was a child younger than 14. The Department of Homeland Security initiates removal proceedings, asserting the conviction is a ""crime of child abuse"" under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i). The individual argues that the Texas statute is indivisible and thus not a categorical match to the federal definition, and even if divisible, the state's definition of ""bodily injury"" is overbroad compared to the federal definition of child abuse. How would a federal court of appeals likely rule on these arguments based on precedent?","A federal court of appeals would likely rule that the Texas Penal Code § 22.04(a) is divisible as to victim class. This means the court can apply the modified categorical approach, consulting documents like the plea agreement to confirm that the conviction was for injuring a child. The court would likely reject the argument that the statute is overbroad, finding that ""bodily injury"" under Texas law, which includes ""any physical pain, however minor,"" is not demonstrably broader than the BIA's definition of child abuse, which encompasses ""the infliction on a child of physical harm, even if slight."" Furthermore, the court would likely find that the petitioner failed to provide specific examples of Texas courts applying § 22.04(a) to conduct that falls outside the generic federal definition of child abuse. Therefore, the individual would likely be found removable.",,,,,,,
"An immigration applicant, having established past persecution, challenges the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)'s decision to deny withholding of removal. The BIA, without remanding to the Immigration Judge (IJ), found that the presumption of future persecution was rebutted by relying on facts not found by the IJ and by failing to explicitly address the applicant's alternative ""pattern-or-practice"" claim. The applicant also challenges the BIA's denial of her Convention Against Torture (CAT) claim, which the BIA affirmed by incorporating the IJ's reasoning. Did the BIA err in its handling of the withholding of removal and CAT claims?","Yes, the BIA erred in its handling of the withholding of removal claim because it violated its own regulations by impermissibly finding facts not previously determined by the Immigration Judge and by failing to address the applicant's pattern-or-practice claim for relief. Therefore, the petition for review is granted in part regarding withholding of removal, and the case is remanded for further proceedings. However, the BIA did not err in denying the Convention Against Torture (CAT) claim, as its explanation, which incorporated the IJ's reasoning, was adequate. The petition for review is denied in part with respect to the CAT claim.",,,,,,,
"An individual in removal proceedings, a native and citizen of Cameroon, seeks review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision. The BIA affirmed an immigration judge's (IJ) denial of a motion to continue removal proceedings to await adjudication of a relative's I-130 petition. Additionally, the BIA denied a motion to remand the case to the IJ after the I-130 petition was approved, so the individual could pursue adjustment of status. The IJ had previously denied the continuance motion for failure to show good cause, citing untimeliness and lack of diligence in pursuing the I-130 petition. Does the Court of Appeals have jurisdiction to review the BIA's affirmance of the continuance denial, and did the BIA abuse its discretion in denying the motion to remand?","The Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction to review the BIA's continuance determination because the ""good cause"" standard for a continuance, unlike an ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" standard, has discretion baked into it and does not involve a reviewable application of a legal standard under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D). Therefore, the petition for review regarding the continuance denial is dismissed. Regarding the motion to remand, the BIA did not abuse its discretion. It was ""perceptibl[y rational"" for the BIA to determine that the individual failed to show due diligence in pursuing adjustment of status through his daughter, as she filed her I-130 petition nearly a year after becoming eligible to do so, and counsel helped ""quickly put together"" the petition only after marital difficulties arose. Therefore, the petition for review regarding the denial of the motion to remand is denied.",,,,,,,
"An alien was apprehended after illegal entry and provided an address to immigration officials. The address was deficient, leading to returned mail and the alien's in absentia removal. Eighteen years later, the alien moves to reopen removal proceedings, asserting that a different, correct address was initially provided and that the immigration officer made an error, thus entitling the alien to notice. The alien further argues that the original Notice to Appear (NTA) was defective for failing to specify the date and time of the hearing, making them eligible for cancellation of removal, particularly in light of subsequent Supreme Court precedent that clarified the ""stop-time rule."" How should a court rule on the alien's motion to reopen and claim of eligibility for cancellation of removal?","The court would deny the petition for review. Regarding the motion to reopen removal proceedings and rescind the in absentia removal order, the immigration judge (IJ) rejected the alien's affidavit testimony as untrustworthy and found that the alien provided a deficient address. Substantial evidence supports this factual finding, meaning the alien failed to provide an address at which they could be contacted, thus forfeiting their right to notice. An alien who forfeits their right to notice by failing to provide a viable mailing address cannot seek to reopen the removal proceedings and rescind the in absentia removal order for lack of notice. Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in affirming the IJ's decision. Regarding the alien's claim of eligibility for cancellation of removal, the alien failed to analyze this theory in a meaningful way in their opening brief, and thus the argument is forfeited. It is of no consequence that then-valid circuit precedent foreclosed the cancellation argument at the time the opening brief was submitted, as the argument was nonetheless available to the alien.",,,,,,,
