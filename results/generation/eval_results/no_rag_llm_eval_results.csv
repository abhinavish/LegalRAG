"An individual in removal proceedings had their application for asylum and other relief denied due to failure to submit biometrics, despite being previously instructed by the Immigration Judge while pro se. They subsequently retained counsel, who also failed to advise them about the biometrics requirement. After the denial, and more than 90 days after the final order of removal, they filed a motion to reopen, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel prevented a merits hearing and that this justified equitable tolling of the filing deadline. They also requested *sua sponte* reopening by the Board of Immigration Appeals.

Additionally, the court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA's discretionary decision not to invoke its *sua sponte* authority to reopen a case.","Based on immigration law and precedent, it is **highly unlikely** that this individual would successfully overturn the denial of their motion to reopen based on equitable tolling due to counsel's ineffectiveness, or compel the BIA to *sua sponte* reopen their case.

Here's a breakdown of the legal principles:

1.  **Motion to Reopen (MTR) Deadlines and Equitable Tolling:**
    *   **General Rule:** A motion to reopen must generally be filed within **90 days** of the date of the final administrative order of removal (8 CFR § 1003.2(c)(2)).
    *   **Equitable Tolling Standard:** Equitable tolling is an extraordinary remedy that allows for the extension of a filing deadline. To succeed, a litigant must typically show:
        1.  **Diligence:** They have been pursuing their rights diligently.
        2.  **Extraordinary Circumstances:** Some extraordinary circumstance prevented them from filing on time.
    *   **Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (IAC) and Tolling:** While IAC can be a ground for a motion to reopen, it generally **does not** equitably toll the 90-day deadline for filing the motion to reopen itself.
        *   Courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) have consistently held that the ineffectiveness of counsel in the *underlying proceedings* (e.g., failing to advise on biometrics, leading to the denial) is distinct from counsel's actions preventing the *timely filing of a motion to reopen*.
        *   For IAC to toll the MTR deadline, the ineffectiveness would typically need to be directly related to the *failure to file the MTR on time* (e.g., counsel actively misled the client about the MTR deadline, or absconded with the file preventing timely filing).
        *   In this case, the IAC related to the biometrics requirement, which led to the *initial denial* of relief. It is not presented as counsel actively preventing the client from filing the MTR within 90 days of the final order. The client was aware of the final order.
    *   **Impact of Prior Knowledge:** The fact that the individual was *previously instructed by the Immigration Judge while pro se* about the biometrics requirement significantly weakens any argument for equitable tolling. It suggests a lack of diligence on the part of the applicant, even if counsel was subsequently ineffective. The applicant had prior notice of a fundamental requirement. This makes it harder to argue that ""extraordinary circumstances"" entirely prevented them from understanding or pursuing their rights diligently regarding the biometrics or the subsequent MTR.

2.  ***Sua Sponte* Reopening by the BIA:**
    *   **Discretionary Nature:** The BIA has the discretionary authority to reopen or reconsider a case *sua sponte* (on its own motion) at any time (8 CFR § 1003.2(a)). This power is reserved for truly exceptional situations.
    *   **Non-Reviewability:** Crucially, the BIA's decision *not* to exercise its *sua sponte* authority is generally **not reviewable** by federal courts. This means an individual cannot ""compel"" the BIA to reopen a case *sua sponte*. It is entirely within the BIA's discretion, and a denial of such a request cannot be appealed to a higher court.
    *   **Application:** While IAC *could* be a factor the BIA considers in deciding whether to exercise its *sua sponte* authority, it is not a guarantee, especially given the applicant's prior knowledge of the biometrics requirement. The BIA is unlikely to view this as an ""exceptional situation"" warranting *sua sponte* action, particularly when the applicant had multiple opportunities (pro se with IJ instruction, then with counsel) to address the biometrics issue.

**Conclusion:**

The individual faces significant hurdles:

*   **Equitable Tolling:** The argument for equitable tolling of the 90-day MTR deadline due to IAC is weak because the IAC pertained to the *underlying merits* (biometrics), not to the ability to file the MTR itself on time. Furthermore, the applicant's prior knowledge of the biometrics requirement from the IJ undermines the ""diligence"" and ""extraordinary circumstances"" elements required for equitable tolling.
*   ***Sua Sponte* Reopening:** While requested, the BIA's decision on *sua sponte* reopening is purely discretionary and cannot be compelled or reviewed by federal courts.

Therefore, it is **unlikely** the individual would succeed in overturning the denial of their motion to reopen or compelling *sua sponte* reopening.",[],,0.8362166285514832,14.469402439024389,30.271126016260183
"An organization, ""Global Solutions Institute,"" seeks an H-1B visa cap exemption as a ""nonprofit research organization."" USCIS denies the petition, interpreting ""primarily engaged in basic research and/or applied research"" to mean ""directly and principally engaged in research,"" and finds Global Solutions Institute's evidence insufficient to meet this standard.

The court would likely defer to the agency's factual assessment, finding that USCIS's conclusion that the organization failed to meet its evidentiary burden was fair and reasonable, considering the evidence in proportion to its other activities. Finally, regarding prior approvals, the court would likely find that an agency is permitted to change its position, and USCIS adequately explained its decision by acknowledging prior approvals and providing a detailed, reasoned analysis of the current petition based on the record, which is sufficient under the Administrative Procedure Act.",,,,,,,,"A U.S. federal court would likely rule in favor of USCIS, upholding the denial of the H-1B visa cap exemption.

1.  **Misinterpretation of Regulation (Chevron Deference):**
    *   **Likely Ruling:** The court would likely **defer to USCIS's interpretation** of ""primarily engaged in basic research and/or applied research"" to mean ""directly and principally engaged in research.""
    *   **Reasoning:** Under the *Chevron* deference framework, courts typically defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute or regulation it is charged with administering.
        *   **Step 1 (Ambiguity):** The term ""primarily engaged"" can be considered ambiguous. While it generally means ""for the most part"" or ""chiefly,"" its precise application in the context of a specific H-1B cap exemption for research organizations might require agency expertise.
        *   **Step 2 (Reasonableness):** USCIS's interpretation of ""primarily"" as ""directly and principally"" is a reasonable construction, especially for an exemption from a general rule (the H-1B cap). Agencies often interpret exemptions narrowly to ensure only those truly meeting the specific criteria benefit. This interpretation aims to distinguish organizations whose core mission is research from those that merely support research or conduct it as a secondary function. GSI would have a difficult time proving this interpretation is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the regulation.

2.  **Decision Lacked Factual Support (Arbitrary and Capricious Standard):**
    *   **Likely Ruling:** The court would likely **uphold USCIS's finding** that GSI's evidence was insufficient, unless GSI can demonstrate a complete lack of rational basis for that finding.
    *   **Reasoning:** Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), agency decisions are reviewed under the ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard. This is a highly deferential standard. The court does not substitute its judgment for that of the agency but rather examines whether the agency considered the relevant factors and articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.
        *   The case states USCIS ""finds Global Solutions Institute's evidence insufficient."" Without knowing the specifics of GSI's evidence or USCIS's detailed reasoning for finding it insufficient, it's difficult for a court to overturn this factual determination. GSI would need to show that USCIS's assessment was patently unreasonable, ignored substantial evidence, or was based on an error of law. Merely disagreeing with the agency's conclusion on the sufficiency of evidence is generally not enough to win under this standard.

3.  **Failed to Explain Departure from Prior Approvals (Arbitrary and Capricious Standard):**
    *   **Likely Ruling:** This is GSI's strongest argument. If GSI can demonstrate that USCIS indeed approved *materially similar* petitions in the past and failed to provide a reasoned explanation for treating GSI's petition differently, the court would likely **find USCIS's decision arbitrary and capricious on this ground and remand the case.**
    *   **Reasoning:** An agency has a duty to treat like cases alike or to provide a reasoned explanation for its departure from precedent. Inconsistent application of regulations without explanation is a hallmark of arbitrary and capricious agency action.
        *   If GSI can present evidence of prior approvals for organizations with demonstrably similar structures, missions, and evidence of research engagement, and USCIS's denial letter for GSI's petition does not address or distinguish those prior approvals, then USCIS would have failed its duty to provide a reasoned explanation.
        *   **Remedy:** A finding on this point would typically result in a *remand* to USCIS, meaning the court would send the case back to the agency. USCIS would then be required to either approve GSI's petition, provide a satisfactory explanation for the different treatment compared to prior approvals, or reconsider its decision in light of the court's ruling. The court would *not* typically grant the visa directly.

**Overall Conclusion:**

A U.S. federal court would likely **uphold USCIS's interpretation of the regulation and its finding regarding the insufficiency of GSI's evidence**, given the high degree of deference afforded to agency expertise and factual determinations. However, GSI has a strong potential argument regarding USCIS's **failure to explain its departure from prior approvals of similar petitions.** If GSI can substantiate this claim, the court would likely **remand the case to USCIS** for reconsideration and a proper explanation, rather than outright reversing the denial.",[],,0.8358555436134338,15.843272215855823,22.132673716012107
"A group of international students had their F-1 visas terminated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after discovering they were ""enrolled"" in a sham university created by DHS as part of a sting operation. The termination letter stated their SEVIS record and Form I-20 had been set to ""Terminated due to your fraudulent enrollment."" The students filed a federal lawsuit challenging the termination, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and Due Process, and seeking an order prohibiting the Government from finding they committed fraud. The District Court dismissed the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding the DHS action was not final because reinstatement proceedings were pending and the case was not ripe for review. The students appealed. If these students were to proceed with their appeal, would the appellate court likely find that the DHS's termination of their F-1 visas constitutes a final agency action ripe for judicial review under the APA?","Yes, the appellate court would likely find that DHS's termination of the F-1 visas constitutes a final agency action ripe for judicial review under the APA. The termination order marked the consummation of the agency's decision-making process by stripping the students of their lawful status and placing a fraud notation on their records, thus determining a ""right or obligation.""

The court would disagree with the District Court's conclusions regarding finality and ripeness for two main reasons:
1.  **Finality of Agency Action:**
    *   **Reinstatement Proceedings Are Not a Prerequisite for Review:** There is no statutory or regulatory requirement for students to seek reinstatement after F-1 visa termination. Moreover, reinstatement proceedings do not provide a mechanism to review the propriety of the original termination order or the ""fraudulent enrollment"" decision. Even if reinstatement is granted, it does not ""wipe away"" the prior agency decision.
    *   **Removal Proceedings Are Not a Prerequisite for Review:** The finality of an order cannot be conditioned on potential, uninitiated removal proceedings, which may never occur. Furthermore, neither immigration judges nor the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) have the authority to review the USCIS's discretionary denial of a motion to reinstate student status or to overturn the initial termination decision. Therefore, removal proceedings do not offer an opportunity to contest the agency action. The termination is the culmination, not the initiation, of the agency's decision-making process.
2.  **Ripeness for Review:**
    *   The case is ripe because the parties are in a sufficiently adversarial posture, and the students are genuinely aggrieved by the termination of their lawful status and the permanent ""fraud"" notation on their records. The government's shifting position on whether the students were victims or participants in the fraud further underscores the need for judicial review that would otherwise be absent.

Here's why:

1.  **Final Agency Action:**
    *   **Consummation of the Agency's Decision-Making Process:** The DHS sent a termination letter and explicitly set the students' SEVIS records and Form I-20s to ""Terminated."" This is not a tentative, preliminary, or interlocutory step. It is a definitive act that marks the end of DHS's decision-making process regarding their F-1 status. The agency has made its final decision to terminate.
    *   **Rights or Obligations Determined, or Legal Consequences Flow:** The termination immediately stripped the students of their legal F-1 status. This has profound legal consequences: they are now out of status, accrue unlawful presence, are subject to removal proceedings, and face significant bars to future immigration benefits due to the ""fraudulent enrollment"" finding. These are concrete, immediate changes to their legal rights and obligations.
    *   **Reinstatement Proceedings:** While reinstatement proceedings might be available, they are a separate, discretionary process to *undo* or *remedy* a completed termination. The availability of a discretionary remedy does not negate the finality of the initial adverse action. The termination itself is a completed act with immediate legal effect.

2.  **Ripeness for Judicial Review:**
    *   **Fitness of the Issues for Judicial Decision:** The students are challenging the legality of the termination under the APA and Due Process, and seeking to prevent a finding of fraud. These are primarily legal questions concerning agency procedure and statutory interpretation, which are well-suited for judicial review without further factual development by the agency.
    *   **Hardship to the Parties of Withholding Court Consideration:** The students face immediate and severe hardship. They are out of status, risk deportation, accrue unlawful presence (which can lead to 3-year or 10-year bars to re-entry), and have a finding of ""fraudulent enrollment"" on their record, which can prejudice all future immigration applications. Waiting for potential reinstatement proceedings (which are discretionary and not guaranteed) would not alleviate this immediate harm and could exacerbate it by allowing more unlawful presence to accrue. The ""fraudulent enrollment"" finding itself is a significant legal consequence that creates immediate hardship.

**Conclusion:**

The District Court's reasoning that the action was not final due to pending reinstatement proceedings and therefore not ripe is likely to be overturned. The termination of the F-1 visas, accompanied by a definitive letter and a change in SEVIS status, is a quintessential final agency action with immediate and severe legal consequences. The legal questions are fit for review, and the hardship to the students is substantial and immediate, making the case ripe for judicial review under the APA.",[],,0.8712776899337769,14.775599869238313,26.19296720061024

Such a challenge would only succeed if the evidence compels a contrary result, meaning your family would suffer hardship above and beyond that regularly faced by families who are separated, which the court found was not established in a similar case.","Yes, you *can* appeal the immigration judge's decision on these grounds, and they represent common and potentially strong arguments in an appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). However, success is never guaranteed and depends heavily on the specific facts of your case and the record created before the immigration judge (IJ).

Let's break down your proposed arguments:

1.  **Arguing the judge applied the wrong legal standard:**
    *   **The Standard:** The phrase ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" is indeed the correct legal standard for non-lawful permanent resident (non-LPR) cancellation of removal under INA 240A(b)(1)(D). So, the judge *cited* the correct standard.
    *   **The Argument:** Your argument wouldn't be that the *phrase itself* is wrong, but rather that the judge *misinterpreted* or *misapplied* that standard to the facts of your case. This is a common and valid ground for appeal. You would argue that the judge's interpretation of ""exceptional and extremely unusual"" was too narrow, failed to consider the cumulative effect of hardships, or set an unreasonably high bar that is inconsistent with BIA and circuit court precedent.

2.  **Arguing the judge failed to adequately consider the dangerous conditions in your home country:**
    *   **Relevance:** This is a very important factor in assessing hardship, especially if your American-citizen child would either:
        *   **Accompany you:** The hardship would be assessed based on the conditions the child would face in your home country (e.g., lack of medical care, poor educational opportunities, violence, poverty, discrimination, lack of family support, cultural shock).
        *   **Remain in the U.S. without you:** While less direct, the conditions in your home country could impact your ability to support your child financially or emotionally from abroad, thus contributing to the child's hardship in the U.S.
    *   **The Argument:** If you presented evidence of dangerous conditions (e.g., country condition reports, expert testimony, personal testimony) and the IJ's decision either ignored this evidence, dismissed it without adequate explanation, or failed to give it proper weight in the overall hardship analysis, this is a strong basis for appeal. You would argue that the IJ's failure to consider or adequately weigh this evidence led to an erroneous conclusion regarding the ""exceptional and extremely unusual"" nature of the hardship.

3.  **Arguing the judge failed to adequately consider the emotional impact on your son:**
    *   **Relevance:** The emotional and psychological impact of a parent's deportation on a qualifying child is a critical component of hardship. This can include:
        *   Separation anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues.
        *   Decline in academic performance.
        *   Loss of parental guidance and support.
        *   Financial hardship if the remaining parent cannot adequately support the child.
        *   Need for therapy or counseling.
        *   The unique bond between parent and child.
    *   **The Argument:** If you presented evidence of your son's emotional impact (e.g., psychological evaluations, school records, testimony from therapists, teachers, or family members, your own testimony about your son's distress) and the IJ's decision failed to address this evidence, minimized its significance, or did not adequately explain why it did not rise to the level of ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship,"" then this is a strong ground for appeal. You would argue that the IJ abused their discretion or made a factual error by not fully appreciating the emotional toll on your son.

**Key Considerations for a Successful Appeal:**

*   **The Record:** Your appeal must be based on the evidence and testimony presented *during your hearing* before the immigration judge. You generally cannot introduce new evidence on appeal (with very limited exceptions).
*   **IJ's Decision:** The BIA will review the IJ's written or oral decision. You need to identify specific errors in the IJ's findings of fact, conclusions of law, or exercise of discretion.
*   **Specificity:** Your appeal brief must clearly articulate *how* the IJ erred, pointing to specific parts of the hearing transcript, exhibits, and legal precedents.
*   **Cumulative Hardship:** Remember that hardship is often assessed cumulatively. Even if one factor alone isn't ""exceptional and extremely unusual,"" the combination of all factors (e.g., dangerous country conditions *plus* severe emotional impact *plus* potential medical needs *plus* financial strain) might meet the standard. You would argue that the IJ failed to consider the totality of the circumstances.
*   **Precedent:** Your attorney will look for BIA and circuit court decisions that have found similar circumstances to constitute ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" to support your arguments.

**In summary:** While the IJ cited the correct legal standard, challenging their *application* of that standard and arguing they failed to adequately consider crucial evidence regarding country conditions and your son's emotional impact are legitimate and frequently used grounds for appeal. It is highly advisable to work with an experienced immigration attorney who can review your entire case record and craft the strongest possible appeal brief.",[],,0.8302174210548401,14.099110768799886,31.1416181207114
"Can a federal district court compel the immediate deportation of an alien who is currently incarcerated for first-degree murder and other serious felonies, despite a prior removal order?","No, a federal district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to compel the immediate deportation of an alien who is currently incarcerated for criminal offenses, such as first-degree murder, because the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) explicitly divests the court of such jurisdiction. The INA states that no court shall have jurisdiction over claims by aliens arising from removal order execution and that the Attorney General may not remove an alien sentenced to imprisonment until released from imprisonment. Furthermore, no claim can be asserted under the INA to compel the release or removal of an alien.

Here's why:

1.  **Separation of Powers and Executive Function:** Immigration enforcement, including the execution of removal orders, is primarily an executive function carried out by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), specifically U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Federal district courts are part of the judicial branch and typically review the legality of executive actions, rather than dictating the timing or execution of those actions.

2.  **Criminal Custody Takes Precedence:** When an alien is incarcerated for a criminal offense, they are in the primary custody of the state or federal correctional system where they are serving their sentence. ICE typically places a ""detainer"" on such individuals, which is a request to be notified before the alien is released from criminal custody and to take custody of the alien upon their release. The alien must generally complete their criminal sentence before they can be transferred to ICE custody for deportation.

3.  **Role of Federal District Courts:** While federal district courts have jurisdiction over certain immigration matters (e.g., challenges to the legality of detention via habeas corpus, or judicial review of certain final agency decisions), they do not have the authority to directly order ICE to immediately deport an individual who is still serving a criminal sentence. Their role is to ensure due process and lawful application of immigration law, not to manage the operational aspects of deportation.

In summary, the existence of a prior removal order means the alien has been legally ordered removed, but the *execution* of that order is contingent on their release from criminal custody. The timing of deportation is an executive decision made by ICE, typically after the alien has served their full criminal sentence. A federal district court would not intervene to compel immediate deportation in such a scenario.",[],,0.8473591804504395,16.150324276950045,20.74723926380372

Furthermore, § 1421(c) provides an ""adequate remedy"" because it allows for broad judicial review, including de novo review, the court making its own findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the full scope of APA review under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), including constitutional claims and challenges to agency action as arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.","No, 8 U.S.C. § 1421(c) generally does **not** preclude federal district court jurisdiction over separate Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and constitutional challenges to a USCIS *policy* underlying naturalization denials.

Here's why:

1.  **Purpose of 8 U.S.C. § 1421(c):** This provision grants federal district courts jurisdiction to conduct a *de novo* review of an *individual naturalization denial*. This means the court reviews the facts and law pertaining to a specific applicant's case, essentially stepping into the shoes of the agency to determine if that individual should be naturalized. The focus is on the application of the law and policy to the specific facts of an applicant's petition.

2.  **Distinction Between Individual Denial and Policy Challenge:**
    *   **Individual Denial Review (under § 1421(c)):** This process is designed to correct errors in the application of existing law or policy to a particular applicant's circumstances.
    *   **Policy Challenge (APA/Constitutional):** These challenges are directed at the *legality* or *constitutionality* of the underlying policy *itself*, regardless of the specific facts of an individual case. For example, an APA challenge might argue that the policy was adopted without proper notice-and-comment rulemaking, or that it is arbitrary and capricious. A constitutional challenge might argue that the policy violates due process or equal protection.

3.  **Inadequacy of § 1421(c) for Policy Challenges:** Requiring every applicant to go through the individual denial process and then judicial review under § 1421(c) to challenge a fundamentally flawed policy would be inefficient, burdensome, and potentially futile. A court reviewing an individual denial might be able to find the policy unlawful *as applied* to that applicant, but it doesn't necessarily provide a mechanism for a systemic challenge or a declaration that the policy is *facially* unlawful or unconstitutional for *all* applicants.

4.  **Presumption of Judicial Review:** There is a strong presumption in favor of judicial review of agency action, especially for constitutional claims. Preclusion of judicial review must be clear and convincing. Courts generally interpret specific review provisions (like § 1421(c)) as providing a remedy for individual grievances, not as displacing broader challenges to agency policies or practices, particularly when those challenges are systemic or constitutional in nature.

5.  **Jurisdictional Basis for Policy Challenges:** Federal district courts typically have jurisdiction over APA and constitutional challenges under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question jurisdiction).

**Conclusion:** While 8 U.S.C. § 1421(c) provides a specific avenue for judicial review of individual naturalization denials, it does not typically preclude federal courts from exercising their general federal question jurisdiction to hear separate APA and constitutional challenges to the underlying USCIS policies that affect a class of applicants. Courts recognize the distinction between reviewing the application of a policy in an individual case and reviewing the legality of the policy itself.",[],,0.8477605581283569,17.002721088435376,10.564897959183696
"Under what circumstances might a U.S. federal court find that the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying an H-1B visa petition for a computer systems analyst position, specifically concerning the determination of whether the position qualifies as a ""specialty occupation"" based on the normal minimum degree requirement and industry common practice?","A U.S. federal court found that USCIS acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying an H-1B visa petition for a computer systems analyst position by disregarding or failing to explain why it discounted substantial evidence in the administrative record.

The ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard, derived from the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), means that the agency's decision must be based on a reasoned consideration of all relevant factors and must not be so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.

Here are key scenarios where a federal court might intervene:

1.  **Ignoring or Misinterpreting Substantial Evidence Provided by the Petitioner:**
    *   **Detailed Job Duties:** The petitioner provides extensive documentation demonstrating that the specific computer systems analyst role involves highly complex and specialized duties (e.g., designing intricate system architectures, implementing advanced cybersecurity protocols, developing sophisticated data migration strategies, managing complex cloud environments) that clearly require a bachelor's degree or higher in a specific specialty (e.g., Computer Science, Information Systems, Software Engineering, Cybersecurity). If USCIS dismisses these detailed duties with a boilerplate statement that they are ""too general"" or ""entry-level"" without specific analysis of the evidence, a court may find this arbitrary.
    *   **Expert Opinion Letters:** The petitioner submits credible expert opinion letters from academics or industry leaders explaining why the specific computer systems analyst position, with its outlined duties, requires a bachelor's degree in a specialized field and is common practice in the industry. If USCIS disregards these letters without providing a reasoned explanation for their rejection (e.g., not just saying ""the expert is not an adjudicator,"" but explaining *why* the expert's analysis is flawed or irrelevant), it could be arbitrary.
    *   **Industry Standards and Surveys:** The petitioner provides industry surveys, reports, or reputable job postings for similar computer systems analyst roles that consistently show a bachelor's degree as the minimum entry requirement. If USCIS ignores this evidence or selectively cites only the lowest common denominator from the Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH) without addressing the specific evidence for the *particular position* and *industry segment*, a court might find it arbitrary.

2.  **Misapplication or Misinterpretation of the ""Specialty Occupation"" Criteria:**
    *   **""Normally"" Requirement:** USCIS often misinterprets the ""normally requires"" language in the specialty occupation definition. If the OOH states that ""many"" or ""most"" computer systems analysts have a bachelor's degree, or that a bachelor's degree is ""common,"" USCIS might argue it's not *always* required, thus failing the ""normally"" prong. A court might find this arbitrary if the petitioner demonstrates that for *this specific type* of computer systems analyst role, within *this specific industry segment* or *company*, a bachelor's degree is indeed the normal minimum requirement, and the OOH itself supports a degree as a common entry point. USCIS cannot demand a 100% degree requirement when the statute says ""normally.""
    *   **""Specific Specialty"" Requirement:** USCIS might arbitrarily demand a degree in an overly narrow field (e.g., ""only a degree in 'Advanced Systems Analysis' is acceptable"") when the industry commonly accepts related degrees like Computer Science, Information Technology, Management Information Systems, or various Engineering disciplines for computer systems analyst roles. If the petitioner shows that the required knowledge can be gained through several related specialized degrees, and USCIS insists on an unreasonably narrow interpretation, it could be arbitrary.
    *   **Conflating ""Entry-Level"" with ""Non-Specialty"":** USCIS sometimes denies petitions by asserting that an entry-level position cannot be a specialty occupation. A court might find this arbitrary if the petitioner demonstrates that even entry-level computer systems analyst roles in their organization or industry require a bachelor's degree in a specialized field due to the inherent complexity and specialized knowledge involved from day one.

3.  **Lack of Reasoned Decision-Making or Inconsistent Adjudication:**
    *   **Boilerplate Denials:** USCIS issues a denial that uses generic language, fails to address the specific arguments and evidence presented by the petitioner, or simply reiterates the regulatory definition without explaining *how* the petitioner's evidence falls short. This lack of reasoned analysis is a hallmark of arbitrary and capricious action.
    *   **Inconsistent Application of Policy:** USCIS has previously approved similar computer systems analyst positions for the same employer or in the same industry, but then denies the current petition without explaining any change in policy, interpretation, or factual circumstances. This inconsistency, without justification, can be arbitrary.
    *   **Contradictory Findings:** The denial contains internal contradictions or relies on factual assertions that are directly refuted by the evidence in the record without explanation.

4.  **Imposing Unannounced or Extra-Statutory Requirements:**
    *   USCIS demands evidence beyond what is specified in the regulations or statute, or imposes new, unannounced evidentiary burdens that are not reasonably foreseeable. For example, requiring a specific type of market research that is not standard or feasible for the petitioner.

In essence, a federal court will scrutinize whether USCIS's decision-making process was rational, consistent, and based on a fair consideration of the evidence presented. If USCIS's denial of an H-1B for a computer systems analyst position appears to be based on a predetermined outcome, a misreading of the law, a disregard for compelling evidence, or a failure to provide a coherent explanation, it is likely to be overturned as arbitrary and capricious.",[],,0.8340533971786499,19.649607565011824,4.412000000000035
"Can proceeds from a loan be classified as ""cash"" under 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e) for an EB-5 immigrant investor visa, or must they be considered ""indebtedness"" subject to collateralization requirements?","Proceeds from a loan can be classified as ""cash"" under 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e) for an EB-5 immigrant investor visa.

Instead, they are considered **""indebtedness""** and must meet specific collateralization and liability requirements to qualify as capital.

Here's a breakdown based on 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e):

The regulation defines ""capital"" as:
> ""...cash, cash equivalents, equipment, inventory, other tangible property, **indebtedness secured by assets owned by the alien investor, provided that the alien investor is personally and primarily liable and that the assets of the new commercial enterprise upon which the petition is based are not subject to any claim by the alien investor's creditors,** cash obtained by the alien investor through a loan secured by assets of the new commercial enterprise established by the alien investor in the United States, provided that the alien investor is personally and primarily liable for the loan and that the assets of the new commercial enterprise are not subject to any claim by the alien investor's creditors, or other tangible property.""

Key takeaways from this definition regarding loans:

1.  **Indebtedness is a Specific Category:** The regulation explicitly lists ""indebtedness secured by assets owned by the alien investor"" as a form of qualifying capital, separate from ""cash."" This indicates that USCIS views the *source* of the funds (a loan) as critical, not just their liquid form once received.

2.  **Strict Collateralization Requirements:** For loan proceeds to qualify as capital, the loan must be:
    *   **Secured by assets owned by the alien investor:** The collateral for the loan must be the investor's personal assets (e.g., real estate, other investments), *not* assets of the New Commercial Enterprise (NCE) into which the EB-5 investment is being made.
    *   **Alien investor personally and primarily liable:** The investor must be the primary obligor on the loan, bearing the ultimate responsibility for repayment.
    *   **NCE assets not subject to claim:** The assets of the NCE cannot be used as collateral for the investor's personal loan, nor can the investor's creditors have a claim against the NCE's assets. This ensures the NCE's capital is truly ""at risk"" for the enterprise's success, not merely securing the investor's personal debt.

3.  **""Cash"" vs. ""Indebtedness"":** While the loan proceeds might be deposited into a bank account as ""cash,"" for EB-5 purposes, the *nature* of that capital is derived from indebtedness. USCIS scrutinizes the entire transaction to ensure it meets the ""at risk"" requirements and that the funds are lawfully obtained and properly contributed.

**In summary:** While the physical form of loan proceeds might be liquid cash, for EB-5 visa purposes under 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e), they are treated as **""indebtedness""** and must strictly adhere to the specific requirements for collateralization (using the investor's personal assets) and personal liability to qualify as lawful capital. Simply calling them ""cash"" would bypass these crucial safeguards designed to ensure the integrity and ""at risk"" nature of the EB-5 investment.",[],,0.8345893025398254,15.433579817311877,29.782929534580262
"An agency receives a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for ""records of guidelines, procedures, protocols, or policies"" related to specific practices of its regional courts and judges, such as scheduling hearings and adjudicating motions for continuance.

The agency properly applied FOIA Exemption 6 and satisfied its segregability obligations.","A court would likely rule that the agency's interpretation of the FOIA request was **unreasonably narrow** and, consequently, its search was **inadequate**.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1.  **Interpretation of the Request:**
    *   **FOIA Principle:** Agencies must interpret FOIA requests liberally, in favor of disclosure, and cannot unduly narrow the scope of a request. The agency's interpretation must be reasonable and consistent with the plain language of the request. If a request is ambiguous, the agency generally has a duty to seek clarification from the requester or interpret it broadly.
    *   **Application:** The request sought ""records of guidelines, procedures, protocols, or policies"" related to specific practices of ""its regional courts and judges.""
        *   The agency's interpretation, limiting it to ""official and centrally disseminated policies issued by its chief judicial office,"" adds significant qualifiers (""official,"" ""centrally disseminated,"" ""chief judicial office"") that are not present in the requester's language.
        *   The phrase ""regional courts and judges"" strongly suggests that policies or procedures *at the regional or local level* would be responsive, regardless of whether they were centrally issued or disseminated. It is common for local judicial offices to develop their own operating procedures or guidelines to implement broader policies or address specific local needs.
    *   **Conclusion:** The court would likely find that the agency's interpretation was an impermissible narrowing of the request, failing to give due weight to the plain language referring to ""regional courts and judges.""

2.  **Adequacy of the Search:**
    *   **FOIA Principle:** An agency must conduct a search ""reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents."" The agency bears the burden of demonstrating that its search was adequate. This requires searching in all places where responsive records are likely to be found.
    *   **Application:**
        *   Given the agency's unreasonably narrow interpretation, its search was inherently flawed. By limiting its search to only the chief judicial office and its public-facing intranet, the agency deliberately excluded potential repositories of responsive documents.
        *   The requester's argument that ""local operating procedures or policies that might be established and held by assistant chief judges or individual courts"" is highly plausible and directly aligns with the request's reference to ""regional courts and judges."" It is reasonable to expect that such local policies or guidelines would exist and would be responsive to the request.
        *   The agency's failure to search these obvious potential locations (e.g., individual regional courts, offices of assistant chief judges, or internal, non-public intranets/shared drives used by those offices) means its search was not ""reasonably calculated"" to find all responsive records.
    *   **Conclusion:** The court would find the search inadequate because it failed to explore all logical and likely places where responsive documents, particularly local policies or procedures, would be kept, based on a proper, broad interpretation of the request.

**Court's Ruling:**

The court should rule:

1.  **The agency's interpretation of the FOIA request was unreasonably narrow.** The request encompasses both centrally issued and locally established guidelines, procedures, protocols, or policies related to the practices of regional courts and judges.
2.  **The agency's search was inadequate.** By limiting its search based on an unreasonable interpretation, the agency failed to conduct a search ""reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.""

The court would likely order the agency to:
*   Reinterpret the request broadly, consistent with the plain language.
*   Conduct a new, more comprehensive search, including inquiries with regional courts, assistant chief judges, and other relevant personnel or offices where local policies or procedures might be maintained.
*   Submit a new declaration (e.g., a *Vaughn* index or affidavit) detailing the expanded search efforts and the results.",[],,0.8334376811981201,14.762342202601122,24.72333910034604
"An individual received a Notice to Appear (NTA) for removal proceedings that omitted the specific date and time of the hearing.

They submitted an affidavit attesting to non-receipt. They also requested the immigration judge exercise sua sponte authority to reopen the case.

Based on the provided Fifth Circuit decision, what is the likely outcome of their appeal regarding the rescission of the in absentia order and the denial of the motion to reopen?","The appeal would likely be denied in part and dismissed in part.

Here's a breakdown of the likely outcome for each argument:

1.  **Jurisdictionally Defective NTA Argument:**
    *   **Fifth Circuit Stance:** The Fifth Circuit has consistently held that an initial Notice to Appear (NTA) that omits the specific date and time of the hearing is *not* jurisdictionally defective for the purpose of initiating removal proceedings, provided that a subsequent Notice of Hearing (NOH) supplies the missing information. The Fifth Circuit distinguishes Supreme Court cases like *Pereira v. Sessions* and *Niz-Chavez v. Garland*, interpreting them as applying to specific statutory provisions (like the stop-time rule or continuous physical presence) rather than the Immigration Judge's fundamental jurisdiction to hear the case. They view the requirements of 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a) as ""claim-processing rules,"" not jurisdictional prerequisites.
    *   **Likely Outcome:** The Fifth Circuit would likely find that the subsequent NOH, which provided all necessary details, cured any defect in the initial NTA and properly vested the Immigration Judge with jurisdiction. This argument for rescission would fail.

2.  **Non-Receipt of Notices and Rescission of In Absentia Order:**
    *   **Fifth Circuit Stance:** To rescind an in absentia order based on lack of notice, the individual must demonstrate they ""did not receive notice in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a)."" Notice sent via regular mail to the most recent address provided by the alien is considered proper notice. The Fifth Circuit, like other circuits, applies a strong presumption that a properly mailed document is received. A bare affidavit of non-receipt, especially after a significant delay (like 15 years), is generally considered insufficient to overcome this presumption. The individual would need to present ""affirmative evidence"" or ""sufficiently compelling evidence"" beyond a self-serving affidavit to rebut the presumption of receipt.
    *   **Likely Outcome:** Given that the NOH was sent via regular mail and the individual's only evidence is an affidavit of non-receipt 15 years later, the Fifth Circuit would likely find this insufficient to overcome the presumption of receipt. Therefore, the claim for rescission based on non-receipt would fail.

3.  **Denial of Motion to Reopen:**
    *   **Fifth Circuit Stance:** A motion to reopen is subject to strict time and number limits (generally 90 days and one motion). While there are exceptions for in absentia orders if the alien can prove lack of notice or exceptional circumstances, the failure to prove non-receipt (as discussed above) would mean these exceptions do not apply. The 15-year delay is far outside the normal filing period.
    *   **Likely Outcome:** Since the underlying grounds for rescission (lack of notice due to a jurisdictionally defective NTA or actual non-receipt) are unlikely to succeed, the motion to reopen would also be denied.

4.  **Sua Sponte Authority to Reopen:**
    *   **Fifth Circuit Stance:** The Fifth Circuit has consistently held that the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision *not* to exercise its *sua sponte* authority to reopen proceedings is a discretionary decision that is *unreviewable* by the circuit court. The court finds there are ""no meaningful standards"" by which to review such a decision.
    *   **Likely Outcome:** The Fifth Circuit would dismiss this portion of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, refusing to review the denial of the request for *sua sponte* reopening.

**In summary, the Fifth Circuit would likely affirm the denial of the motion to rescind the in absentia order and the denial of the motion to reopen, finding that the Immigration Judge had jurisdiction, the individual failed to overcome the presumption of receipt of the NOH, and the decision not to exercise sua sponte authority is unreviewable.**",[],,0.8528993725776672,14.794982781456955,32.021540397351

Here's a breakdown of the legal reasoning:

**I. Standard for Withdrawing a Guilty Plea Post-Sentence**

After sentencing, a defendant may withdraw a guilty plea only to correct a ""manifest injustice."" This is a high standard, and the defendant bears the burden of proving that such an injustice occurred. A plea is considered a manifest injustice if it was not entered knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.

**II. Analysis of Defendant's Arguments**

The defendant raises two primary arguments, which are interconnected:

**A. Limited English Proficiency (LEP) and Lack of Interpreter**

1.  **Duty to Ensure Understanding:** A guilty plea must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. This requires the defendant to understand the nature of the charges, the rights being waived, and the direct consequences of the plea. When a defendant has a language barrier, the court has an affirmative duty to ensure that the defendant understands the proceedings.
2.  **Notice to the Court:** The fact that an earlier arraignment entry was stamped ""Order Interpreter – Swahili"" is highly significant. This stamp put the court on notice that the defendant likely had a language barrier requiring an interpreter. Even though the defendant did not *request* an interpreter at the plea hearing, the court was already aware of the potential need. The court's failure to provide an interpreter at the plea hearing, despite this prior notice, raises serious questions about whether the defendant truly understood the proceedings.
3.  **Indication of Understanding vs. Actual Understanding:** While the defendant indicated understanding when the court read the immigration consequences form, this alone may not be sufficient to overcome the language barrier, especially when complex legal concepts are involved. A simple ""yes"" or nod might not reflect a deep comprehension of the nuances of deportation, exclusion, or denial of naturalization, particularly if the defendant's English proficiency is limited. The prior ""Order Interpreter"" stamp strongly suggests that the defendant's understanding of English was, at best, limited.

**B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (IAC) Regarding Immigration Consequences**

1.  **The *Strickland* Standard:** To prove IAC, the defendant must show:
    *   **Deficient Performance:** Counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.
    *   **Prejudice:** There is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.
2.  **Duty to Advise on Immigration Consequences (*Padilla v. Kentucky*):** The Supreme Court in *Padilla v. Kentucky* (2010) held that counsel has an affirmative duty to advise non-citizen clients about the immigration consequences of a guilty plea. If the immigration consequences are ""truly clear,"" counsel must provide accurate advice. If the law is ""unclear or uncertain,"" counsel must advise that the plea may carry a risk of adverse immigration consequences.
3.  **Application to this Case:** A first-degree misdemeanor assault charge is very likely to be considered a ""crime involving moral turpitude"" or, depending on the specific statute and sentence, an ""aggravated felony"" for immigration purposes, making the defendant deportable. Counsel therefore had a clear duty to advise the defendant of these severe consequences.
4.  **Counsel's Failure:** The fact that the court read a form to the defendant does not absolve counsel of their independent duty to advise. Counsel must ensure their client understands the advice, especially given the known language barrier. If counsel failed to adequately explain the specific and severe immigration consequences in a way the defendant could comprehend (perhaps by not ensuring an interpreter was present or by not explaining it thoroughly themselves), their performance was deficient.
5.  **Prejudice:** The defendant explicitly states that if properly advised, they ""would have gone to trial."" This satisfies the prejudice prong under *Padilla*, which requires the defendant to show a reasonable probability that they would have rejected the plea and insisted on going to trial. Given the severity of potential deportation, this claim is credible.

**III. Conclusion**

The combination of these factors strongly suggests a manifest injustice:

*   The court was on notice of the defendant's language barrier but failed to provide an interpreter at the critical plea hearing. This undermines the voluntariness and knowing nature of the plea.
*   Trial counsel likely provided ineffective assistance by failing to adequately advise the non-citizen defendant of the severe immigration consequences of an assault conviction, as required by *Padilla v. Kentucky*, especially given the known language barrier.
*   The defendant's claim that they would have gone to trial if properly advised satisfies the prejudice requirement for IAC.

Given the totality of the circumstances, particularly the prior ""Order Interpreter"" stamp and the clear duty under *Padilla*, the trial court **should grant the motion to withdraw the guilty plea** because the plea was likely not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, and the defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel.",[],,0.8306633830070496,13.866451156812339,30.28965102827766
"A software services company, ""GlobalTech Solutions,"" had its H-1B visa petition for a ""Senior Software Engineer"" denied by USCIS on the grounds that it failed to demonstrate the position was a ""specialty occupation"" and did not provide sufficient details on job duties. GlobalTech now seeks to intervene in an ongoing lawsuit filed by another company, ""Innovate Systems,"" whose H-1B petition for a ""Project Manager IT"" was also denied by USCIS for similar reasons (failure to prove specialty occupation and employment relationship). GlobalTech argues that both cases involve common questions of law under the APA regarding USCIS's arbitrary and capricious denials. Should the court grant GlobalTech Solutions' motion for permissive intervention under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b)?","No, the court should deny GlobalTech Solutions' motion for permissive intervention. Intervention would be inappropriate because it would result in undue delay and the two companies' cases are factually distinct. USCIS's review of H-1B visa petitions is fact-intensive and courts' review is limited to the administrative record. The two companies' petitions would not share a single piece of evidence in common, and the job positions, while broadly involving computer technology, would have significantly varying specific functional responsibilities (e.g., ""Senior Software Engineer"" versus ""Project Manager IT""). Furthermore, Innovate Systems' case likely involves an additional legal question (proving an employer-employee relationship) not present in GlobalTech's case, which could prove dispositive and adds complexity. Given these distinct factual and legal natures, reviewing separate agency decisions and records would inject unnecessary complexity and delay into the existing case. The desire of counsel to coordinate a litigation strategy does not constitute a practical purpose that justifies intervention and would conflict with local rules for random case assignment.",,,,,,,,"No, the court should deny GlobalTech Solutions' motion for permissive intervention.

Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

**Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b) - Permissive Intervention**

Rule 24(b) states that a court *may* permit anyone to intervene who:
1.  Is given a conditional right to intervene by a federal statute; or
2.  Has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a **common question of law or fact.**

In exercising its discretion, the court must consider whether the intervention will **unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties' rights.**

**Application to GlobalTech's Motion:**

1.  **Timeliness:** The question doesn't provide information on when GlobalTech filed its motion, so we'll assume for this analysis that it was timely.

2.  **Common Question of Law or Fact:**
    *   **Apparent Commonality:** Both GlobalTech and Innovate Systems are challenging USCIS H-1B denials under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), alleging arbitrary and capricious decisions. Both cases involve the ""specialty occupation"" criterion. This presents a superficial commonality regarding the *legal standard* for reviewing USCIS decisions and the interpretation of ""specialty occupation.""
    *   **Significant Differences:**
        *   **Distinct Factual Scenarios:** While both involve ""specialty occupation,"" the specific job duties, educational requirements, industry standards, and evidence presented for a ""Senior Software Engineer"" (GlobalTech) will be significantly different from those for a ""Project Manager IT"" (Innovate Systems). The court would have to delve into two entirely separate factual records to determine if each specific position qualifies as a specialty occupation.
        *   **Additional Issue for Innovate Systems:** Innovate Systems' petition was *also* denied for failure to prove an ""employment relationship."" This is a distinct legal and factual issue that GlobalTech's case does not share. Allowing GlobalTech to intervene would not contribute to resolving this specific issue for Innovate Systems.

3.  **Undue Delay or Prejudice:**
    *   **Increased Complexity and Delay:** Permitting GlobalTech to intervene would significantly complicate the lawsuit. The court would need to manage discovery, motions, and potentially trial for two distinct factual scenarios and one additional legal issue. This would inevitably delay the resolution of Innovate Systems' original claim.
    *   **Prejudice to Original Parties:** Innovate Systems, the original plaintiff, could be prejudiced by the added complexity and delay, as its case would become entangled with GlobalTech's separate factual dispute.
    *   **Lack of Judicial Economy:** While there's a shared legal framework (APA review), the highly fact-specific nature of H-1B specialty occupation determinations for different job roles, coupled with Innovate's unique ""employment relationship"" issue, means that combining the cases would likely *not* lead to significant judicial economy. Instead, it would likely create a more cumbersome and less efficient proceeding.

**Conclusion:**

Given the significant factual differences between the two job positions and the additional legal issue (employment relationship) present only in Innovate Systems' case, the common questions of law are not substantial enough to warrant permissive intervention. The potential for undue delay, increased complexity, and prejudice to the original parties would outweigh any minimal benefit of shared legal questions.

Therefore, the court should likely **deny** GlobalTech Solutions' motion for permissive intervention under FRCP 24(b). GlobalTech should pursue its own separate lawsuit.",[],,0.8290693759918213,15.86614011741683,17.71618864970648
"A U.S. federal agency, seeking to withhold internal communications under the Freedom of Information Act's Exemption 5, claims that disclosing these documents would ""discourage the expression of candid opinions and inhibit the free and frank exchange of information among agency personnel,"" and ""could adversely impact the free flow of advice and information and could chill interactions and communications between agency employees and their legal counsel.""

Here's why:

1.  **Agency's Burden of Proof:** Under FOIA, the burden is on the agency to demonstrate that *each* withheld document falls squarely within a claimed exemption. This burden is not met by conclusory statements.

2.  **Insufficient Vaughn Index:** A proper Vaughn index (or similar declaration) must provide a detailed justification for each withholding. It needs to:
    *   Describe each withheld document or category of documents.
    *   State the specific exemption claimed.
    *   Explain *how* the exemption applies to the *particular information* in *each* document, without revealing the privileged information itself.
    *   Crucially, it must provide enough information for the court (and the requester) to make an independent assessment of the agency's claims.

3.  **Lack of Specificity and Particularization:** The agency's use of uniform, generic phrases like ""discourage candid opinions"" or ""chill interactions"" for various documents, without linking the asserted harm to the specific content or context of each record, is a common reason for courts to reject FOIA exemption claims. Courts require more than ""boilerplate"" language; they need a particularized explanation for *each* document.

4.  **Judicial Scrutiny:** Federal courts conduct a *de novo* review of agency withholding decisions. They will not simply defer to an agency's generalized assertions of harm. They need to be able to understand the nature of the document and the specific reasons why its disclosure would genuinely undermine the deliberative process, attorney-client privilege, or attorney work-product privilege.

5.  **Exemption 5 Requirements:**
    *   **Deliberative Process Privilege:** To invoke this, the agency must show the document is both ""pre-decisional"" (generated before the adoption of an agency policy or decision) and ""deliberative"" (reflects the give-and-take of the consultative process). The boilerplate language hints at the *purpose* of this privilege but doesn't demonstrate its *application* to specific documents.
    *   **Attorney-Client Privilege:** This requires a confidential communication between an attorney and client for the purpose of seeking or rendering legal advice. The agency must show this for each document.
    *   **Attorney Work-Product Privilege:** This protects documents prepared by or for an attorney in anticipation of litigation. Again, specific facts are needed.

**Likely Court Action:**

Instead of upholding the withholdings, a federal court would most likely:

*   **Order the agency to submit a more detailed and particularized Vaughn index or declaration.**
*   **Order the agency to submit the documents for *in camera* review** (where the judge reviews the documents privately) to determine if the exemptions apply.
*   If the agency fails to provide adequate justification after being given an opportunity, the court could ultimately **order the disclosure of the withheld documents.**

In summary, while the phrases used by the agency touch upon the *purposes* of Exemption 5, their uniform and unspecific application across various documents fails to meet the stringent requirements for justifying withholdings under FOIA.",[],,0.8510104417800903,14.539797516198707,25.180092242620617
"After being convicted of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud and ordered to pay over $200,000 in restitution, an individual is found removable as an aggravated felon. If this individual, while detained and proceeding pro se, files a petition for review of the BIA's order 31 days after it was mailed, can they successfully challenge the use of the restitution amount to establish the aggravated felony, or argue ineffective assistance of counsel in their immigration proceedings?","No, the individual in this situation would likely not successfully challenge the use of the restitution amount to establish the aggravated felony, nor could they argue ineffective assistance of counsel in their immigration proceedings if not properly raised before the BIA.

Firstly, the court would likely have jurisdiction to hear the petition for review, despite it being received 31 days after the BIA order was mailed, because the ""prison mailbox rule"" (Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 25(a)(2)(A)(iii)) applies to pro se detainees in immigration proceedings. This rule deems a filing timely if it is deposited in the institution's internal mail system on or before the last day for filing, with a compliant certificate of service or evidence of deposit.

Secondly, regarding the aggravated felony determination, a restitution order tied to a fraud conspiracy conviction, clearly showing a loss to victims exceeding $10,000, provides clear and convincing evidence to establish that the conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M). The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) is permitted to rely on such sentencing-related material to determine the amount of loss, and the individual's restitution order for $229,717.30 linked to their conviction would be sufficient evidence.

Finally, any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel concerning immigration proceedings cannot be considered by the court if the individual failed to first raise it before the BIA on direct appeal or in a motion to reopen. Failure to exhaust an issue before the BIA is a jurisdictional bar for the appellate court.

Failure to exhaust an issue before the BIA is a jurisdictional bar for the appellate court. Additionally, other unreasoned and unsupported claims would likely be considered abandoned.","No, it is highly unlikely the individual can successfully challenge either the use of the restitution amount or argue ineffective assistance of counsel in a petition for review filed 31 days after the BIA's order was mailed.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1.  **Timeliness of the Petition for Review (PFR):**
    *   **Strict Deadline:** Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1), a petition for review must be filed ""not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal."" This deadline is **jurisdictional**, meaning if the petition is filed even one day late, the Circuit Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction to hear the case and must dismiss it.
    *   **Application:** The BIA's order was *mailed* on a certain date, and the PFR was filed 31 days later. Courts generally count the 30 days from the date the BIA's order was issued/entered, not from the date of receipt. Therefore, filing on day 31 makes the petition untimely.
    *   **Pro Se/Detained Status:** While courts sometimes grant leniency to *pro se* litigants regarding procedural technicalities, the 30-day deadline for a petition for review in immigration cases is a strict jurisdictional bar that is almost never waived, even for *pro se* or detained individuals.

2.  **Challenge to the Restitution Amount for Aggravated Felony Determination:**
    *   **Aggravated Felony Definition:** For fraud or deceit offenses (like bank and wire fraud), an aggravated felony includes offenses ""in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000."" (INA § 101(a)(43)(M)(i)).
    *   **Supreme Court Precedent (Nijhawan v. Holder, 2009):** The Supreme Court held that the ""loss to the victim"" for purposes of this aggravated felony definition refers to the actual loss caused by the specific offense of conviction, and that a restitution order is generally a reliable indicator of that loss.
    *   **Application:** The individual was ordered to pay over $200,000 in restitution, which far exceeds the $10,000 threshold. Given *Nijhawan*, it would be extremely difficult to successfully challenge the use of this restitution amount to establish the aggravated felony. The individual would need to demonstrate that the restitution order itself was not tied to the offense of conviction or was otherwise fundamentally flawed in a way that impacts the immigration determination, which is a high bar.

3.  **Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (IAC) Claim:**
    *   **Exhaustion Requirement:** Generally, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel must first be raised before the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) (or the Immigration Judge, if applicable) through a motion to reopen or a direct appeal to the BIA. Circuit Courts of Appeals typically review the BIA's decision based on the administrative record and do not consider new factual claims or evidence that were not presented to the agency.
    *   **Requirements for IAC Claim (Matter of Lozada):** To successfully raise an IAC claim before the BIA, the respondent must generally:
        1.  Provide an affidavit setting forth the agreement with counsel, counsel's actions/inactions, and any complaints.
        2.  Inform counsel of the allegations and give counsel an opportunity to respond.
        3.  Show that but for counsel's errors, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different (prejudice).
    *   **Application:** Since the individual is raising this claim for the first time in a petition for review, it was almost certainly not exhausted before the BIA. The Circuit Court would likely dismiss the IAC claim for lack of jurisdiction or for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

**Conclusion:**

The individual faces significant hurdles. The most immediate and likely fatal flaw is the **untimely filing of the petition for review**. Even if that hurdle could somehow be overcome (which is highly improbable), challenging the use of the restitution amount would be very difficult due to Supreme Court precedent, and the ineffective assistance of counsel claim would likely be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.",[],,0.8394900560379028,14.280203252032518,34.81073639774863

Here's why:

1.  **The REAL ID Act of 2005:** This act significantly consolidated judicial review of most immigration matters, particularly those related to removal orders, into the U.S. Courts of Appeals.
2.  **8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5):** This crucial statutory provision states that ""a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals... shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal entered or issued under any provision of this Act.""
3.  **""Related to"" an Order of Removal:** Courts have broadly interpreted § 1252(a)(5) to encompass not just the removal order itself, but also any decision or action that is ""part of"" or ""arises from"" the removal process, or that seeks to challenge or circumvent an existing removal order.
4.  **Adjustment of Status as Relief from Removal:** An adjustment of status application is a form of relief from removal. When an alien has an outstanding order of removal, any attempt to adjust status is directly related to their ability to avoid or overcome that removal order.
5.  **Denial of Jurisdiction by USCIS:** Even if USCIS denies jurisdiction over the adjustment application (rather than denying the application on the merits), this decision is still considered ""related to"" the removal proceedings and the outstanding removal order. It's a procedural step within the broader context of the alien's immigration status, which is dominated by the removal order.

Therefore, an APA challenge to such a decision would be considered an attempt to collaterally attack or review a matter exclusively reserved for the Courts of Appeals under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5). The proper forum for challenging such a decision would be a petition for review filed directly with the appropriate U.S. Court of Appeals, not a federal district court.",[],,0.8818414211273193,14.885109890109891,29.69096153846155
"A noncitizen worker's I-140 immigrant work visa petition was revoked by USCIS thirteen years after its approval, despite the worker having activated the ""job portability"" provision by changing employers after 180 days of their I-485 application pending.

Here's a breakdown of the legal principles involved:

1.  **Presumption of Judicial Review:** Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), there is a strong presumption that final agency actions are subject to judicial review unless Congress explicitly precludes it.

2.  **Immigration-Specific Preclusion Clauses:** The INA, particularly 8 U.S.C. § 1252 (INA 242), contains several provisions that limit or preclude judicial review of certain immigration decisions. For example, discretionary decisions are often shielded from review.

3.  **Exception for Questions of Law:** Crucially, INA 242(a)(2)(D) states: ""Nothing in subparagraph (B) or (C), or in any other provision of this Act (other than this section) which limits or precludes judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or **questions of law** raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section."" While this section often refers to petitions for review in the Court of Appeals, federal district courts also have jurisdiction to review certain agency actions, especially those involving the interpretation or application of statutes.

4.  **Application to I-140 Revocation and AC21 Portability:**
    *   The worker's claim is that they activated the ""job portability"" provision under the American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act (AC21), specifically INA 204(j) (8 U.S.C. § 1154(j)). This provision allows an I-140 petition to remain valid for adjustment of status purposes if the I-485 has been pending for 180 days or more, and the new job is in the ""same or similar occupational classification.""
    *   If USCIS revoked the I-140 *despite* the worker meeting the statutory requirements for AC21 portability, this would likely constitute an **error of law** or a misapplication of the statute. The question of whether AC21 applies, or whether USCIS correctly interpreted ""same or similar occupational classification"" in the context of the worker's new job, are questions of law that federal courts are empowered to review.
    *   For example, if USCIS revoked the I-140 because the original employer withdrew it, but the worker had already ported, USCIS's action would be contrary to the plain language and intent of AC21. Such an action would be reviewable.
    *   Even if USCIS's revocation was based on a determination that the new job was *not* in a ""same or similar occupational classification,"" the interpretation of that statutory phrase and its application to the facts can be challenged as a question of law.

5.  **Application to I-765 Denial:** The denial of the I-765 (Employment Authorization Document) is a direct consequence of the I-140 revocation. If the I-140 revocation is successfully challenged and overturned by a federal court, the I-765 denial would likely also be reversed, as the underlying basis for employment authorization (a pending I-485 based on a valid I-140) would be restored. Therefore, the I-765 denial would be reviewable as part of the challenge to the I-140 revocation.

**Conclusion:**

Given that the worker asserts they met the conditions for AC21 job portability, USCIS's subsequent revocation of the I-140 petition thirteen years later, and the denial of the I-765, strongly suggests a potential misapplication or misinterpretation of INA 204(j) (AC21). Such a challenge would fall squarely within the ""questions of law"" exception to judicial review preclusion under INA 242(a)(2)(D). Therefore, a federal court would likely have jurisdiction to review these agency actions. The worker would typically file a complaint in a U.S. District Court seeking review under the APA.",[],,0.8380964398384094,15.46683570736073,29.320335595495578

1.  **Grant a Preliminary Injunction:** The court would likely grant the preliminary injunction, finding that the applicant has a strong likelihood of success on the merits and faces irreparable harm.

    *   **Likelihood of Success on the Merits:** The most compelling factor is that the very USCIS policy used to deny the petition has since been invalidated by a federal court. This means USCIS applied an unlawful standard, making the denial arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law (a common standard for judicial review of agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act).
    *   **Irreparable Harm:** The applicant faces significant irreparable harm, including loss of employment, potential loss of legal status in the U.S., forced departure, and disruption of their life and career. Monetary damages would not adequately compensate for these harms.
    *   **Balance of Equities and Public Interest:** The balance of equities would favor the applicant, as the government's interest in enforcing an unlawful policy is minimal, while the public interest lies in ensuring agencies follow the law and do not act arbitrarily.

2.  **Vacate the USCIS Denial:** The court would likely vacate (nullify) the original denial of the H-1B petition, as it was based on an unlawful policy.

3.  **Remand the Petition to USCIS for Re-adjudication:** The court would typically **not** approve the H-1B petition itself. Instead, it would remand (send back) the petition to USCIS with instructions to:
    *   **Re-adjudicate the petition:** USCIS would be ordered to review the petition again.
    *   **Apply the correct legal standard:** USCIS would be explicitly instructed to adjudicate the petition *without* applying the invalidated policy regarding specific, non-speculative work assignments for the entire visa duration. They would need to apply the standards that existed prior to or independent of that unlawful policy.
    *   **Consider all other relevant factors:** USCIS would still be able to deny the petition based on other valid legal grounds if they exist, but not on the previously invalidated policy.

4.  **Regarding Immigration Status (during re-adjudication):**
    *   The preliminary injunction would likely **prevent USCIS from taking any adverse action** against the applicant based on the vacated denial while the petition is being re-adjudicated.
    *   If the applicant was already in the U.S. and had maintained status (e.g., through a change of status or extension of stay) while the petition was pending, the injunction might temporarily restore or preserve their status and work authorization until USCIS makes a new decision. This is crucial to prevent the applicant from being forced to leave the country or lose their job while their case is being lawfully reviewed. The exact scope of this temporary relief would depend on the specific circumstances and the court's order.

In essence, the District Court would act to correct the legal error made by USCIS, ensuring the applicant's petition is reviewed fairly under the correct legal framework, and providing temporary relief to prevent immediate harm while that review takes place.",[],,0.8357383608818054,14.508859910581226,30.54955290611028
"A Christian leader from El Salvador, Samuel Argueta-Hernandez, was repeatedly threatened by MS-13 gang members after he refused to pay extortion and collaborate with them, with later threats explicitly mentioning his religious leadership.

**I. Standards of Review**

1.  **Factual Findings:** The BIA's factual findings (e.g., severity of harm, government's willingness to protect) are reviewed under the **substantial evidence standard**. This means the BIA's findings must be supported by ""reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole."" The Court cannot substitute its judgment for the BIA's simply because it would have reached a different conclusion, but it must reverse if the BIA's decision is ""so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.""
2.  **Legal Conclusions:** The BIA's legal conclusions (e.g., interpretation of ""persecution,"" ""on account of,"" or ""torture"") are reviewed **de novo**, meaning without deference to the BIA. However, the Court generally defers to the BIA's reasonable interpretations of ambiguous immigration statutes under *Chevron* deference.
3.  **Mixed Questions of Law and Fact:** These are often reviewed under the substantial evidence standard, especially when applying legal standards to specific facts.

**II. Review of BIA's Specific Reasons for Denial**

The Court of Appeals would likely find significant issues with each of the BIA's reasons, potentially leading to a reversal or remand of the decision.

**A. ""Harm was not severe enough due to lack of physical injury.""**

*   **Legal Error/Lack of Substantial Evidence:** This finding is highly problematic.
    *   **Persecution (Withholding of Removal):** Persecution does not require physical injury. Repeated death threats, extortion attempts, and especially an *attempted assassination of his son* are severe forms of harm that can constitute persecution. The BIA's focus solely on the lack of physical injury to the applicant himself is a misapplication of the law. Persecution includes threats to life or freedom, or a pattern of harassment that rises to a severe level.
    *   **Torture (CAT):** Torture is defined as severe pain or suffering, physical or mental. The constant fear for one's life and the lives of family members, especially after an assassination attempt on his son, clearly constitutes severe mental suffering. The BIA's narrow interpretation of harm for CAT purposes would likely be found to be legally erroneous.

**B. ""Nexus to his religion was insufficient as the gang's primary motive was extortion.""**

*   **Legal Error/Lack of Substantial Evidence:** This finding misapplies the ""on account of"" standard for withholding of removal.
    *   **""One Central Reason"" Standard:** For withholding of removal, the protected ground (religion, in this case) does not have to be the *sole* or *primary* motive for persecution. It only needs to be ""one central reason"" for the persecution. The prompt explicitly states that later threats ""explicitly mentioning his religious leadership."" This is strong evidence of a religious nexus.
    *   **Mixed Motives:** Persecutors often have mixed motives. Even if extortion was *a* motive, if Argueta-Hernandez's religious leadership made him a target for extortion, or if his refusal to collaborate was rooted in his religious beliefs (e.g., preaching against gang violence, refusing to compromise his moral principles), then his religion could be a central reason for the persecution. The BIA's insistence on ""primary motive"" is contrary to established legal precedent.
    *   **CAT Irrelevance:** Crucially, the Convention Against Torture does *not* require a nexus to a protected ground (like religion). Therefore, this BIA finding is entirely irrelevant to the CAT claim and cannot be a basis for denying CAT protection.

**C. ""The government's temporary safe house and facilitated departure demonstrated a willingness to protect him.""**

*   **Lack of Substantial Evidence/Contradiction of Undisputed Facts:** This finding appears to be directly contradicted by the facts presented in the question.
    *   **Inability to Protect:** The Salvadoran authorities *explicitly told him they could not protect him* and even asked him to sign a liability waiver if he remained. A temporary safe house followed by *facilitated departure* (i.e., helping him leave the country) is not a demonstration of willingness or ability to protect him *within* the country; it's an admission of their inability to do so.
    *   **Internal Relocation:** For withholding of removal, the government must show that the applicant could reasonably relocate to another part of the country where they would not face persecution. Here, the government essentially told him there was no safe place *in the country* and helped him leave.
    *   **Acquiescence (CAT):** For CAT, the torture must be inflicted by or with the acquiescence of a public official. When a government acknowledges danger, states it cannot protect, and facilitates departure, it strongly suggests either an inability to prevent torture or, at minimum, acquiescence to the potential harm by non-state actors. The liability waiver further underscores the government's acknowledgment of the risk and its unwillingness to take responsibility for his safety.

**III. Conclusion**

A U.S. Court of Appeals would likely find that the BIA's decision is not supported by substantial evidence and/or contains legal errors. The BIA's interpretation of ""severe harm"" is too narrow, its application of the ""on account of"" nexus is flawed, and its finding regarding government protection is directly contradicted by the facts.

The Court would likely **reverse** the BIA's decision or **remand** the case back to the BIA for reconsideration consistent with the proper legal standards and a thorough review of the evidence, particularly regarding the severity of harm, the religious nexus, and the Salvadoran government's explicit admission of inability to protect.",[],,0.818295955657959,13.419278656126483,32.926472332015834
Can a U.S. federal court compel USCIS to reverse its discretionary denial of an employment authorization application (Form I-765) and approve it during the pendency of judicial review?,"No, a U.S. federal court cannot compel USCIS to reverse its discretionary denial of an employment authorization application (Form I-765) and approve it during the pendency of judicial review.

Here's why:

1.  **Discretionary Nature of the Decision:** USCIS decisions on employment authorization are often considered discretionary. Courts generally give significant deference to an agency's exercise of its discretion. The court's role is typically to review whether the agency abused its discretion, not to substitute its own judgment for that of the agency.

2.  **Standard of Review:** Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), a federal court can set aside an agency action only if it is ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law."" This is a high bar. To find an ""abuse of discretion,"" the court would need to determine that the agency's decision was irrational, lacked a reasoned basis, failed to consider relevant factors, or relied on irrelevant factors. It does *not* mean the court would have made a different decision.

3.  **Judicial Role vs. Agency Role:** Federal courts review agency actions; they do not typically step into the shoes of the agency to make the initial substantive decision, especially when that decision involves discretion and agency expertise. Compelling approval would essentially be the court making the discretionary decision itself.

4.  **Injunctive Relief (Mandatory Injunctions):** To compel approval during the pendency of review would require a mandatory preliminary injunction. Such injunctions are extraordinary remedies and are rarely granted, especially when they require an agency to take an affirmative action that is within its discretion. The petitioner would need to demonstrate:
    *   A strong likelihood of success on the merits (meaning a strong likelihood the court will find USCIS abused its discretion).
    *   Irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted (often difficult to prove for economic harm, which courts sometimes deem reparable).
    *   The balance of equities favors the petitioner.
    *   The injunction is in the public interest.
    Proving a ""strong likelihood of success"" when challenging a discretionary denial is exceptionally difficult.

**What a Federal Court *Can* Do:**

While a court is unlikely to *compel approval*, it can:

*   **Vacate the Denial:** If the court finds that USCIS abused its discretion (e.g., failed to consider relevant evidence, provided an inadequate explanation, applied the wrong legal standard, or acted arbitrarily), it can vacate the denial.
*   **Remand the Case:** The most common outcome when a court finds fault with a discretionary denial is to **remand the case back to USCIS** with instructions to reconsider the application in light of the court's findings. This means USCIS must re-adjudicate the application, correcting the errors identified by the court. However, even after remand, USCIS could potentially deny the application again if it provides a legally sound and reasoned basis for doing so.
*   **Order Reconsideration:** Similar to a remand, the court can order USCIS to reconsider the application.

In summary, a federal court's power is generally limited to reviewing the legality and rationality of USCIS's discretionary decision, not to making the discretionary decision itself by compelling approval. The most a petitioner can typically hope for is a remand for reconsideration.",[],,0.8422470092773438,13.77196805593639,29.465832533589264

### I. Circumstances Under Which a U.S. Court of Appeals Lacks Jurisdiction to Review a BIA Denial of Cancellation of Removal

The primary statutory provisions limiting judicial review are found in **8 U.S.C. § 1252 (INA § 242)**.

1.  **Discretionary Decisions (INA § 242(a)(2)(B)(i)):**
    *   Courts of Appeals generally lack jurisdiction to review ""any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section... 1229b [cancellation of removal]... or any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security.""
    *   **Meaning:** If the BIA denies cancellation of removal based purely on its discretionary weighing of the equities (e.g., finding that the positive factors do not outweigh the negative factors, or that the alien has not demonstrated sufficient rehabilitation), the Court of Appeals cannot review that discretionary judgment. This includes the ultimate decision of whether to grant or deny the relief.

2.  **Findings of Fact (INA § 242(a)(2)(B)(ii)):**
    *   Courts also lack jurisdiction to review ""any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, other than the granting of relief under section... 1229b [cancellation of removal]... or any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security.""
    *   **Meaning:** This provision, read in conjunction with (B)(i), is interpreted to strip jurisdiction over factual findings made in the context of discretionary relief. For example, if the BIA finds that an alien did not establish ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" (a factual determination based on the evidence presented), or did not meet the ""continuous physical presence"" requirement, the Court of Appeals generally cannot review that factual finding.

3.  **Criminal Aliens (INA § 242(a)(2)(C)):**
    *   ""Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), and except as provided in subparagraph (D), no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section... 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) [aggravated felony], (B), (C), or (D) of this title, or any offense covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii) of this title for which both predicate offenses are, without regard to their date of commission, covered by section 1227(a)(2)(A)(i) of this title.""
    *   **Meaning:** If an alien is removable due to having committed certain specified criminal offenses (most notably, an aggravated felony), the Court of Appeals generally lacks jurisdiction to review *any* final order of removal, including the denial of cancellation of removal. This is a broader jurisdiction strip that applies regardless of whether the denial was discretionary or based on a factual finding.

**Important Exceptions to Jurisdiction Stripping:**

Despite these limitations, Courts of Appeals *retain* jurisdiction to review:

*   **Constitutional Claims:** (INA § 242(a)(2)(D)) – Aliens can challenge BIA decisions on constitutional grounds (e.g., due process violations, equal protection).
*   **Questions of Law:** (INA § 242(a)(2)(D)) – Courts can review ""questions of law"" raised in a petition for review. This is a critical distinction:
    *   A court *cannot* review whether the BIA correctly weighed the equities in a discretionary decision.
    *   A court *can* review whether the BIA applied the correct legal standard for ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship,"" or correctly interpreted a statutory term like ""aggravated felony"" or ""continuous physical presence.""
    *   Procedural errors that rise to the level of a due process violation are often framed as constitutional claims or questions of law, allowing for review.

---

### II. Procedural Requirements to Challenge BIA Procedural Errors on Appeal

To challenge BIA procedural errors on appeal to a U.S. Court of Appeals, an alien must generally meet the following requirements:

1.  **Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies (INA § 242(d)(1)):**
    *   This is the most fundamental requirement. A court may not review a final order of removal unless ""the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.""
    *   **Meaning:** The alien must have raised the specific procedural error before the BIA (or the Immigration Judge, if the error occurred at that level and was appealable to the BIA) and given the agency an opportunity to correct it.
    *   **How to Exhaust:**
        *   **Brief to the BIA:** The procedural error must be clearly articulated in the alien's brief to the BIA. Vague or generalized complaints are usually insufficient.
        *   **Motion to Reconsider/Reopen:** If the procedural error occurred *at the BIA level itself* (e.g., BIA failed to consider evidence, misstated facts, or applied the wrong legal standard in its decision), or if new evidence related to a procedural error becomes available, the alien might need to file a motion to reconsider or a motion to reopen with the BIA to exhaust the issue.

2.  **Specificity of the Objection:**
    *   The objection raised before the BIA must be sufficiently specific to apprise the BIA of the nature of the alleged error. A general assertion of ""due process violation"" without explaining the specific procedural defect will likely not be considered exhausted.

3.  **Prejudice:**
    *   For many procedural errors, especially those framed as due process violations, the alien must demonstrate not only that an error occurred but also that they suffered **prejudice** as a result.
    *   **Meaning:** The error must have potentially affected the outcome of the proceedings. If the error was harmless and would not have changed the result, a court is unlikely to grant relief. For example, if the alien claims they were denied a fair hearing, they must show how that denial deprived them of a meaningful opportunity to present their case and that, but for the error, the outcome might have been different.

4.  **Constitutional or Legal Question:**
    *   As noted above, the procedural error must be framed as a **constitutional claim** (e.g., a violation of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause) or a **question of law** (e.g., the BIA failed to follow its own regulations, which is a legal question). Purely factual disputes about how a procedure was carried out, without a legal or constitutional dimension, may fall outside the court's jurisdiction.

In summary, while the REAL ID Act significantly curtails judicial review of discretionary immigration decisions, aliens can still challenge BIA denials of cancellation of removal based on procedural errors, provided they have properly exhausted their administrative remedies, specifically articulated the error, demonstrated prejudice, and framed the error as a constitutional claim or question of law.",[],,0.8326489925384521,15.796399033816424,25.37003043478265
"A public interest legal organization requests that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) make all of its non-precedential, unpublished opinions publicly available in an electronic format, arguing that FOIA's affirmative disclosure obligations require it.

This power is not limited to merely ordering the production of records to the individual complainant.","Yes, a U.S. federal court can compel the BIA to make these documents publicly available online, rather than just producing them to the organization.

Here's why:

1.  **FOIA's Affirmative Disclosure Obligations (5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2)):** The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) doesn't just allow individuals to request specific documents; it also places affirmative disclosure obligations on agencies. Specifically, Section 552(a)(2) requires agencies to make available for public inspection and copying (and, for records created after November 1, 1996, in an electronic format):
    *   ""final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases;""
    *   ""statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register;"" and
    *   ""administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public.""

    The BIA's ""non-precedential, unpublished opinions"" clearly fall under the category of ""final opinions... made in the adjudication of cases."" Even if they are non-precedential, they represent the agency's application of law to facts and contribute to the body of agency decision-making, which FOIA aims to make transparent.

2.  **Purpose of (a)(2): Preventing ""Secret Law"":** The intent behind Section 552(a)(2) is to prevent agencies from developing ""secret law"" – a body of rules, interpretations, or decisions that guide agency action but are not publicly accessible. Even non-precedential opinions can reveal patterns, interpretations, or practical applications of law that are important for the public (and legal practitioners) to understand.

3.  **Judicial Authority to Compel Compliance:** FOIA grants federal courts jurisdiction to ""enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld"" (5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B)). When an agency fails to comply with its affirmative disclosure obligations under (a)(2) by not making records publicly available as required, it is effectively ""withholding"" those records from the public in violation of the statute.

    Therefore, a court can order the agency to comply with its statutory duty to make the records publicly available in an electronic format, not merely to produce them to the specific requesting party. The BIA's argument that courts can only order production to the requesting party is a misinterpretation of the scope of judicial remedies under FOIA, particularly concerning the affirmative disclosure requirements of (a)(2). The court would be ordering the BIA to fulfill its obligation to the public, not just to the organization.",[],,0.8605448007583618,16.574896099744247,19.75472266624044

The court acts as a ""gatekeeper"" to ensure that expert testimony is both relevant and reliable.

Here's the likelihood for each expert:

1.  **Statistician:**
    *   **Likelihood: Very High.**
    *   **Reasoning:** A statistician's expertise is highly relevant and reliable in a class action lawsuit concerning agency compliance. They can analyze large datasets related to placement rates, durations, demographics of those placed, outcomes, and disparities. This can provide crucial evidence regarding whether ICE is meeting its statutory obligations (e.g., timely placements, equitable treatment) and the systemic impact of its practices.
        *   **Relevance:** Directly addresses ""agency compliance"" by quantifying patterns and deviations, and ""impact of practices"" by identifying correlations between agency actions and outcomes for the young adults.
        *   **Reliability:** Statistical methods are well-established scientific principles. The expert would need to demonstrate that their methodology is sound, the data is sufficient, and their conclusions are reliably derived.
        *   **Potential Challenges:** The court would ensure the statistician does not offer legal conclusions (e.g., ""ICE violated the law"") but rather factual findings based on data analysis (e.g., ""X% of young adults experienced delays exceeding Y days"").

2.  **Former Agency Administrator:**
    *   **Likelihood: High to Moderate.**
    *   **Reasoning:** A former agency administrator can offer valuable insight into the internal workings, policies, procedures, resource allocation, and operational challenges of ICE or similar agencies. This ""insider"" perspective can illuminate the practical realities behind compliance or non-compliance.
        *   **Relevance:** Highly relevant to ""agency compliance"" by explaining how policies are (or are not) implemented, and to ""impact of practices"" by detailing the operational context that leads to certain outcomes.
        *   **Reliability:** Expertise would be based on extensive experience and institutional knowledge. *Kumho Tire* clarified that *Daubert* applies to all expert testimony, including that based on experience.
        *   **Potential Challenges:**
            *   **Scope:** The court would strictly limit the testimony to factual descriptions of agency operations, policies, and their practical effects, rather than legal conclusions or speculation about current intent if the administrator left the agency some time ago.
            *   **Bias:** The court might scrutinize potential bias (e.g., if the administrator left under contentious circumstances or has a vested interest in the outcome), though this often goes to the weight of the testimony rather than admissibility.
            *   **Confidentiality/Privilege:** The court would ensure no privileged information is disclosed.

3.  **Pediatrician:**
    *   **Likelihood: High.**
    *   **Reasoning:** A pediatrician, especially one with expertise in child development, trauma, and the specific needs of vulnerable youth populations (like unaccompanied alien children transitioning to young adulthood), can provide critical testimony on the ""impact of practices.""
        *   **Relevance:** Directly addresses the ""impact of practices"" by explaining the developmental, psychological, and physical health consequences of inadequate placement, instability, lack of appropriate services, or prolonged detention on young adults. This is crucial for demonstrating harm to the class. It can also indirectly inform ""agency compliance"" if statutory obligations are tied to the best interests or specific needs of children/young adults.
        *   **Reliability:** Pediatric medicine and child development are well-established scientific and medical fields. The expert would rely on accepted medical principles, research, and clinical experience.
        *   **Potential Challenges:** The pediatrician would need to focus on the general impacts on the class of young adults, rather than offering specific diagnoses for individual plaintiffs unless they were part of a specific medical evaluation. They would also need to avoid offering legal opinions on whether ICE's actions constitute ""non-compliance,"" instead focusing on the medical and developmental consequences of those actions.

In summary, all three experts have a strong potential for admissibility, provided their testimony is properly scoped to their area of expertise, is based on reliable methods or experience, and avoids offering legal conclusions. The statistician and pediatrician are particularly strong candidates given the nature of the claims regarding systemic impact and harm to a vulnerable population. The former agency administrator's testimony would be valuable for contextualizing agency operations but might face more scrutiny regarding scope and potential bias.",[],,0.8282163143157959,15.944105691056912,13.207127371273742

5.  **Impropriety:** The plaintiff failed to plausibly plead any factual claims of impropriety, offering only conclusory allegations.","It is **challenging but not impossible** for an immigrant investor to successfully sue U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for unreasonable delay in adjudicating a Form I-526 petition under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) or the Mandamus Act, given the circumstances described.

Here's a breakdown of the factors and legal considerations:

**Legal Basis: APA and Mandamus Act**

*   **Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(1):** This section allows a court to ""compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed."" This is the primary statutory basis for challenging agency inaction.
*   **Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1361:** This act grants district courts original jurisdiction over ""any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff."" For a mandamus claim to succeed, the plaintiff must show:
    1.  A clear and indisputable right to relief.
    2.  A clear duty on the part of the defendant to perform the act in question.
    3.  No other adequate remedy available.

In the context of immigration delays, APA and Mandamus claims are often brought together, as USCIS has a clear duty to adjudicate petitions, and there is typically no other administrative remedy for *delay* itself.

**Factors Courts Consider for ""Unreasonable Delay"" (often derived from *TRAC v. FCC* and its progeny):**

1.  **Time agency takes vs. statutory/regulatory limits:** This is a major hurdle for the investor. Since there is **no binding statutory timetable** for I-526 adjudication, courts give USCIS significant deference in managing its workload. If there were a deadline, proving unreasonable delay would be much easier.
2.  **Prejudice to the petitioner:** This is the investor's strongest argument. A 3-4 year delay can cause significant prejudice, including:
    *   **Financial harm:** Funds tied up, business plans disrupted, loss of investment opportunities.
    *   **Personal hardship:** Uncertainty for the investor and their family, potential ""aging out"" of dependent children, inability to plan for the future.
    *   **Business viability:** The EB-5 project itself might be jeopardized by prolonged uncertainty.
    The more severe and demonstrable the prejudice, the stronger the case.
3.  **Effect of delay on agency functions:** Courts are reluctant to intervene if doing so would unduly disrupt the agency's ability to perform its other duties or prioritize its workload. USCIS will argue that a court order to expedite one petition would force it to deprioritize others.
4.  **Number of matters pending before the agency:** USCIS will point to the high volume of I-526 petitions and the complexity of the adjudication process (e.g., source of funds verification, business plan analysis, national security checks) as reasons for the long processing times.
5.  **Complexity of the task:** I-526 petitions are inherently complex, requiring significant due diligence from USCIS.
6.  **Extent to which petitioner contributed to the delay:** Assuming the petitioner has responded promptly to all Requests for Evidence (RFEs) and has not caused any delays, this factor would weigh in their favor.

**Impact of USCIS's Processing Method (Visa Availability and FIFO):**

USCIS's reliance on a ""visa availability and first-in, first-out"" (FIFO) processing method, while rational from an agency management perspective, does not automatically shield it from a delay lawsuit.

*   **FIFO:** While generally fair, an extreme delay even within a FIFO system can still be deemed unreasonable if it's far outside the norm or causes severe prejudice.
*   **Visa Availability:** USCIS might argue that processing petitions for individuals who cannot immediately receive a visa due to retrogression is not the highest priority. However, the I-526 is a petition for *eligibility*, not the visa itself, and its approval is a prerequisite for the visa application.

**Likelihood of Success:**

*   **The 3-4 year delay is significant:** While there's no statutory deadline, a delay of this magnitude is substantial enough to potentially cross the threshold of ""unreasonable"" in the eyes of a court, especially if the petitioner can demonstrate severe and specific prejudice. Many successful delay lawsuits involve delays of 2-5 years or more.
*   **High Bar:** Without a statutory deadline, the bar for proving ""unreasonable delay"" is high. Courts generally defer to agency expertise in managing its docket.
*   **Fact-Specific:** The outcome will heavily depend on the specific facts presented, particularly the evidence of prejudice to the investor.
*   **Goal of Litigation:** Often, the goal of such a lawsuit is not necessarily to win a final judgment but to prompt USCIS to take action. The mere filing of a lawsuit, or even the threat of one, can sometimes lead to an adjudication.

**Conclusion:**

An immigrant investor facing a 3-4 year delay on an I-526 petition has a plausible, though challenging, basis to sue USCIS for unreasonable delay under the APA and Mandamus Act. The absence of a statutory timetable is a significant hurdle, but the substantial length of the delay, coupled with demonstrable and severe prejudice to the investor, could persuade a court to compel USCIS to adjudicate the petition. Success is not guaranteed and will depend heavily on the specific facts and the investor's ability to articulate compelling reasons for the court's intervention.",[],,0.8361337780952454,13.561649048625796,32.00479915433405
"Can a federal court exercise subject matter jurisdiction to halt the removal of an immigrant with a valid removal order who claims a ""regulatory right"" to remain in the United States while their application for a provisional unlawful presence waiver is pending?","No, federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to interfere with the execution of valid removal orders based on claims that pending provisional unlawful presence waiver applications create a ""regulatory right"" to remain in the United States. This is due to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), which strips federal courts of jurisdiction over ""any cause or claim"" by an alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to execute removal orders, making no exception for challenges to the government's underlying ""authority"" to execute such orders.",,,,,,,,"No, federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to interfere with the execution of valid removal orders based on claims that pending provisional unlawful presence waiver applications create a ""regulatory right"" to remain in the United States.

Here's a breakdown of why:

1.  **Final Order of Removal:** Once a removal order becomes final, it significantly limits judicial intervention. Federal courts, particularly district courts, have very limited subject matter jurisdiction to review or halt such orders. The primary avenue for review of a final order of removal is typically in the U.S. Court of Appeals, and only on specific legal grounds, not discretionary ones.

2.  **Nature of the Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver (I-601A):**
    *   **Not a Stay of Removal:** The I-601A waiver process is designed to allow certain individuals who are *otherwise eligible* for an immigrant visa to apply for a waiver of unlawful presence *before* departing the U.S. for their consular interview abroad. It does *not* confer lawful status, nor does it provide any protection from removal.
    *   **Ineligibility with a Final Order:** Crucially, individuals who have a final order of removal are generally **ineligible** to apply for or benefit from an I-601A waiver. The regulations specifically state that an applicant must not be in removal proceedings and must not have a final order of removal. If an individual with a final order of removal somehow filed an I-601A, it would likely be denied on that basis, or the application itself would be considered improperly filed.
    *   **No ""Regulatory Right"" to Remain:** There is no ""regulatory right"" to remain in the U.S. simply because an I-601A application is pending. The pendency of this application does not automatically stay a valid removal order.

3.  **Statutory Limitations on Judicial Review:**
    *   **INA § 242(a)(2)(C):** This provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) generally precludes judicial review of any final order of removal.
    *   **INA § 242(a)(2)(B):** This provision precludes judicial review of any decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under the INA to be in their discretion (such as the granting of waivers).
    *   **INA § 242(g):** This provision states that no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders, except as provided in INA § 242 itself (which primarily directs review to the Courts of Appeals for specific legal challenges).

**Conclusion:**

Given that the immigrant has a valid final order of removal, and the provisional unlawful presence waiver process is not designed to halt removal or provide a ""right"" to remain, especially for someone with a final order, a federal court would almost certainly lack subject matter jurisdiction to intervene and halt the removal. The claim of a ""regulatory right"" in this context is fundamentally flawed and would not overcome the strong statutory limitations on judicial review in immigration cases.",[],,0.8356250524520874,15.848400000000002,25.96520000000001

Here's a breakdown of why, addressing each of the alien's arguments:

1.  **Immigration Court Lacked Jurisdiction Because the NTA Was Not Filed:**
    *   **Legal Principle:** For an immigration court to have jurisdiction over removal proceedings, a Notice to Appear (NTA) must be filed with the court. While the Supreme Court's decisions in *Pereira v. Sessions* (2018) and *Niz-Chavez v. Garland* (2021) focused on the ""stop-time rule"" and the requirement for an NTA to specify the time and place of the initial hearing, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and most circuit courts have held that jurisdiction vests upon the *filing* of a charging document (NTA) with the immigration court, even if that NTA initially lacks the specific time and date of the hearing.
    *   **Application:** However, the alien's argument here is more fundamental: that the NTA was *not filed* at all. If the NTA was never filed with the immigration court, then the court never acquired jurisdiction over the alien's case *ab initio*. Without jurisdiction, any subsequent order of removal is void. This is a critical procedural defect. The government bears the burden of proving that jurisdiction properly vested. If the record truly lacks evidence of the NTA's filing, this argument is very strong.

2.  **BIA Improperly Relied on a Reconstructed Record (Form I-213 Instead of the NTA) to Prove Notice:**
    *   **Legal Principle:** For an in absentia order to be valid, the government must establish by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the alien was provided *written notice* of the time and place of the hearing and the consequences of failing to appear (INA § 240(b)(5)(A)). While reconstructed records can sometimes be used in immigration proceedings if the original is lost, they must be reliable and not prejudice the alien. A Form I-213 (Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien) is an internal DHS document that records information about an alien's encounter and processing; it is *not* the NTA itself, nor is it typically the official notice of hearing.
    *   **Application:** Relying on an I-213 *instead of* the actual NTA or the specific written notice of hearing to prove that the alien received proper notice is highly problematic. The I-213 might indicate that an NTA was served, but it doesn't necessarily prove the *content* of that NTA (e.g., if it contained the hearing details) or, more importantly, that a *subsequent written notice of the specific hearing* was properly sent to the alien's last known address. The government has a high burden to prove proper notice for an in absentia order, and an I-213 alone is generally insufficient to meet that burden, especially if the original NTA and hearing notices are missing from the record.

3.  **Due Process Rights Violated Due to Lack of Written Notice of the Hearing:**
    *   **Legal Principle:** The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause guarantees aliens a meaningful opportunity to be heard in removal proceedings, which includes adequate notice of the charges and the hearing. As noted above, INA § 240(b)(5)(A) specifically requires *written notice* for an in absentia order.
    *   **Application:** This argument is closely intertwined with the second point. If the BIA relied on an insufficient reconstructed record (like an I-213) and the government failed to produce clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the alien received *written notice of the specific hearing* at which they were ordered removed, then the alien's due process rights were violated. An in absentia order entered without proper notice is fundamentally unfair and violates both statutory requirements and constitutional due process.

**Conclusion:**

The combination of these arguments presents a strong case for reversal.

*   If the NTA was truly **never filed** with the immigration court, the court lacked jurisdiction from the outset, rendering the entire proceeding void.
*   Even if jurisdiction vested, the government bears a heavy burden to prove proper **written notice of the hearing** for an in absentia order. Relying on a Form I-213 *instead of* the actual NTA or the specific hearing notice to prove this is likely insufficient and constitutes a violation of both statutory requirements and due process. The BIA's denial of the motion to reopen under these circumstances would likely be deemed an abuse of discretion or a legal error by a federal appellate court.

Therefore, the federal appellate court should grant the petition to review and reverse the denial of the motion to reopen, allowing the alien an opportunity to present their case.",[],,0.8326534032821655,14.120112313937753,37.70307329724855

Therefore, the petition for review was denied.","It is **unlikely** the immigrant would successfully argue to rescind the *in absentia* removal order and reopen proceedings based on the arguments presented. Here's a breakdown of why:

1.  **Defective NTA Argument (Lacking Date/Time):**
    *   **The Law:** The Supreme Court cases *Pereira v. Sessions* (2018) and *Niz-Chavez v. Garland* (2021) established that an NTA that does not specify the date and time of the initial hearing is ""defective"" for certain statutory purposes, such as triggering the ""stop-time rule"" for cancellation of removal or the 90-day period for voluntary departure.
    *   **Application to *In Absentia* Orders:** However, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and most Circuit Courts have consistently held that such a ""defective"" NTA **does not deprive the immigration court of jurisdiction** over the case. The defect is generally cured when the court subsequently issues a separate ""notice of hearing"" (often Form I-862) that *does* contain the date, time, and place of the hearing. As long as this subsequent notice is properly sent, the court retains jurisdiction.
    *   **Conclusion:** Since the prompt states a ""later hearing notice"" was sent, it's highly probable that this notice contained the missing hearing details. Therefore, the argument that the original NTA was defective for lacking the hearing details, by itself, is unlikely to succeed in rescinding the *in absentia* order, as the court would argue its jurisdiction was established and proper notice of the hearing was attempted.

2.  **Failure to Receive Proper Notice Argument (Typo in Address):**
    *   **The Law:** Under INA § 240(b)(5)(A), an *in absentia* order can be entered if the alien fails to appear after receiving ""written notice required under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a)."" Crucially, INA § 240(b)(5)(B) and 8 CFR § 1003.15(d)(2) place a **statutory duty on the alien to provide the Attorney General with a current address and telephone number** and to notify the court of any change of address. If an alien fails to do so, notice sent to the last address provided by the alien is generally deemed sufficient.
    *   **Application to the Facts:**
        *   The immigrant **signed a form with a mailing address containing a single-letter typo**. This means the incorrect address was provided by the immigrant themselves, not by the government or court.
        *   The hearing notice was sent to this misspelled address and was **returned undeliverable**. This demonstrates that the government *attempted* to provide notice to the address on file.
        *   The burden is on the immigrant to prove they did not receive notice and that their failure to receive it was not due to their own fault.
    *   **Conclusion:** Because the immigrant provided the incorrect address, the court will likely find that the government fulfilled its obligation by sending the notice to the last address on file. The typo, even if accidental, originated with the immigrant, making it difficult to argue that the government failed to provide proper notice. Courts generally hold aliens responsible for ensuring their address on file is accurate.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The immigrant faces significant hurdles. While the original NTA was technically ""defective"" under *Pereira* and *Niz-Chavez*, this defect is usually cured by a subsequent, complete notice of hearing for jurisdictional purposes. More critically, the argument of not receiving proper notice is undermined by the fact that the immigrant themselves provided the misspelled address. The legal system places a strong emphasis on an alien's responsibility to maintain a correct address with the court. Therefore, it is highly probable that the motion to rescind the *in absentia* order and reopen proceedings would be denied.",[],,0.8397692441940308,12.868010065814946,40.6704407020261
"An asylum applicant from Cameroon, whose testimony about persecution (arrest, torture, protest involvement) is deemed credible by an Immigration Judge (I.J.), has their application for asylum and withholding of removal denied due to insufficient corroborating evidence. The I.J. finds that affidavits submitted by family and friends lack personal knowledge of the events and that other forms of corroboration (like medical evidence of injuries) were not provided despite being reasonably available. The applicant argues that the I.J. erred by not following the procedures outlined in *Matter of L-A-C-*, which require an I.J. to first identify specific corroborating evidence, then give the applicant an opportunity to explain its absence, and finally state whether that explanation is sufficient. Did the I.J.'s actions in this case violate the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures?","No, the Immigration Judge's actions did not violate the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures in this case. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the petition for review, affirming the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision, which upheld the I.J.'s denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture (CAT) protection.

The Court held that the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures for identifying specific corroborating evidence and allowing an explanation for its absence apply only when the I.J. requires ""specific corroborating evidence"" and holds one missing piece of evidence to be the *sine qua non* to corroboration.

The I.J. specifically found the affidavits submitted by the applicant's wife, uncle, neighbor, and family lawyer insufficient because the affiants lacked personal knowledge of the recounted events. Other evidence, such as the applicant's injured foot and general country reports or newspaper articles, was deemed insufficient to compel a conclusion contrary to the I.J.'s finding of insufficient corroboration.

Here's why:

1.  **Credibility Finding:** The I.J. found the applicant's testimony about persecution (arrest, torture, protest involvement) to be **credible**. This is the critical trigger for the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures. When an I.J. finds an applicant credible but denies the application due to a lack of corroborating evidence, specific steps must be followed.

2.  **The *Matter of L-A-C-* Procedures:** *L-A-C-* requires an Immigration Judge to:
    *   **First, identify specific corroborating evidence** that is reasonably available to the applicant.
    *   **Second, give the applicant an opportunity to explain its absence.**
    *   **Third, state whether the applicant's explanation for the absence of corroborating evidence is sufficient.**

3.  **Violation in this Case:**
    *   The I.J. did identify a type of specific corroborating evidence that was ""reasonably available"" but ""not provided"" (medical evidence of injuries).
    *   However, the applicant argues that the I.J. **erred by not following the procedures**, specifically implying that the I.J. did *not* give them an opportunity to explain the absence of this evidence, nor did the I.J. then assess the sufficiency of such an explanation. The I.J. simply noted its absence as a reason for denial.

The failure to provide the applicant with an opportunity to explain the absence of reasonably available corroborating evidence (like medical records) after finding their testimony credible is a direct violation of the procedural requirements established in *Matter of L-A-C-*. The issue with the affidavits (lack of personal knowledge) is a separate matter concerning the quality of provided evidence, but it does not negate the I.J.'s obligation to follow *L-A-C-* regarding *missing* reasonably available evidence.",[],,0.8507238030433655,11.650846450369421,34.44342675875362
"Pardeep Kumar, a native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), as well as the denial of his motion to remand.

**Outcome:**

The Fifth Circuit **denied Pardeep Kumar's petition for review.**

**Grounds for Resolution of Various Claims:**

The Fifth Circuit would have reviewed the BIA's decision, which in turn reviewed the Immigration Judge's (IJ) findings. The standards of review are critical here:

1.  **Asylum and Withholding of Removal:**
    *   **Standard of Review:** The Fifth Circuit reviews the BIA's factual findings (e.g., credibility determinations, whether persecution occurred or is likely) under the **substantial evidence** standard. This means the BIA's findings will be upheld unless the evidence ""compels"" a contrary conclusion. Legal questions are reviewed *de novo*.
    *   **Probable Resolution:**
        *   **Asylum:** The Fifth Circuit likely found that the BIA's determination that Kumar failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution was supported by substantial evidence. This often involves upholding the IJ's adverse credibility finding (if made) or finding that the evidence presented did not meet the legal standard for persecution (e.g., the harm was not severe enough, or it was not on account of a protected ground, or the government was unwilling/unable to protect him).
        *   **Withholding of Removal:** This claim has a higher burden of proof than asylum (""clear probability"" or ""more likely than not"" that he would be persecuted). If the asylum claim failed, the withholding claim almost invariably fails for the same reasons, as the evidence would not meet the higher standard. The Fifth Circuit would likely have found that the BIA's denial was also supported by substantial evidence.

2.  **Protection Under the Convention Against Torture (CAT):**
    *   **Standard of Review:** Similar to asylum/withholding, factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence. The petitioner must show it is ""more likely than not"" that he would be tortured by or with the acquiescence of a public official upon return.
    *   **Probable Resolution:** The Fifth Circuit likely found that the BIA's determination that Kumar failed to meet the high burden of proof for CAT protection was supported by substantial evidence. This often means the evidence did not demonstrate that the torture would be inflicted by or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official acting in an official capacity. Private acts of violence, even if severe, typically do not qualify without government involvement.

3.  **Denial of Motion to Remand:**
    *   **Standard of Review:** The denial of a motion to remand is reviewed for **abuse of discretion**. This is a highly deferential standard.
    *   **Probable Resolution:** The Fifth Circuit likely found that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to remand. To succeed on a motion to remand, a petitioner typically needs to present new, material evidence that was unavailable at the prior hearing. The Fifth Circuit would likely have concluded that the evidence presented was either not new, not material, or could have been presented earlier, or that the BIA's reasoning for denying the remand was not arbitrary or capricious.

4.  **Alleged Substantive and Procedural Errors by the BIA and IJ:**
    *   **Standard of Review:** Procedural errors (due process claims) are reviewed *de novo*. Substantive legal errors are also reviewed *de novo*.
    *   **Probable Resolution:**
        *   **Procedural Errors:** The Fifth Circuit likely found that Kumar failed to demonstrate any due process violations that prejudiced his case. Courts generally require a showing that the alleged error actually prevented the petitioner from presenting his case or affected the outcome.
        *   **Substantive Errors:** The Fifth Circuit likely found that the BIA and IJ applied the correct legal standards and that their interpretations of the law were sound, or that any minor errors were harmless and did not affect the outcome.

In summary, the Fifth Circuit would have likely concluded that the BIA's decision was legally sound and supported by the administrative record, thus denying Pardeep Kumar's petition for review across all claims.",[],,0.8355476260185242,13.810501805243057,36.522352048558446
"An individual from El Salvador, previously ordered removed and later unlawfully re-entered, sought deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) claiming the Salvadoran government would torture him as a suspected gang member due to his tattoos, criminal record, and evidence of police searching for him. His petition for review of the denial of CAT relief was filed with the Court of Appeals, but he was subsequently removed to El Salvador while the appeal was pending. He also provided affidavits detailing a 2023 incident where police searched for him at his father's home. The immigration judge (IJ) denied relief, noting an adverse credibility determination and stating general country conditions were insufficient, but did not mention the affidavits in the likelihood-of-torture assessment. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) adopted the IJ's decision.

The petition for review is granted, and the case is remanded for further consideration of the CAT deferral claim consistent with the opinion.","This scenario presents two distinct legal questions: mootness due to removal and potential agency error in denying CAT deferral.

### 1. Does the individual's removal moot his appeal?

**Yes, the individual's removal to El Salvador while his appeal was pending almost certainly moots his petition for review of the denial of CAT relief.**

*   **General Rule:** A case becomes moot when the court can no longer provide effective relief. For a petition for review challenging a denial of deferral of removal, the primary relief sought is to prevent the individual's removal. Once the individual has been removed, that specific relief is no longer available.
*   **Jurisdictional Impact:** Federal courts generally lose jurisdiction over a petition for review once the petitioner has been removed from the United States, especially when the relief sought is solely related to preventing that removal. The court cannot order the U.S. government to bring the individual back to the U.S. to grant deferral of removal.
*   **Limited Exceptions:** While some circuits have recognized very narrow exceptions to mootness in immigration cases (e.g., where the order has significant collateral legal consequences that could still be remedied, or where the petitioner could potentially return to the U.S. and face the same order), these exceptions rarely apply to a direct appeal of a CAT deferral denial where the individual has already been removed. The relief of ""deferral of removal"" is inherently tied to the individual being present in the U.S.

Therefore, the Court of Appeals would likely dismiss the petition for review as moot.

### 2. Did the agency err in denying CAT deferral?

**Yes, the agency likely erred in denying CAT deferral by failing to address all relevant evidence, specifically the 2023 affidavits detailing police searches.**

*   **CAT Standard:** To qualify for deferral of removal under CAT, an applicant must demonstrate that it is ""more likely than not"" (i.e., a greater than 50% chance) that they would be tortured by or with the acquiescence of a public official upon return to their home country.
*   **Agency's Duty to Consider All Evidence:** Immigration judges and the BIA are required to consider all relevant evidence presented by an applicant in assessing their claim. Failure to do so can constitute an error of law or an abuse of discretion.
*   **The Error:** The IJ's decision, adopted by the BIA, noted an adverse credibility determination and found general country conditions insufficient. However, the IJ ""did not mention the affidavits in the likelihood-of-torture assessment.""
    *   **Significance of the Affidavits:** The affidavits detailing a 2023 incident where police searched for him at his father's home are crucial. This is not ""general country conditions"" evidence; it is *specific, individualized evidence* of the Salvadoran government actively targeting this particular individual. This type of evidence directly supports the ""likelihood"" component of a CAT claim, suggesting a personalized risk beyond what general country reports might convey.
    *   **Impact of Adverse Credibility:** While an adverse credibility finding significantly weakens an applicant's case, it does not relieve the agency of its duty to consider *other, independent evidence*. The affidavits, if from third parties or otherwise independently verifiable, could corroborate the applicant's fear even if his own testimony was deemed not credible on other points. The IJ needed to assess the weight and credibility of the affidavits themselves and explain why they did or did not contribute to the likelihood assessment.
    *   **Failure to Articulate Reasoning:** By failing to mention or analyze this specific, individualized evidence in the context of the likelihood-of-torture assessment, the IJ (and by adoption, the BIA) failed to provide a reasoned decision demonstrating that all relevant evidence was considered. This omission suggests that the agency did not fully evaluate the totality of the evidence regarding the individualized risk of torture.

**Conclusion on Agency Error:** While the adverse credibility finding makes the CAT claim more challenging, the agency's failure to explicitly address and weigh the specific, individualized evidence of police targeting (the 2023 affidavits) in its likelihood-of-torture assessment constitutes a likely error. A reviewing court would typically remand such a case for the agency to properly consider and articulate its reasoning regarding all relevant evidence.

**Overall:** While the agency likely erred in its denial of CAT relief, the individual's subsequent removal means that the Court of Appeals would almost certainly find his appeal moot, preventing the court from reaching the merits of the agency's error.",[],,0.8245023488998413,14.7397009530069,26.894372329937568
"An individual holding an H-4 visa and employment authorization has applied for renewal, but after more than seven months, the applications remain unprocessed. Her employment authorization expired three months ago, leading to her inability to work, loss of her driver's license, and significant financial hardship for her family. She seeks a preliminary injunction to compel the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to process her applications within seven days, alleging unreasonable delay. USCIS, however, asserts that it processes applications on a first-in, first-out basis, and granting the injunction would advance her application over others waiting their turn. Under these circumstances, should a court grant the preliminary injunction?","No, the court should deny the motion for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiff failed to demonstrate a clear likelihood of success on the merits of her unreasonable delay claim because she did not sufficiently rebut the agency's assertion that it processes applications on a first-in, first-out basis (TRAC Factor 1). Granting the injunction would impermissibly advance her application over others waiting their turn, thereby harming competing priorities (TRAC Factor 4). Furthermore, the public interest weighed against granting the injunction, as jumping one applicant ahead of others in an agency's queue does not serve the public interest. Although the plaintiff did show irreparable harm through the unrecoverable loss of income, this was insufficient to meet her burden given the other factors.",,,,,,,,"No, the court should deny the motion for a preliminary injunction.

Furthermore, the public interest weighed against granting the injunction, as jumping one applicant ahead of others in an agency's queue does not serve the public interest. Although the plaintiff did show irreparable harm through the unrecoverable loss of income, this was insufficient to meet her burden given the other factors.","A court would likely **not grant** the preliminary injunction compelling USCIS to process the applications within seven days, although it might consider other forms of relief or a less aggressive timeline.

Here's an analysis based on the four factors for granting a preliminary injunction:

1.  **Likelihood of Success on the Merits (Unreasonable Delay):**
    *   **Plaintiff's Argument:** The plaintiff would argue that a 7-month delay (and 3 months post-expiration) for a renewal, especially one causing severe hardship, constitutes ""unreasonable delay"" under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). Courts often look at factors like the time elapsed, the agency's explanation, the complexity of the task, and the impact of the delay. H-4 EAD renewals are generally considered routine.
    *   **USCIS's Argument:** USCIS would counter that its ""first-in, first-out"" policy is a reasonable administrative approach, and that high volume and resource constraints are legitimate reasons for processing times. They would argue that the delay, while unfortunate, is not *unreasonable* in the context of their overall workload.
    *   **Assessment:** While 7 months is a significant delay, especially with the hardship, proving ""unreasonable delay"" in a way that compels a specific, rapid action like 7 days is challenging. Courts are generally deferential to agency processing methods unless the delay is egregious or violates a statutory deadline (which doesn't exist here for H-4 EAD processing). The plaintiff has a *plausible* argument for unreasonable delay, but success on the merits for a *7-day mandate* is less likely.

2.  **Irreparable Harm:**
    *   **Plaintiff's Argument:** The plaintiff clearly demonstrates irreparable harm: loss of income, inability to work, loss of driver's license, and significant financial hardship for her family. These are concrete harms that cannot be fully remedied by money damages later, as the family's stability is immediately threatened.
    *   **Assessment:** This factor weighs strongly in favor of the plaintiff. The harm described is severe and ongoing.

3.  **Balance of Equities/Hardships:**
    *   **Plaintiff's Hardship:** As noted, the plaintiff faces severe personal and financial hardship.
    *   **USCIS's Hardship:** USCIS would argue that granting an injunction would force them to deviate from their established ""first-in, first-out"" processing system, potentially disrupting their operations and creating a precedent where other applicants could seek similar injunctions, leading to a ""rush to the courthouse"" and further chaos in processing. It would also be seen as unfair to other applicants who are waiting patiently.
    *   **Assessment:** This is a critical balancing act. While the plaintiff's individual hardship is high, the court must also consider the systemic impact on USCIS and other applicants. Courts are generally reluctant to micromanage agency operations or create a system where those who sue get preferential treatment over others in line. The ""7-day"" demand is particularly burdensome on the agency.

4.  **Public Interest:**
    *   **Plaintiff's Argument:** The public has an interest in ensuring government agencies act reasonably and efficiently, and in preventing severe individual hardship.
    *   **USCIS's Argument:** The public also has an interest in orderly and fair immigration processing, maintaining the integrity of the ""first-in, first-out"" system, and preventing judicial overreach into administrative functions.
    *   **Assessment:** This factor is mixed. While preventing hardship is in the public interest, so is maintaining a fair and predictable system for all applicants.

**Conclusion:**

Given these factors, a court would likely **decline to grant a preliminary injunction compelling USCIS to process the applications within seven days.**

*   The **irreparable harm** factor strongly favors the plaintiff.
*   However, the **likelihood of success on the merits** for such an aggressive timeline is questionable, as courts are generally deferential to agency processing times unless they are truly egregious or violate a specific mandate.
*   Most importantly, the **balance of equities** and **public interest** would likely tip against the plaintiff for a *7-day mandate*. Granting such an injunction would significantly disrupt USCIS's operations, create unfairness to other applicants, and set a problematic precedent. Courts are very hesitant to order government agencies to jump specific individuals to the front of the line, especially with such a tight deadline.

**Possible Alternatives a Court Might Consider (but not necessarily a preliminary injunction):**

*   A court might find the delay unreasonable and order USCIS to process the application within a *more reasonable* timeframe (e.g., 30, 60, or 90 days), rather than 7 days, perhaps through a writ of mandamus if the plaintiff can meet the higher standard for that.
*   The court might encourage USCIS to review its internal policies for hardship cases or to expedite processing for individuals facing severe, documented hardship, without issuing a formal injunction.
*   The court might deny the preliminary injunction but allow the case to proceed on the merits, which could eventually lead to an order for processing, but not necessarily within 7 days.",[],,0.8192763328552246,14.613498779801017,29.017511169513824
"A non-profit organization, ""Immigrant Rights Advocates,"" provides pro bono legal services to low-income immigrants. The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) recently finalized a rule significantly increasing fees for various immigration filings, including appeals to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and applications for cancellation of removal. Immigrant Rights Advocates argues that these increased fees will severely limit their ability to provide legal representation, forcing them to take on fewer clients and divert resources to fee waiver applications. They believe EOIR failed to adequately consider these impacts during the rulemaking process. Can Immigrant Rights Advocates successfully challenge the legality of these fee increases, particularly for appeals and cancellation of removal applications, under the Administrative Procedure Act?","Yes, Immigrant Rights Advocates can likely successfully challenge the legality of these specific fee increases under the Administrative Procedure Act.

However, success is not guaranteed and would depend on several factors.

Here's a breakdown of the potential arguments and challenges:

**I. Standing to Sue**

Immigrant Rights Advocates would likely have standing to challenge the rule:

1.  **Organizational Standing:** The organization itself is directly harmed. The increased fees force them to divert resources (to fee waiver applications), take on fewer clients, and thus impair their ability to fulfill their mission of providing legal services to low-income immigrants. This constitutes a concrete and particularized injury.
2.  **Associational Standing:** They could also argue associational standing on behalf of their members/clients (low-income immigrants) who are directly harmed by the increased fees, as the organization's mission is to protect those interests.

**II. Grounds for Challenge Under the APA**

The most likely and strongest ground for challenge would be that the rule is **""arbitrary and capricious""** under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). This standard requires a court to determine whether the agency:

*   Relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider.
*   Entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem.
*   Offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency.
*   Is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.

Immigrant Rights Advocates' argument directly targets the second point: **EOIR ""failed to adequately consider an important aspect of the problem"" – specifically, the impact of increased fees on access to justice for low-income immigrants and the organizations that serve them.**

**Specific Arguments Immigrant Rights Advocates Would Make:**

1.  **Failure to Consider Access to Justice:** When setting fees for critical legal processes like appeals to the BIA (which can prevent deportation) and applications for cancellation of removal, agencies have a responsibility to consider the impact on individuals' ability to access those processes, especially when fundamental rights (like the right to remain in the country, due process) are at stake. EOIR's alleged failure to adequately analyze how these fees would create a barrier to legal representation and access to remedies could be deemed arbitrary and capricious.
2.  **Inadequate Response to Public Comments:** If Immigrant Rights Advocates or similar organizations submitted detailed comments during the notice-and-comment period outlining these specific concerns (impact on pro bono services, access to justice, diversion of resources), and EOIR failed to meaningfully address those concerns in the final rule's preamble, this could be a strong point of challenge. Agencies must provide a reasoned response to significant comments.
3.  **Lack of Rational Basis for Fee Levels:** While agencies have discretion in setting fees, if the fees are so high that they effectively price out a significant portion of the population from accessing legal remedies, the agency's justification for those specific fee levels might be deemed irrational or unsupported by the record.
4.  **Impact on Pro Bono Services:** The argument that the fees force pro bono organizations to divert resources to fee waiver applications (which themselves can be burdensome) highlights a systemic impact that EOIR should have considered. This isn't just about individual applicants but the entire ecosystem of legal aid.

**III. Potential Challenges for Immigrant Rights Advocates (EOIR's Defenses)**

1.  **Agency Deference:** Courts generally grant significant deference to agency expertise, especially in matters of cost recovery and administrative efficiency. EOIR would argue that the fees are necessary to cover the costs of processing applications and appeals, manage caseloads, and ensure the efficient operation of the immigration court system.
2.  **Existence of Fee Waivers:** EOIR would likely argue that the existence of fee waivers adequately addresses concerns about low-income individuals. They would contend that they *did* consider the impact on low-income individuals by providing a mechanism for those who cannot afford the fees.
3.  **Burden of Proof:** Immigrant Rights Advocates would bear the burden of demonstrating that EOIR's decision was arbitrary and capricious, not merely that they disagree with the policy. They would need to show that EOIR's consideration of the impacts was *so inadequate* as to be unreasonable.
4.  **Scope of Agency's Mandate:** EOIR might argue that while access to justice is important, their primary mandate is to administer immigration law efficiently, and setting fees to recover costs is a legitimate exercise of that mandate.

**Conclusion:**

Immigrant Rights Advocates has a plausible, though challenging, case. Their strongest argument lies in demonstrating that EOIR **failed to adequately consider the critical impact of these increased fees on access to justice for low-income immigrants and the ability of pro bono organizations to provide essential legal services.** If they can present compelling evidence that EOIR either ignored significant public comments on this issue or provided a perfunctory and unreasoned explanation for dismissing these concerns, they could persuade a court that the rule is arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The existence and efficacy of fee waivers would be a key battleground in this litigation.",[],,0.8256576657295227,15.708024204897274,26.238228257810306
"An individual who has been a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for over five years, but whose initial admission to the U.S. as an ""accompanying"" relative was procedurally flawed because they arrived before the principal immigrant, applies for naturalization. Can this individual be denied naturalization on the grounds that they were not ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence,"" even if the government's window for rescinding their LPR status has closed and there was no fraud or misrepresentation on the applicant's part?","Yes, the individual can be denied naturalization. An applicant for naturalization must establish that they have been ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence."" ""Lawfully admitted"" requires compliance with substantive legal requirements, not just procedural regularity. Therefore, an alien who obtains LPR status due to a government mistake, even without fraud, is not lawfully admitted if they were not substantively entitled to that status. In this situation, entering the U.S. before the principal immigrant violates the ""accompanying"" relative requirement of 22 C.F.R. § 40.1(a)(2), which is consistent with the plain language of 8 U.S.C. § 1153(d). The fact that the five-year statute of limitations for rescinding LPR status has run does not mean the initial entry was lawful or that the individual is eligible for naturalization; it only prevents the government from instituting rescission proceedings. Federal courts also lack the equitable power to grant naturalization outside of the means specified in the Immigration and Nationality Act.",,,,,,,,"Yes, the individual can be denied naturalization. An applicant for naturalization must establish that they have been ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence."" ""Lawfully admitted"" requires compliance with substantive legal requirements, not just procedural regularity. Therefore, an alien who obtains LPR status due to a government mistake, even without fraud, is not lawfully admitted if they were not substantively entitled to that status. In this situation, entering the U.S. before the principal immigrant violates the ""accompanying"" relative requirement of 22 C.F.R. § 40.1(a)(2), which is consistent with the plain language of 8 U.S.C. § 1153(d).

Here's a breakdown of the legal reasoning:

1.  **""Lawfully Admitted for Permanent Residence"" Requirement:**
    *   Section 316(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) requires an applicant for naturalization to have been ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence.""
    *   The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and federal courts have interpreted ""lawfully admitted"" to mean more than just having a green card or having gone through the procedural steps of admission. It requires that the individual's admission was in **substantive compliance** with the immigration laws at the time of admission. If the initial grant of LPR status was based on a fundamental error of law, it is considered to have been ""unlawfully"" granted, even if the applicant was unaware of the error and did not commit fraud.

2.  **The ""Accompanying Relative"" Flaw:**
    *   An ""accompanying relative"" derives their eligibility from a principal immigrant. A fundamental requirement for an accompanying relative is that they must accompany or follow to join the principal immigrant. Arriving *before* the principal immigrant is a substantive legal flaw that means the individual did not meet the statutory definition of an ""accompanying relative"" at the time of their admission. This makes their initial grant of LPR status procedurally flawed and, more importantly, substantively unlawful.

3.  **Irrelevance of the Rescission Bar (INA 246):**
    *   INA Section 246 allows the government to rescind LPR status if it was ""improperly or illegally granted"" within five years of the grant. After five years, the government is generally barred from initiating administrative rescission proceedings.
    *   However, the inability to rescind LPR status under INA 246 does **not** automatically validate the lawfulness of the original admission for naturalization purposes. The BIA, in *Matter of K.*, 20 I&N Dec. 418 (BIA 1991), explicitly held that the five-year bar on rescission does not prevent the government from determining, in a naturalization proceeding, that the applicant was not ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence."" The two inquiries are distinct.

4.  **No Fraud/Misrepresentation:**
    *   While the absence of fraud or misrepresentation means the government cannot pursue judicial denaturalization under INA 340(a) (which requires fraud), it does not cure the underlying substantive unlawfulness of the initial admission for the purpose of meeting the naturalization requirements. The applicant's good faith or lack of knowledge about the procedural flaw does not change the fact that their admission was not in substantive compliance with the law.

**Conclusion:**

Therefore, even though the individual has held LPR status for over five years and was not fraudulent, USCIS can deny their naturalization application. The ""accompanying relative"" arriving before the principal is a substantive legal defect that means the initial admission was not ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence."" While the individual remains an LPR (because the government cannot administratively rescind their status), they do not meet the higher bar for naturalization.",[],,0.8455443382263184,15.62624977227182,23.428986609582807
"In a case where a juvenile court issues an emergency custody order with special findings for a minor seeking Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, and then, without notice or hearing, vacates that order and issues a new one without the special findings, has the court violated procedural due process and abused its discretion?","Yes, the trial court violated procedural due process by vacating its prior orders without a hearing and notice, in violation of Juv.R. 14(C). Given that the trial court's decision denied the minor eligibility for a legal immigration status, it violated the procedural due process rights of the parties. Furthermore, the appellate court found no factual or legal basis for the trial court's decision to vacate the special findings, concluding that it was a clear abuse of discretion.

Here's a breakdown of why:

1.  **Violation of Procedural Due Process:**
    *   **What is Procedural Due Process?** It requires that individuals be given notice and an opportunity to be heard before the government (including a court) deprives them of a significant life, liberty, or property interest.
    *   **Application to the Scenario:**
        *   **Significant Interest:** The minor's ability to pursue Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) is a significant interest, as it provides a pathway to legal status and protection from deportation. The ""special findings"" from the juvenile court are a *prerequisite* for SIJS.
        *   **Deprivation:** Vacating the order *with* special findings and issuing a new one *without* them directly deprives the minor of the judicial findings essential for their SIJS petition.
        *   **Lack of Notice and Hearing:** The critical element here is that this was done ""without notice or hearing."" This means the minor, their attorney, or guardian ad litem (GAL) was not informed of the court's intent to change the order and was not given an opportunity to present arguments, evidence, or object to the change. This is a fundamental denial of due process.
        *   **Emergency Orders vs. Substantive Changes:** While emergency orders can sometimes be issued *ex parte* (without prior notice) in truly urgent situations, vacating a substantive order that confers rights and issuing a new one without those rights, especially without notice or a hearing, is generally impermissible. Any subsequent modification of such an order typically requires proper notice and an opportunity to be heard.

2.  **Abuse of Discretion:**
    *   **What is Abuse of Discretion?** A court abuses its discretion when its decision is arbitrary, capricious, without a factual basis, or contrary to law.
    *   **Application to the Scenario:**
        *   **Contrary to Law:** Violating procedural due process is, by definition, acting contrary to established legal principles, which constitutes an abuse of discretion.
        *   **Arbitrary/Capricious:** Vacating an order that contained specific, legally required findings (for SIJS) and then reissuing it without those findings, especially without any stated reason, new evidence, or a hearing, appears arbitrary and capricious. If the initial findings were properly made based on the evidence, removing them without a new factual basis or legal error is an abuse.
        *   **Harm to the Minor's Best Interest:** Juvenile courts are generally guided by the ""best interest of the child."" Removing the SIJS findings without process directly harms the minor's ability to seek a critical form of relief and protection, which is often contrary to their best interest. The court's role in SIJS cases is to make factual findings if the evidence supports them, not to obstruct the process.

**In summary:** The court's actions of vacating an order with SIJS special findings and issuing a new one without them, all done without notice or a hearing, almost certainly constitutes a violation of the minor's procedural due process rights and an abuse of the court's discretion. The minor's legal representative would likely have strong grounds to file a motion for reconsideration, a motion to vacate the second order, or an appeal.",[],,0.8082029819488525,14.340957880434782,31.89412364130436

Here's why:

1.  **Purpose of 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H):** This waiver is specifically designed for aliens who were *inadmissible at the time of entry or adjustment of status* due to fraud or misrepresentation (under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i)). It allows them to overcome that specific ground of inadmissibility, which then becomes a ground of removability under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(A) (alien inadmissible at time of entry or adjustment of status). The text of (a)(1)(H) explicitly states it applies to ""any alien who is deportable under paragraph (1)(A) because of a visa, entry document, or misrepresentation of material fact.""

2.  **Nature of the Removability Ground (8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(3)(B)(iii)):** The alien in the question is charged with removability due to a *criminal conviction* for an aggravated felony (visa fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1546(a)). This falls under the ""Security and Related Grounds"" for removability, specifically for aggravated felonies.

3.  **Statutory Limitation:** The waiver under § 1227(a)(1)(H) is limited to grounds of removability under *paragraph (1)(A)* or *subparagraph (A)(i) of paragraph (1)*. It does *not* extend to criminal grounds of removability found in paragraph (2) (criminal offenses) or paragraph (3) (security and related grounds, which includes aggravated felonies).

Even though the underlying act is ""visa fraud,"" the *ground of removability* is the criminal conviction for an aggravated felony, not the act of fraud itself as an inadmissibility ground. Therefore, the specific waiver for fraud/misrepresentation in obtaining a visa/entry does not apply to a removability charge based on a criminal conviction for that fraud.",[],,0.8711407780647278,13.107203007518798,32.67551629072682

Garland* if they received, or do not dispute receiving, a subsequent Notice of Hearing, even if the initial Notice to Appear did not contain the date and time of their removal proceedings.

Garland*** (2023), the answer is **no**, the initial defect in the Notice to Appear (NTA) would **not** invalidate the removal proceedings, and the alien would **not** be entitled to a remand based on that case.

Here's why:

1.  **Rodriguez v. Garland's Holding:** The Supreme Court in *Rodriguez v. Garland* explicitly held that an NTA that omits the date and time of an alien's initial removal hearing does **not** deprive an immigration court of jurisdiction over the removal proceedings, provided the alien subsequently receives a Notice of Hearing (NOH) that *does* contain the necessary date and time information.

2.  **Distinction from Pereira and Niz-Chavez:** The Court clarified that its prior decisions in *Pereira v. Sessions* (2018) and *Niz-Chavez v. Garland* (2021) were specifically about the ""stop-time rule"" for cancellation of removal, not the fundamental jurisdiction of the immigration court to hear a removal case. Those cases held that an NTA lacking date/time information does not trigger the stop-time rule, meaning the alien's period of continuous physical presence continues to accrue. They did not, however, rule that such an NTA prevents the immigration court from ever gaining jurisdiction.

3.  **Jurisdiction of the Immigration Court:** The Court in *Rodriguez* reaffirmed that an immigration court's jurisdiction over removal proceedings is established when the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) files the NTA (the charging document) with the court. The subsequent NOH, which provides the missing date and time, ensures that the alien receives proper notice of their hearing, satisfying due process requirements and allowing the proceedings to move forward.

**Conclusion:**

Since the alien in your scenario subsequently received a Notice of Hearing (NOH) that presumably contained the date and time of their removal proceedings, the initial defect in the NTA (lacking date/time) would be cured for jurisdictional purposes. The immigration court would have jurisdiction, and the alien would not be entitled to a remand based on *Rodriguez v. Garland* on the grounds of a defective NTA.",[],,0.850529670715332,13.264545454545459,39.14681818181819
"A public interest organization submits a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to a federal agency, seeking all complaint records filed against its administrative judges.

The organization challenges both categories of redactions in court. How should a court rule on these challenges based on the provided case?","Based on the case ruling, the court should rule as follows:
1.  **Redaction of judges' names under Exemption 6:** The agency's categorical, across-the-board redaction of all administrative judges' names would likely be deemed inadequately justified. FOIA Exemption 6 does not categorically exempt individuals' identities, as the privacy and public interests at stake can vary depending on factors such as whether the judge is sitting or retired, the seriousness and number of complaints, and the potential for public understanding of government operations through disclosure. A more individualized inquiry, or a particularized showing for defined subgroups of judges, is required to properly balance the privacy interests against the public interest in disclosure.
2.  **Redaction of non-responsive information within responsive records:** The court should find no statutory basis for redacting ostensibly non-responsive information from a record once that record has been deemed responsive to a FOIA request. Under the statutory framework, once an agency identifies a record as responsive, the sole basis for withholding information within that record is if the information falls within one of FOIA's nine statutory exemptions. Redacting non-exempt information on the basis of non-responsiveness within an otherwise responsive record is not permitted by the statute.",,,,,,,,"Based on the case ruling, the court should rule as follows:

**1. Redaction of Administrative Judges' Names (Exemption 6 - Privacy Interest):**

*   **Court Ruling:** The court should **reject** the agency's blanket assertion of a privacy interest under FOIA Exemption 6 and order the disclosure of the administrative judges' names.

*   **Reasoning:**
    *   **FOIA Exemption 6** protects ""personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy."" To invoke Exemption 6, an agency must demonstrate a substantial privacy interest and then show that this interest outweighs the public interest in disclosure, such that the invasion of privacy would be ""clearly unwarranted.""
    *   **Privacy Interest:** While federal employees generally have some privacy interest in their personnel information, this interest is significantly diminished when the information relates to their official conduct, especially for public officials like administrative judges who exercise significant governmental authority. Complaints filed against them regarding their professional duties are inherently matters of public concern. A ""blanket"" assertion of privacy for all judges' names, without specific justification for each, is generally disfavored under FOIA.
    *   **Public Interest:** There is a strong public interest in government transparency and accountability, particularly concerning the conduct of officials who adjudicate disputes and make decisions affecting the public. Knowing the names of administrative judges against whom complaints have been filed allows the public to assess the integrity, fairness, and performance of the administrative justice system. This public interest in oversight and understanding the functioning of government generally outweighs the minimal privacy interest of public officials in their names when those names are linked to their official conduct.
    *   **""Clearly Unwarranted"":** Given the strong public interest and the diminished privacy interest for public officials in this context, it is highly unlikely that disclosing the names would constitute a ""clearly unwarranted"" invasion of privacy. The agency would bear a heavy burden to demonstrate specific harm, which a blanket assertion fails to do.

**2. Redaction of ""Non-Responsive"" Information within Responsive Records:**

*   **Court Ruling:** The court should **reject** the agency's assertion that it can redact discrete sentences or paragraphs within otherwise responsive complaint records simply because it deems them ""non-responsive,"" even if they do not fall under a FOIA exemption. The court should order the disclosure of this information.

*   **Reasoning:**
    *   **Core FOIA Principle:** FOIA mandates that agencies disclose all agency records unless they fall squarely within one of the nine specific statutory exemptions. There is no ""non-responsive information"" exemption.
    *   **""Responsive Record"" vs. ""Responsive Information"":** Once a document is determined to be a ""responsive record"" (i.e., it falls within the scope of the request), the agency's duty is to release that record in its entirety, *unless* specific portions are covered by a valid FOIA exemption. The concept of ""non-responsive"" applies to *records* themselves, not to *portions* of otherwise responsive records.
    *   **Segregability:** FOIA requires agencies to release ""any reasonably segregable portion of a record"" after redacting exempt material. This principle means that if a portion of a responsive record is *not* exempt, it must be disclosed. Allowing agencies to redact non-exempt material simply because they deem it ""non-responsive"" would create a de facto tenth exemption, undermining the statutory scheme and the public's right to access government information. It would permit agencies to unilaterally determine what information within a responsive document is ""relevant"" to the requester, which is not their role under FOIA.

In summary, the court should rule in favor of the public interest organization on both challenges, ordering the disclosure of the administrative judges' names and the ""non-responsive"" portions of the complaint records.",[],,0.8511037230491638,16.222395911413972,20.576564906303247
"A U.S. company, ""InnovateTech Inc."", seeks to extend an H-1B visa for its foreign citizen employee, who works as a ""Lead Software Architect"" at a client site through a subcontracting arrangement.

Here's a breakdown of the potential challenges under the APA's ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)):

1.  **USCIS's Failure to Address the DOL Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH) Argument:**
    *   **APA Violation:** This is the most significant point for InnovateTech. An agency acts arbitrarily and capriciously if it ""entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem"" or ""offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency."" USCIS is required to provide a reasoned explanation for its decision, which includes addressing material arguments and evidence submitted by the petitioner.
    *   **Strength of Challenge:** InnovateTech referenced the OOH to argue that a ""Lead Software Architect"" position typically requires a bachelor's degree in a specific specialty, which directly relates to the ""specialty occupation"" requirement for an H-1B visa. If USCIS completely ignored this argument without explanation, a court could find that the agency failed to engage in reasoned decision-making. This could lead to a **remand** of the case back to USCIS for reconsideration, requiring the agency to address the OOH argument.

2.  **Lack of Sufficiently Detailed Work Assignments:**
    *   **USCIS's Stance:** USCIS often requires detailed, non-speculative work assignments for the entire visa period, especially for third-party placements, to ensure the ""specialty occupation"" criteria are met throughout.
    *   **InnovateTech's Challenge:** InnovateTech would need to argue that the documentation *did* provide sufficient detail, and USCIS's finding was unreasonable or based on a misinterpretation of the evidence. However, courts generally grant USCIS significant deference in evaluating the sufficiency of evidence. If the assignments were genuinely vague, USCIS's denial on this point might be upheld.

3.  **Perceived Inconsistencies in Minimum Degree Requirements:**
    *   **USCIS's Stance:** Inconsistencies in stated requirements can undermine the credibility of the petition and raise doubts about whether the position consistently meets the ""specialty occupation"" definition.
    *   **InnovateTech's Challenge:** InnovateTech would need to demonstrate that the inconsistencies were minor, easily reconcilable, or that USCIS misinterpreted them. If the inconsistencies are material and genuine, USCIS's reliance on them to deny the petition is likely *not* arbitrary or capricious, as it reflects a reasonable concern about the petition's accuracy and the true nature of the position.

4.  **Insufficient Evidence of ""Actual Control"" (Employer-Employee Relationship):**
    *   **USCIS's Stance:** For third-party placements, USCIS scrutinizes whether the petitioner (InnovateTech) has ""actual control"" over the employee's day-to-day tasks, not just administrative control (hire, pay, fire). This is a common point of contention and a frequent reason for denial. USCIS often looks for evidence like InnovateTech's managers directing the work, InnovateTech's proprietary tools/methodologies being used, or InnovateTech conducting performance reviews related to specific tasks.
    *   **InnovateTech's Challenge:** InnovateTech's documentation of its exclusive right to hire, pay, fire, and supervise is a good start, but USCIS often demands more to prove *operational* control at a client site. InnovateTech would need to argue that its submitted evidence, taken as a whole, *did* adequately demonstrate actual control, and USCIS's conclusion was an unreasonable interpretation of that evidence or an overly strict application of its policy. While challenging, this is a frequently litigated area, and courts sometimes find USCIS's interpretations of ""control"" to be arbitrary if they ignore substantial evidence provided by the petitioner.

**Conclusion:**

While challenging USCIS denials under the APA is generally difficult due to the high degree of deference courts give to agency decisions, InnovateTech has a **strong argument regarding USCIS's failure to address the Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH) reference.** This omission could be deemed an arbitrary and capricious action because USCIS failed to consider a material argument presented by the petitioner.

The other denial reasons (work assignments, inconsistencies, and actual control) are more fact-specific and often fall within USCIS's discretionary authority. InnovateTech would face a higher hurdle to prove that USCIS's findings on these points were unreasonable or unsupported by the record.

Therefore, InnovateTech's most promising path to successfully challenging this denial under the APA would be to focus on USCIS's procedural flaw in failing to address the OOH argument, which could lead to a **remand** for reconsideration rather than an outright reversal of the denial.",[],,0.8355632424354553,17.694386807556842,13.98378108656209
"An individual challenges an immigration judge's in absentia removal order, arguing the NTA was defective because it omitted the date and time of proceedings.

The court distinguishes such a case from situations where no subsequent NOH was received, concluding that the petition for review challenging the removal order should be denied.","No, the individual's admission of receiving a subsequent Notice of Hearing (NOH) significantly weakens, and in most cases, eliminates their ability to successfully challenge the *in absentia* removal order based on a defective Notice to Appear (NTA) that omitted the date and time of proceedings.

Here's why:

1.  **Jurisdiction vs. Notice for In Absentia Orders:** While the Supreme Court cases of *Pereira v. Sessions* (2018) and *Niz-Chavez v. Garland* (2021) established that an NTA missing the date and time is not a ""notice to appear"" for purposes of the stop-time rule for cancellation of removal, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and most circuit courts have distinguished this from the requirements for establishing jurisdiction and issuing *in absentia* orders.

2.  **BIA Precedent (Matter of Mendoza-Hernandez & Matter of Maldonado-Zapata):** In *Matter of Mendoza-Hernandez* and *Matter of Maldonado-Zapata* (2021), the BIA clarified that:
    *   The filing of an NTA (even one missing the date and time) with the Immigration Court vests the Immigration Judge with jurisdiction over the removal proceedings.
    *   For an *in absentia* order to be valid, the critical requirement is that the noncitizen received proper notice of the *specific hearing* they failed to attend.

3.  **Curing the Defect:** A subsequent Notice of Hearing (NOH) that provides the specific date, time, and location of the hearing cures any defect in the original NTA regarding the missing date and time. If the individual received this NOH, they had actual notice of the hearing.

4.  **Application to the Scenario:** Since the individual admits to having received a subsequent NOH, they cannot credibly argue that they lacked notice of the hearing. The NOH provided the essential information (date, time, place) that was missing from the initial NTA. Therefore, the *in absentia* order would likely be upheld, as the individual had proper notice of the hearing and failed to appear.

**Conclusion:** The receipt of a subsequent, properly served NOH effectively negates the argument that the *in absentia* order is invalid due to a defective NTA lacking the date and time. The individual had the required notice for the hearing they missed.",[],,0.8358173370361328,14.508250517598345,34.93728260869568
"An individual, native and citizen of Mexico, is ordered removed from the U.S. after being convicted in Texas of aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon.

Based on U.S. federal court precedent, should the petition for review challenging the removability finding and the denial of continuance be granted?","No, the petition for review should be denied. Aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon under Texas law is considered a crime of violence and, therefore, an aggravated felony for purposes of federal immigration law because it requires the intentional or knowing use or attempted use of physical force with a deadly weapon.

Consequently, an individual convicted of this offense is removable. Furthermore, the denial of a motion for continuance is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and immigration judges may consider a wide range of factors, including criminal history, in determining ""good cause."" Given that an immigration judge cited such factors, declining to find an abuse of discretion is appropriate.",,,,,,,,"No, the petition for review should be denied.

Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Removability as an ""Aggravated Felony"":**
    *   **Federal Immigration Law:** The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) defines ""aggravated felony"" in Section 101(a)(43) (8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)). This definition includes a long list of offenses.
    *   **""Crime of Violence"":** One key category is a ""crime of violence"" as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 16. This includes offenses that have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or are felonies that, by their nature, involve a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used.
    *   **""Rape"" and ""Sexual Abuse of a Minor"":** The INA also specifically lists ""rape"" and ""sexual abuse of a minor"" as aggravated felonies.
    *   **Application:** ""Aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon"" in Texas would unequivocally qualify as an ""aggravated felony"" under federal immigration law.
        *   It clearly falls under the definition of a ""crime of violence"" due to the inherent use or threatened use of physical force, especially with the inclusion of a ""deadly weapon.""
        *   Depending on the specific elements of the Texas statute, it would also likely qualify as ""rape"" or a severe form of ""sexual abuse"" (if a minor was involved, though not specified, ""aggravated"" often implies severe circumstances).
    *   **Conclusion:** The finding that the individual is removable due to an aggravated felony conviction is legally sound and consistent with federal precedent.

2.  **Denial of Motion for Continuance:**
    *   **Immigration Judge's Discretion:** Immigration Judges (IJs) have broad discretion to grant or deny motions for continuance. This discretion is reviewed by federal courts under an ""abuse of discretion"" standard. An IJ abuses discretion if their decision is arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.
    *   **""Good Cause"":** To be granted a continuance, an applicant must demonstrate ""good cause."" This typically means showing a legitimate reason for the delay, such as needing time to obtain counsel, gather evidence, or pursue a *viable* form of relief from removal.
    *   **Impact of Aggravated Felony:** A conviction for an aggravated felony has severe consequences in immigration law. It renders an individual ineligible for most forms of relief from removal, including asylum (with limited exceptions), cancellation of removal, and voluntary departure.
    *   **Application:** If the individual is ineligible for any form of relief from removal due to the aggravated felony conviction, then seeking a continuance to pursue such relief would be futile. In such a scenario, an IJ's finding that the individual lacked ""good cause"" for a continuance, because there was no viable path to relief, would generally *not* be considered an abuse of discretion by a federal court. The IJ is not required to grant a continuance for a purpose that is legally impossible to achieve.
    *   **Conclusion:** Given the aggravated felony conviction, the individual is likely barred from most forms of relief. Therefore, the IJ's denial of the continuance, finding a lack of ""good cause,"" would almost certainly be upheld by a federal court as a proper exercise of discretion.

In summary, the conviction for aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon is clearly an aggravated felony, making the individual removable. Furthermore, because this conviction likely bars the individual from most forms of relief, the denial of a continuance would not be considered an abuse of discretion. Therefore, the petition for review should be denied.",[],,0.8344781398773193,14.614796557120503,27.751069379238402
"An immigrant invested $500,000 in an American business, believing it would qualify them for an EB-5 immigrant investor visa. USCIS initially approved the I-526 petition but later initiated revocation proceedings, arguing the investment funds (loan proceeds from a jointly owned property) were not entirely the immigrant's ""own capital at risk."" USCIS then issued a decision explicitly stating the visa petition was ""denied,"" not ""revoked."" The immigrant, through new counsel, filed a motion to reopen or reconsider (MTR), citing ineffective assistance of prior counsel and a new interpretation of the loan documents. USCIS denied the MTR. If the immigrant seeks judicial review in federal court, challenging both the ""denial"" of the visa petition and the denial of the MTR, will the federal court have subject matter jurisdiction, and what must the immigrant specifically allege to adequately state a claim regarding the denial of the MTR?","Yes, the federal court will have subject matter jurisdiction.

## I. Subject Matter Jurisdiction in Federal Court

Yes, the federal court will likely have subject matter jurisdiction over both the ""denial"" of the I-526 visa petition and the denial of the motion to reopen or reconsider (MTR).

**A. General Principles of Judicial Review in Immigration:**

Federal courts generally have jurisdiction to review final agency actions under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. However, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) contains specific jurisdictional stripping provisions, primarily INA § 242(a)(2)(B) and (D).

*   **INA § 242(a)(2)(B)(ii):** This provision bars judicial review of ""any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security.""
*   **INA § 242(a)(2)(D):** This crucial provision acts as a ""safety valve,"" stating that nothing in § 242(a)(2)(B) ""shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.""

**B. Jurisdiction Over the ""Denial"" of the I-526 Petition:**

The denial of an I-526 immigrant investor petition is generally reviewable in federal court. While USCIS has discretion in how it adjudicates evidence, the ultimate decision of whether an applicant meets the statutory and regulatory requirements for an EB-5 visa is considered a **question of law** or a **mixed question of law and fact**, not a purely discretionary decision.

*   The core issue here is whether the investment funds (loan proceeds from a jointly owned property) constitute the immigrant's ""own capital at risk"" under 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(j). This involves interpreting the meaning of ""own capital at risk"" and applying that interpretation to the specific financial structure. Such an interpretation and application fall squarely within the ""questions of law"" exception under INA § 242(a)(2)(D).
*   Therefore, the federal court will have subject matter jurisdiction to review the denial of the I-526 petition.

**C. Jurisdiction Over the Denial of the Motion to Reopen or Reconsider (MTR):**

The denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider is typically considered a discretionary decision. However, because the immigrant's MTR cited **ineffective assistance of prior counsel** and a **new interpretation of the loan documents**, the federal court will likely have jurisdiction under INA § 242(a)(2)(D):

1.  **Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (IAC):** A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, particularly when it implicates the fundamental fairness of the administrative proceedings, is generally considered a **constitutional due process claim**. While there is no constitutional right to counsel in civil immigration proceedings, where an immigrant retains counsel, that counsel must be effective enough not to deprive the immigrant of a fair hearing. Thus, the denial of an MTR based on an IAC claim is reviewable as a ""constitutional claim"" under INA § 242(a)(2)(D).
2.  **New Interpretation of Loan Documents:** This argument essentially contends that USCIS made a legal error in its initial interpretation of the EB-5 regulations as applied to the loan documents, or that the new interpretation clarifies how the investment *does* meet the ""own capital at risk"" requirement. This involves a challenge to USCIS's legal interpretation and application of the law, which constitutes a **question of law** reviewable under INA § 242(a)(2)(D).

Therefore, the federal court will have subject matter jurisdiction to review the denial of the MTR.

## II. Specific Allegations for the Denial of the MTR Claim

To adequately state a claim regarding the denial of the MTR, the immigrant must specifically allege that USCIS's denial of the MTR was an **abuse of discretion**. This requires demonstrating that the agency's decision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.

Specifically, the immigrant must allege:

**A. Regarding the Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (IAC) Claim:**

The immigrant must allege that USCIS abused its discretion by denying the MTR despite the presentation of a *prima facie* case of IAC. This typically requires demonstrating:

1.  **Compliance with *Matter of Lozada* / *Matter of Compean* Requirements:**
    *   **Affidavit:** The MTR included an affidavit from the immigrant attesting to the agreement with prior counsel, detailing the specific acts or omissions that constituted deficient performance (e.g., failure to properly explain the ""own capital at risk"" requirement, failure to present a specific legal argument regarding the loan documents).
    *   **Notice to Prior Counsel:** Prior counsel was informed of the allegations and given an opportunity to respond.
    *   **Explanation for Lack of Disciplinary Complaint:** If a complaint was not filed with the appropriate disciplinary authorities, an explanation for this omission was provided.
2.  **Deficient Performance:** Prior counsel's performance fell below an objectively reasonable standard of professional competence. This would involve detailing *how* counsel failed to adequately address the ""own capital at risk"" issue, particularly concerning the loan proceeds from the jointly owned property.
3.  **Prejudice:** But for counsel's deficient performance, the outcome of the I-526 petition *would likely have been different*. This means the immigrant must show that if the ""new interpretation of the loan documents"" or other arguments had been properly presented by prior counsel, the I-526 petition *would have been approved*.
4.  **USCIS's Failure to Properly Consider:** USCIS's denial of the MTR failed to adequately address or provide a reasoned explanation for rejecting the IAC claim, or for finding that the *Lozada* requirements were not met, or that prejudice was not shown.

**B. Regarding the ""New Interpretation of the Loan Documents"" Claim:**

The immigrant must allege that USCIS abused its discretion by denying the MTR despite the presentation of a meritorious new interpretation that would likely lead to a different outcome. This requires demonstrating:

1.  **Materiality:** The ""new interpretation"" is material to the ""own capital at risk"" requirement and directly addresses the grounds for the I-526 denial. It must show how, under this new interpretation, the loan proceeds *do* qualify as the immigrant's ""own capital at risk.""
2.  **Substantive Merit:** The new interpretation is legally sound and, if accepted, would establish the immigrant's eligibility for the EB-5 visa. This means arguing that USCIS's original denial was based on a legal error or a misapplication of the facts to the law, which the new interpretation corrects.
3.  **Reasoned Decision:** USCIS's denial of the MTR failed to provide a reasoned explanation for rejecting this new interpretation, or for concluding that it did not warrant reopening or reconsideration of the I-526 petition. The immigrant must show that USCIS's decision was arbitrary or lacked a rational basis in light of the new arguments presented.

In summary, the immigrant must specifically allege that USCIS's denial of the MTR was an abuse of discretion because it failed to properly consider and give due weight to the compelling IAC claim and the substantively meritorious ""new interpretation"" of the loan documents, which, if accepted, would have established eligibility for the EB-5 visa.",[],,0.8165145516395569,16.509965034965038,23.0032167832168

Here's why:

1.  **Reauthorization and Transition:** The EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 (RIA 2022) fundamentally restructured and reauthorized the regional center program. While the regional center was originally designated in 2010, the RIA 2022 required *all* existing regional centers to seek re-designation under the new statutory framework by filing Form I-956, ""Application for Regional Center Designation."" USCIS has clarified that a regional center is considered ""designated under subparagraph (E)"" of the new Act once it has successfully filed Form I-956 and is authorized to operate under the new rules. Even if it's not sponsoring *new* projects, maintaining its designation to support its 23 pending investors means it must comply with the new Act's requirements.

2.  **Purpose of the Fee:** The Integrity Fund Fee is mandated by Section 203(b)(5)(X) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as added by the RIA 2022. It is an annual fee intended to fund USCIS's oversight, fraud detection, and compliance activities for the entire regional center program. This oversight benefits all regional centers and their investors, including those with pending petitions.

3.  **""Designated under subparagraph (E)"":** USCIS's interpretation and implementation of the RIA 2022 make it clear that any regional center that wishes to maintain its designation and continue to operate (even if only to manage existing investors) must come under the new statutory framework and is therefore considered ""designated under subparagraph (E)"" for the purpose of fee assessment. The act of maintaining its designation, even without new projects, subjects it to the new rules.

4.  **No Retroactivity:** The fee is an *annual* fee, due by October 31st of each year, starting from the fiscal year following the enactment of the RIA 2022. It is not being applied retroactively to years *before* the Act's passage. Instead, it is a prospective fee for the ongoing privilege of maintaining regional center designation and the associated oversight provided by USCIS *from the point the new law became effective*. The regional center is choosing to maintain its designation to support its existing investors, and this ongoing status triggers the annual fee.

**Conclusion:** By maintaining its designation and having ongoing investments with pending investor petitions, the regional center is operating under the reauthorized EB-5 program framework. As such, it is subject to the annual EB-5 Integrity Fund Fee. Given it has 23 pending investors, it would likely be subject to the higher fee amount ($20,000 annually, unless USCIS clarifies that ""investors"" refers only to *new* investors sponsored in the prior fiscal year, which is not the standard interpretation).",[],,0.8380732536315918,15.21283449342614,28.64182972415574

A conviction for conspiracy to commit money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) involving over $10,000 is highly problematic for immigration purposes. Let's break down the legal implications.

**I. Aggravated Felony Analysis**

1.  **Definition of Aggravated Felony for Money Laundering:**
    The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) defines ""aggravated felony"" at INA § 101(a)(43). Specifically, subsection (D) states:
    > ""(D) an offense described in section 1956 of title 18, United States Code (relating to laundering of monetary instruments) or section 1957 of title 18, United States Code (relating to engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity) if the amount of the funds exceeded $10,000;""

    Your client was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h), which is ""conspiracy to commit any offense defined in this section or section 1957."" Federal courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) have consistently held that a conviction for conspiracy to commit an aggravated felony is itself an aggravated felony, provided the underlying substantive offense would be an aggravated felony. Since a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1956 for money laundering involving over $10,000 is explicitly an aggravated felony, a conviction for conspiracy to commit such an offense is also an aggravated felony.

    **Conclusion on Aggravated Felony:** Based on the information provided, your client's conviction for conspiracy to commit money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) involving over $10,000 **will almost certainly be classified as an aggravated felony** for immigration purposes.

2.  **Client's Claim Regarding ""Overt Act"":**
    Your client claims his conviction did not require proof of an overt act. While this may be true for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) (unlike, for example, a general conspiracy charge under 18 U.S.C. § 371, which typically requires an overt act), this fact **does not change the aggravated felony classification**.

    The immigration statute defines an aggravated felony by reference to the *offense described* in 18 U.S.C. § 1956. A conviction for conspiracy under § 1956(h) is a conviction for an offense *related to* and *described within* the scope of § 1956. The elements of the federal conspiracy statute itself (whether it requires an overt act or not) are generally not relevant to determining if the *substantive offense* that was the object of the conspiracy is an aggravated felony. The focus is on the nature of the underlying crime (money laundering over $10,000), not the specific elements of the conspiracy charge itself. Therefore, this argument is unlikely to succeed in challenging the aggravated felony finding.

**II. Consequences of an Aggravated Felony Finding**

1.  **Removability:**
    An alien convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable (removable) under INA § 237(a)(2)(A)(iii). Your client, even though lawfully present on an H1B, will be found removable.

2.  **Bars to Relief from Removal:**
    This is the most devastating consequence. An aggravated felony conviction bars an individual from nearly all forms of relief from removal, including:
    *   **Cancellation of Removal:** Both for lawful permanent residents (INA § 240A(a)) and non-permanent residents (INA § 240A(b)).
    *   **Asylum:** An alien convicted of an aggravated felony is statutorily barred from asylum (INA § 208(b)(2)(A)(ii)). The conviction is considered a ""particularly serious crime.""
    *   **Adjustment of Status:** Generally, an aggravated felony conviction makes an individual inadmissible and/or deportable, thus barring adjustment of status.
    *   **Waivers of Inadmissibility/Removability:** Most waivers, such as INA § 212(h) (for certain criminal grounds of inadmissibility) and INA § 212(c) (for LPRs, though largely replaced by cancellation), are unavailable to aggravated felons. There are very limited exceptions, but they are highly specific and unlikely to apply here.

3.  **Withholding of Removal and Convention Against Torture (CAT):**
    These are not forms of relief that allow an individual to remain in the U.S. permanently, but rather protections against removal to a specific country where the individual fears persecution or torture.
    *   **Withholding of Removal:** An aggravated felony conviction is considered a ""particularly serious crime,"" which bars eligibility for statutory withholding of removal if the aggregate sentence of imprisonment is 5 years or more. Even if the sentence is less than 5 years, an immigration judge can still determine that the crime is ""particularly serious"" based on the facts and circumstances, thus barring withholding. Given the nature of money laundering, it's highly probable it would be deemed a ""particularly serious crime.""
    *   **Convention Against Torture (CAT):** This is the most difficult form of relief to obtain but is the only one that is *not* barred by an aggravated felony conviction or a ""particularly serious crime"" finding. To qualify, your client must demonstrate that it is ""more likely than not"" that he would be tortured if removed to the proposed country. This is a very high burden of proof.

**III. Procedural Challenges to Removal Proceedings**

Your client's claims regarding procedural flaws are significant and could potentially lead to the termination or remand of his removal proceedings.

1.  **Defective Notice to Appear (NTA):**
    *   **Pereira v. Sessions (2018) and Niz-Chavez v. Garland (2021):** These Supreme Court cases established that for an NTA to be ""proper"" and trigger the ""stop-time rule"" for cancellation of removal purposes, it must include the specific time and date of the initial hearing.
    *   **Jurisdictional Implications:** While *Pereira* and *Niz-Chavez* primarily addressed the stop-time rule, some circuits and the BIA have grappled with whether a defective NTA deprives the immigration court of subject matter jurisdiction. The BIA has held that a defective NTA does not deprive the IJ of jurisdiction if a subsequent hearing notice provides the missing information. However, this area of law is still evolving, and depending on the circuit, a strong argument can be made that a fundamentally defective NTA (one that never specified a time/date) could lead to termination of proceedings.
    *   **Impact on Your Client:** If the NTA served on your client did not specify the time and date of his initial hearing, this is a strong argument to challenge the proceedings. Even if it doesn't terminate the case, it could affect other aspects, though for an aggravated felon, the direct relief options are already severely limited.

2.  **Missing Hearing Transcripts:**
    *   **Due Process:** The right to a full and accurate record of proceedings is a fundamental aspect of due process. If significant portions of the hearing transcripts are missing, it can make effective appellate review impossible.
    *   **Remedy:** If the transcripts cannot be reconstructed, the typical remedy is for the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) to remand the case to the Immigration Judge for a new hearing or to terminate proceedings if the record is so deficient that a fair hearing cannot be ensured. This could provide a temporary reprieve and a chance to re-litigate certain issues, but it does not erase the underlying conviction or its aggravated felony status.

**IV. Summary and Recommendations**

*   **Aggravated Felony Status:** It is highly probable that your client's conviction will be classified as an aggravated felony, making him removable and barring him from most forms of relief. His ""overt act"" argument is unlikely to succeed.
*   **Waivers of Inadmissibility:** Waivers of inadmissibility are generally not available to aggravated felons, especially for removability based on an aggravated felony.
*   **Procedural Challenges:** The defective NTA and missing transcripts are significant procedural issues that should be vigorously pursued. These could lead to termination of proceedings or a remand for a new hearing, offering a temporary reprieve and a chance to present arguments again. However, they do not eliminate the underlying aggravated felony conviction.
*   **Limited Relief:** The only potential avenues for relief, albeit extremely difficult, would be Withholding of Removal or CAT, if he can meet the high burden of proof and overcome the ""particularly serious crime"" bar for withholding.

**Urgent Recommendation:**

Your client needs an experienced immigration attorney immediately. This is a highly specialized and complex area of law. The attorney should:

1.  **Obtain and review all court documents** related to the criminal conviction to confirm the exact nature of the offense, the statute of conviction, and the sentence.
2.  **Obtain and review the entire immigration court record** (A-file), including the Notice to Appear and all hearing transcripts, to thoroughly assess the procedural challenges.
3.  **Determine the best strategy** for challenging the aggravated felony finding (if any narrow avenue exists, which is unlikely here), pursuing the procedural flaws, and exploring any extremely limited forms of relief like CAT.
4.  **Advise the client on the severe consequences** and the very limited options available.

"An individual is found removable under U.S. immigration law as an alien convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude. One of the convictions is for making terroristic threats in violation of section 609.713, subdivision 1, of the Minnesota Statutes. The individual argues this specific offense is not a crime involving moral turpitude. Based on U.S. federal immigration court precedent, how would this argument likely be addressed regarding the classification of the Minnesota terroristic threats offense?","The offense of making terroristic threats in violation of section 609.713, subdivision 1, of the Minnesota Statutes is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude. The communication of an intent to injure another by use of violence, made either with the specific intent to ""terrorize"" another or with a conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk of terrorizing another, is reprehensible conduct. Furthermore, making threats with purpose to cause evacuation of a building, place of assembly, vehicle or facility of public transportation or otherwise to cause serious public inconvenience, or in a reckless disregard of the risk of causing such inconvenience, is also reprehensible conduct.",,,,,,,,"The offense of making terroristic threats in violation of section 609.713, subdivision 1, of the Minnesota Statutes is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude.

Furthermore, making threats with purpose to cause evacuation of a building, place of assembly, vehicle or facility of public transportation or otherwise to cause serious public inconvenience, or in a reckless disregard of the risk of causing such inconvenience, is also reprehensible conduct.","Based on U.S. federal immigration court precedent, the individual's argument that the Minnesota terroristic threats offense is not a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT) would **likely be rejected**.

Here's how the argument would typically be addressed:

1.  **Controlling Precedent: *Matter of J-G-P-***
    The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has directly addressed the classification of terroristic threats as a CIMT. In *Matter of J-G-P-*, 25 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 2010), the BIA held that a conviction for making terroristic threats under a Texas statute was a crime involving moral turpitude.

2.  **Reasoning in *Matter of J-G-P-***
    The BIA's reasoning focused on the inherent nature of the offense:
    *   **Mens Rea (Intent):** The BIA emphasized that terroristic threat statutes typically require a specific intent to terrorize, to place a person in fear of serious bodily injury, or to cause a serious public inconvenience (e.g., evacuation). This intent to cause fear, alarm, or disruption through threats of violence demonstrates a ""base, vile, or depraved act contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general.""
    *   **Nature of the Act:** The act of making threats designed to instill fear or cause serious disruption is considered inherently reprehensible and morally turpitudinous. It goes beyond mere recklessness or negligence and involves a malicious or evil intent.

3.  **Application to Minnesota Statutes § 609.713, subdivision 1**
    While the specific text of the Minnesota statute would be analyzed under the categorical approach (or modified categorical approach if necessary), terroristic threat statutes generally share core elements that align with the BIA's reasoning in *Matter of J-G-P-*.
    *   Minnesota Statutes § 609.713, subdivision 1, typically requires an intent to terrorize another or cause evacuation, or to cause serious public inconvenience, or to recklessly disregard the risk of causing such terror or inconvenience. The intent to terrorize or cause fear of serious harm is the critical element.
    *   If the Minnesota statute, like the Texas statute in *J-G-P-*, requires an intent to cause fear of violence or serious disruption, or a reckless disregard for causing such fear, it would almost certainly be found to involve moral turpitude. The ""reckless disregard"" element, when tied to causing terror or serious public inconvenience, has also been found sufficient for CIMT classification in this context, as it implies a conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that is a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe.

**Conclusion:**

Given the strong precedent set by *Matter of J-G-P-*, an immigration court would likely find that a conviction under Minnesota Statutes § 609.713, subdivision 1, for making terroristic threats, is a crime involving moral turpitude. The individual's argument would likely fail because the offense, by its nature and required intent, is considered to involve a base or depraved act contrary to accepted moral standards.",[],,0.819733738899231,14.81900537634409,30.22850806451615
"Can a foreign investor compel U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to expedite the processing of their Form I-526 application for an EB-5 immigrant visa, alleging an unreasonable 30-month delay that has led to mental and physical health issues, when USCIS follows a visa availability approach and Congress has not set a binding timeline for such adjudications?","No, a foreign investor cannot compel USCIS to expedite processing under these circumstances.

Here's a breakdown of why:

1.  **Lack of Statutory Deadline:** The most significant hurdle is that Congress has not set a binding statutory timeline for USCIS to adjudicate I-526 petitions. Courts are generally reluctant to impose deadlines on administrative agencies when Congress has not done so.

2.  **Judicial Deference to Agency Processing:** Courts typically grant significant deference to an agency's internal processing priorities and resource allocation. USCIS's ""visa availability approach"" for EB-5 petitions is a legitimate, congressionally mandated framework for managing the limited number of visas available and the per-country caps. This means petitions are often processed in the order their priority dates become current, not necessarily in the order they are received or based on individual hardship.

3.  **""Unreasonable Delay"" Standard (Mandamus/APA):** While an investor *could* theoretically file a lawsuit under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) alleging ""unreasonable delay"" (5 U.S.C. § 706(1)), the standard for proving such a claim is very high, especially in immigration cases. Courts consider several factors, including:
    *   **Time agency takes vs. statutory limits:** As noted, there are none here.
    *   **Prejudice to the petitioner:** The mental and physical health issues would be strong evidence of prejudice.
    *   **Impact on public health/welfare:** Less relevant for an individual I-526.
    *   **Agency explanation for delay:** USCIS would argue resource constraints, high volume, complexity of EB-5 adjudications, and the necessity of adhering to the visa availability queue.
    *   **Agency priority setting:** USCIS's priority setting (e.g., national security, family reunification, then employment-based categories like EB-5, and within EB-5, priority date order) is generally respected by courts.

    A 30-month delay, while significant and distressing for the individual, is unfortunately not uncommon for complex immigration petitions like the I-526, especially given backlogs and the visa availability system. Courts have often found even longer delays to be ""reasonable"" in the absence of a statutory deadline, particularly when the agency has a legitimate explanation for its processing order.

4.  **Discretionary Expedite Requests vs. Compulsion:** An investor *can* submit an expedite request directly to USCIS based on severe hardship, including compelling health issues. USCIS has specific criteria for granting such requests (e.g., severe financial loss, urgent humanitarian reasons, national interest). However, granting an expedite request is entirely *discretionary* for USCIS. A court cannot compel USCIS to grant a discretionary expedite request unless there's a clear abuse of discretion, which is very difficult to prove.

**Conclusion:**

While the investor's situation is undoubtedly difficult and the health issues are serious, the legal framework makes it exceedingly challenging to compel USCIS to expedite an I-526 application. The absence of a statutory deadline, combined with judicial deference to USCIS's processing priorities (especially the visa availability approach for EB-5), means a court would likely side with USCIS. The investor's best course of action would be to formally submit an expedite request to USCIS, providing comprehensive medical documentation, and to engage with their congressional representatives for assistance, though these avenues do not guarantee success.",[],,0.8261759877204895,15.181226201571029,18.03511583011587
"Is sexual solicitation of a minor, in violation of section 3-324(b) of the Maryland Criminal Law, categorically a crime involving moral turpitude, and how does this affect an alien's eligibility for cancellation of removal, particularly concerning the mental state required regarding the victim's age?","Sexual solicitation of a minor in violation of section 3-324(b) of the Maryland Criminal Law with the intent to engage in an unlawful sexual offense under section 3-307 is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude, even when the statute requires no culpable mental state as to the age of the child.

Therefore, the respondent in this case is not found removable on the CIMT ground and remains statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal, with the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for discretionary review of relief.","Based on general principles of immigration law regarding Crimes Involving Moral Turpitude (CIMT) and how courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) interpret such offenses, here's an analysis of your question:

1.  **Is sexual solicitation of a minor (MD CL 3-324(b)) categorically a Crime Involving Moral Turpitude (CIMT)?**

    Yes, it is highly probable that sexual solicitation of a minor, in violation of section 3-324(b) of the Maryland Criminal Law, would be considered **categorically a Crime Involving Moral Turpitude (CIMT)**.

    *   **Definition of CIMT:** A CIMT generally involves conduct that is inherently base, vile, or depraved, and contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general. It typically requires a culpable mental state (mens rea) and a morally reprehensible act.
    *   **Sexual Offenses Against Minors:** Sexual offenses, especially those involving minors, are almost universally considered CIMTs. The vulnerability of the victim and the inherent depravity of exploiting a child for sexual purposes are central to this determination.
    *   **Categorical Analysis:** For a crime to be ""categorically"" a CIMT, every conviction under the statute must necessarily involve moral turpitude. A statute prohibiting ""sexual solicitation of a minor"" inherently describes conduct that is vile and depraved. The act of soliciting a minor for sex, by its very nature, offends accepted moral standards. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that there would be any scenario under this specific statute that would *not* involve moral turpitude.

2.  **How does this affect an alien's eligibility for cancellation of removal, particularly concerning the mental state required regarding the victim's age?**

    A conviction for a CIMT, such as sexual solicitation of a minor, has severe negative consequences for an alien's eligibility for cancellation of removal.

    *   **Impact on Cancellation of Removal:**
        *   **Good Moral Character (GMC):** To be eligible for cancellation of removal (both for lawful permanent residents under INA 240A(a) and non-LPRs under INA 240A(b)), an alien must demonstrate ""good moral character"" for a specified period (e.g., 5 or 10 years). A conviction for a CIMT, especially one as serious as sexual solicitation of a minor, generally precludes a finding of good moral character. Under INA 101(f)(3), a person who has been convicted of two or more CIMTs is statutorily barred from establishing GMC. Even a single CIMT can be a discretionary bar to GMC.
        *   **Statutory Bar for Non-LPR Cancellation (INA 240A(b)):** For non-lawful permanent residents seeking cancellation of removal, INA 240A(b)(1)(C) explicitly states that an alien is ineligible if they have been convicted of an offense under INA 212(a)(2), 237(a)(2), or 237(a)(3). CIMTs are listed as grounds of inadmissibility (INA 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I)) and deportability (INA 237(a)(2)(A)(i)). Therefore, a conviction for sexual solicitation of a minor (a CIMT) would directly render an alien ineligible for non-LPR cancellation of removal, unless it falls under the very narrow ""petty offense"" exception, which is highly unlikely for this type of crime.
        *   **Aggravated Felony:** Depending on the specific details of the Maryland statute and the sentence imposed, sexual solicitation of a minor could also potentially be classified as an ""aggravated felony"" under INA 101(a)(43)(A) (crime of violence) or (U) (offense relating to sexual abuse of a minor). An aggravated felony conviction is an even more severe bar, making an alien ineligible for almost all forms of relief, including cancellation of removal.

    *   **Mental State Required Regarding the Victim's Age:**
        *   For a crime to be a CIMT, it generally requires a culpable mental state (mens rea). However, in the context of sex crimes against minors, the BIA and federal courts have consistently held that **knowledge of the victim's age is generally *not* required** for the offense to be considered a CIMT.
        *   The turpitude in such crimes stems from the inherent depravity of engaging in sexual conduct (or solicitation) with someone who *is* a minor, regardless of whether the perpetrator knew the victim's exact age. The ""evil intent"" or moral turpitude is found in the intent to engage in the sexual act or solicitation itself, and the fact that the victim is a minor makes that act turpitudinous.
        *   Unless the specific statute includes a ""reasonable mistake of age"" defense that, if successfully asserted, would negate the turpitudinous nature of the act, the lack of knowledge of the victim's age typically does not prevent the crime from being classified as a CIMT. The focus is on the act of exploiting a minor, which is inherently morally reprehensible.

In summary, a conviction for sexual solicitation of a minor under Maryland Criminal Law 3-324(b) would almost certainly be deemed a categorical Crime Involving Moral Turpitude. This conviction would severely jeopardize an alien's eligibility for cancellation of removal by precluding a finding of good moral character and often serving as a direct statutory bar, irrespective of whether the alien knew the victim's exact age.",[],,0.8272252678871155,16.365786826934876,23.06016803630567
"Under U.S. federal immigration law, can a former government employee of a foreign country's prison system, who received military training and monitored inmates, establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal based on a fear of persecution from criminal gangs, if the perceived threat stems from the nature of their former employment rather than an immutable characteristic, a protected social group, or a statutorily recognized political opinion?","The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied the petition for review, affirming the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision that the petitioner, a former employee of El Salvador's Ministry of Justice, was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal.

However, there might be a very narrow possibility for **withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture (CAT)**, which has different requirements.

Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Asylum and Statutory Withholding of Removal (INA § 208 and § 241(b)(3)):**
    *   **""On Account Of"" Requirement:** To qualify for asylum or statutory withholding, an applicant must demonstrate a well-founded fear (for asylum) or a clear probability (for statutory withholding) of persecution *on account of* one of five protected grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group (PSG), or political opinion.
    *   **The Problem in This Scenario:** The question explicitly states that the threat *does not* stem from an immutable characteristic, a protected social group, or a statutorily recognized political opinion.
        *   **Political Opinion:** While enforcing laws might be seen as a governmental function, it's generally not considered a ""political opinion"" in the asylum context unless the individual actively expressed a specific political belief that led to their persecution. Simply doing one's job, even a law enforcement one, is usually insufficient.
        *   **Particular Social Group (PSG):** U.S. immigration courts have generally been reluctant to recognize occupational groups (like ""former prison guards"") as PSGs unless the occupation itself is inextricably linked to one of the other protected grounds or an immutable characteristic. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and federal courts have emphasized that a PSG must be composed of members who share a common, immutable characteristic that is fundamental to their individual identities, and that the group must be ""particular"" and ""socially visible"" or ""cohesive."" Persecution stemming from a personal vendetta, revenge for past actions, or the general dangers of a particular job is typically not considered persecution ""on account of"" a PSG. The threat here appears to be a consequence of the individual's actions in their job, rather than their inherent identity.
    *   **Nexus:** Even if one could argue for a PSG, there must be a clear ""nexus"" – a direct link – between the persecution and the protected ground. If gangs are targeting former guards simply for revenge, to eliminate witnesses, or because they are perceived as adversaries, that is typically viewed as criminal activity or a personal vendetta, not persecution ""on account of"" a protected ground.

2.  **Withholding of Removal Under the Convention Against Torture (CAT):**
    *   **No ""On Account Of"" Requirement:** This is the critical difference. CAT does *not* require the applicant to prove persecution on account of race, religion, etc.
    *   **Requirements:** To qualify for CAT withholding, the applicant must demonstrate that it is ""more likely than not"" that they would be tortured if removed to the country in question. Torture is defined as severe physical or mental pain or suffering intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.
    *   **Application to This Scenario:**
        *   **Torture:** The actions of criminal gangs *could* rise to the level of torture if they involve severe physical or mental pain or suffering.
        *   **Public Official Acquiescence:** This is the crucial element. The applicant would need to prove that the foreign government (or public officials within it) is *aware* of the gang's activities targeting former prison employees and is *unwilling or unable to intervene* to prevent the torture. This could involve demonstrating widespread corruption, police complicity with gangs, or a complete breakdown of law and order where the government effectively allows gangs to operate with impunity against certain populations.
    *   **High Burden of Proof:** Proving government ""acquiescence"" can be very challenging, requiring specific evidence of the government's knowledge and failure to act.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the explicit constraints of the question (threat *not* stemming from an immutable characteristic, protected social group, or political opinion), eligibility for **asylum** or **statutory withholding of removal** would be highly unlikely.

The only potential avenue would be **withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture (CAT)**, but this would require the applicant to demonstrate a ""more likely than not"" probability of torture and, critically, that such torture would be inflicted by or with the **acquiescence of a public official** in their home country. This is a high evidentiary bar.",[],,0.8213101625442505,17.84176470588236,18.387171945701397
"Can a U.S. federal agency refuse to fulfill a broadly worded FOIA request seeking all emails from high-ranking officials over a period of several months if the agency determines that the effort required for review, redaction, and production is unduly burdensome, even if the request describes the documents with sufficient precision to locate them?","Yes, a U.S. federal agency can refuse such a request. Binding precedent in the D.C. Circuit establishes that an agency need not respond to requests that entail an unduly burdensome effort of review, redaction, and production, even if the documents are described with sufficient precision. In this case, the requests sought ""all records sent or received electronically"" by three high-ranking officials over a nine-month period, yielding over 1.6 million pages and an estimated processing time of over two years and nine months (8,151 hours). The Court found this burden too high, particularly because the requests were not tailored to specific policy concerns, thus requiring the agency to process thousands of documents with no conceivable relation to the requester's stated interest (e.g., workplace emails about miscellaneous topics or health care plans). The Court also noted the risk of severe interference with the agency's IT systems due to the large data transfer. Therefore, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of the agency, concluding that the requests required an unduly burdensome post-search effort.",,,,,,,,"Yes, a U.S. federal agency can refuse such a request. Binding precedent in the D.C. Circuit establishes that an agency need not respond to requests that entail an unduly burdensome effort of review, redaction, and production, even if the documents are described with sufficient precision. In this case, the requests sought ""all records sent or received electronically"" by three high-ranking officials over a nine-month period, yielding over 1.6 million pages and an estimated processing time of over two years and nine months (8,151 hours). The Court found this burden too high, particularly because the requests were not tailored to specific policy concerns, thus requiring the agency to process thousands of documents with no conceivable relation to the requester's stated interest (e.g., workplace emails about miscellaneous topics or health care plans). The Court also noted the risk of severe interference with the agency's IT systems due to the large data transfer. Therefore, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of the agency, concluding that the requests required an unduly burdensome post-search effort.","Yes, a U.S. federal agency **can refuse** to fulfill a broadly worded FOIA request seeking all emails from high-ranking officials over a period of several months if the agency determines that the effort required for review, redaction, and production is unduly burdensome, even if the request describes the documents with sufficient precision to locate them.

Here's why:

1.  **""Reasonably Described"" Standard:** FOIA requires that a request ""reasonably describe"" the records sought. While ""sufficient precision to locate them"" addresses one aspect of ""reasonably described,"" it's not the only factor. The ""reasonably described"" standard also implicitly requires that the request not be so broad or burdensome as to effectively paralyze the agency's ability to respond or to force it to undertake an unreasonable search or review effort.

2.  **Undue Burden:** The burden on an agency isn't just about *finding* the documents. It primarily involves:
    *   **Review:** Each email must be reviewed individually to identify responsive content and determine if any FOIA exemptions apply (e.g., personal privacy, deliberative process, national security, attorney-client privilege).
    *   **Redaction:** If exemptions apply, the agency must redact the exempt portions while releasing the non-exempt portions. This can be a highly time-consuming and labor-intensive process, especially for a large volume of emails.
    *   **Production:** Preparing the documents for release in a usable format.

    A request for ""all emails from high-ranking officials over several months"" can easily encompass tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of emails. Reviewing such a volume for exemptions and performing necessary redactions would consume an enormous amount of agency resources, potentially diverting staff from their primary duties.

3.  **Agency's Obligation to Assist:** While an agency can refuse on grounds of undue burden, it typically cannot simply issue a blanket denial. Agencies are generally required to:
    *   **Communicate with the Requester:** Inform the requester that the request is unduly burdensome.
    *   **Offer Assistance:** Work with the requester to narrow the scope of the request (e.g., by specifying particular topics, narrower date ranges, or specific keywords) to make it manageable. This is often referred to as ""perfecting"" the request.
    *   **Process a Manageable Portion:** If the requester is unwilling or unable to narrow the request sufficiently, the agency might offer to process a manageable portion of the request (e.g., emails from a single official for a shorter period) as a good-faith effort.

4.  **Administrative Appeal and Judicial Review:** If the agency ultimately denies the request as unduly burdensome after attempting to narrow it, the requester has the right to file an administrative appeal within the agency. If that appeal is denied, the requester can then sue the agency in federal court. A court would then review whether the agency's determination of undue burden was reasonable and justified. The agency would need to provide evidence (e.g., affidavits detailing the estimated volume of records, the time required for review and redaction, and the resources that would be consumed) to support its claim.

In summary, while FOIA promotes transparency, it also recognizes practical limitations on agency resources. A request that, even if locatable, would require an unreasonable expenditure of time and effort for review and redaction can be legitimately refused as unduly burdensome, provided the agency has made good-faith efforts to help the requester narrow the scope.",[],,0.835345447063446,14.089172932330829,27.891353383458664
"A manufacturing company, facing numerous charges for failing to verify employee work authorization and knowingly continuing to employ unauthorized aliens, seeks to overturn an administrative law judge's decision. The company argues that it acted in good faith by hiring a purportedly qualified HR director whose negligence led to the violations. It also claims that many violations are barred by the five-year statute of limitations. Furthermore, the company challenges the summarily imposed civil penalties, arguing that its severe financial distress (including significant net losses and pending bankruptcy) constitutes a material factual dispute regarding its ability to pay, which should have precluded summary determination of the penalty amount. How would a federal court likely rule on each of these arguments?","A federal court would likely rule as follows:
1.  **Good Faith Defense:** The court would likely reject the good faith defenses. The defense under 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(a)(3) applies only to knowing *hiring* violations, not *continuing employment* or *paperwork* violations. The defense under 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(6) is limited to *technical or procedural* failures, not substantive ones, and the HR director's failure to perform their duties would be properly imputed to the company as its agent.
2.  **Statute of Limitations (General):** The court would likely reject a generalized statute of limitations defense for most violations if it was not properly asserted with a statement of facts as required by 28 C.F.R. § 68.9(c). For paperwork violations, the five-year limitations period is measured from when the company was no longer required to retain the I-9 form (three years after hire or one year after termination, whichever is later). For continuing employment violations, it is measured from the last day of the ineligible alien's employment.
3.  **Statute of Limitations (Specific Untimely Claim):** However, the court would likely grant the petition for review as to a specific violation if the claim accrued more than five years before the administrative action was commenced (e.g., employment ended before the five-year window) and the agency itself had conceded the untimeliness. The limitations period begins when the claim first accrued, not when the penalty is administratively imposed.
4.  **Summary Determination of Penalty:** The court would likely uphold the summary determination of the penalty. While ""ability to pay"" is a factor that an ALJ may consider at their discretion, it is not one of the five mandatory factors listed in 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(e)(5). Because it is within the ALJ's power to decline to consider this factor at all, the company's ability to pay is not considered a *material* issue of fact that would preclude summary determination of the penalty amount. The ALJ's decision to proceed despite ambiguities in financial evidence would be considered an implicit choice to give that factor no weight, and this does not warrant reversal. The court would also typically uphold the ALJ's consideration of the statutory factors (size of business, good faith, seriousness of violations, whether the employee is an unauthorized alien, and history of previous violations) if the penalty falls within the prescribed monetary range and is reasonably based on the evidence presented.",,,,,,,,"A federal court would likely rule as follows:

1.  **Argument: Good Faith by Hiring a Negligent HR Director**
    *   **Likely Ruling: The court would likely REJECT this argument.**
    *   **Reasoning:** Employers have a non-delegable duty to comply with immigration laws, specifically regarding I-9 verification and not knowingly employing unauthorized aliens. While hiring an HR director is an attempt to ensure compliance, the company remains ultimately responsible for the actions and omissions of its employees in this regard.
        *   **Failure to Verify (Paperwork Violations):** These are often considered strict liability or at least require a showing of negligence. The negligence of an HR director, even if ""purportedly qualified,"" is imputed to the company. The company cannot escape liability for its own failure to ensure proper procedures were followed by simply pointing to an employee's error.
        *   **Knowingly Employing Unauthorized Aliens:** ""Knowledge"" can be actual or constructive. If the HR director knew or should have known that employees were unauthorized (e.g., ignored red flags, failed to re-verify, accepted obviously fraudulent documents), that knowledge is imputed to the company. The company cannot claim ""good faith"" when its own agent (the HR director) was negligent or complicit in the violations. While good faith *efforts* can sometimes mitigate penalties, they generally do not absolve an employer of liability for violations, especially when the violations are widespread or involve knowing employment.

2.  **Argument: Many Violations Barred by the Five-Year Statute of Limitations**
    *   **Likely Ruling: The court would likely AGREE with the company in part.**
    *   **Reasoning:** The general federal statute of limitations for civil penalties, 28 U.S.C. § 2462, applies to I-9 violations, imposing a **five-year limit** from the date the claim accrues.
        *   **Accrual:** For I-9 paperwork violations (e.g., failure to properly complete an I-9, failure to re-verify), the claim generally accrues when the violation occurs (e.g., when the I-9 was improperly completed or when re-verification was due).
        *   **Knowingly Employing:** For ""knowingly continuing to employ"" unauthorized aliens, the violation can be considered ongoing. However, penalties can typically only be assessed for the portion of the knowing employment that falls within the five-year period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint or notice of intent to fine. If the initial act of hiring or the initial knowledge occurred more than five years ago, but the employment continued with knowledge within the five-year window, penalties could still be assessed for that more recent period.
        *   Therefore, any specific violations (especially paperwork violations) that occurred more than five years before the government initiated its enforcement action would likely be deemed time-barred. The company would likely succeed in getting those specific charges dismissed.

3.  **Argument: Financial Distress as a Material Factual Dispute Precluding Summary Determination of Penalties**
    *   **Likely Ruling: The court would likely AGREE with the company.**
    *   **Reasoning:** When determining the amount of civil penalties for I-9 violations, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and relevant regulations require consideration of several factors, including:
        *   The size of the business
        *   The employer's good faith
        *   The seriousness of the violation
        *   The history of previous violations
        *   **The ability to pay**
    *   The company's claim of ""severe financial distress, including significant net losses and pending bankruptcy,"" directly relates to the ""ability to pay"" factor. This is a **material factual dispute** that should be thoroughly considered before imposing a final penalty amount. Summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact. By presenting evidence of financial distress, the company has raised a genuine issue regarding its ability to pay the summarily imposed penalties.
    *   An ALJ cannot summarily impose penalties without allowing the company to present evidence and argue for a reduction based on its financial situation. The court would likely **remand** the case back to the administrative level for a hearing or further proceedings specifically on the appropriate penalty amount, taking into account the company's financial condition.",[],,0.8377835750579834,15.368880503144656,22.634924528301894

Here's a breakdown of the legal challenges:

### I. Money Damages Against Federal Officials in Their Individual Capacities (Constitutional Violations)

An individual seeking money damages against federal officials for constitutional violations would typically rely on a *Bivens* action (derived from *Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents*). However, the landscape for *Bivens* claims has been significantly narrowed by recent Supreme Court precedent, particularly *Ziglar v. Abbasi* (2017).

1.  **The *Bivens* Hurdle (Ziglar v. Abbasi):**
    *   The Supreme Court has made it clear that creating new *Bivens* remedies is a ""disfavored judicial activity.""
    *   Courts now apply a two-step test:
        1.  **New Context:** Is the case different in a meaningful way from the three existing *Bivens* cases (Fourth Amendment search, Fifth Amendment sex discrimination, Eighth Amendment inadequate medical care)? A family separation policy involving asylum seekers at the border would almost certainly be considered a ""new context.""
        2.  **Special Factors Counselling Hesitation:** If it's a new context, are there ""special factors counselling hesitation"" against creating a new *Bivens* remedy? This is the critical hurdle.
            *   **Immigration Policy:** Courts are highly deferential to Congress and the Executive Branch in matters of immigration and national security. The Supreme Court has indicated that the existence of a comprehensive legislative scheme (like federal immigration law) is a strong ""special factor"" weighing against judicial creation of a *Bivens* remedy.
            *   **Complex Policy Judgments:** Family separation policies involve complex policy judgments, resource allocation, and border security considerations, which courts are generally reluctant to second-guess through *Bivens* actions.
            *   **Alternative Remedies:** Even if not perfect, Congress has provided various administrative and judicial remedies within the immigration system (e.g., habeas corpus challenges to detention, administrative complaints). The existence of *any* alternative, even if not money damages, can weigh against a *Bivens* remedy.

2.  **Qualified Immunity:**
    *   Even if a *Bivens* remedy were to be recognized (which is highly improbable), federal officials would almost certainly assert qualified immunity.
    *   Qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages unless their conduct violates ""clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.""
    *   **""Clearly Established"" Right:** While the right to family integrity is a fundamental constitutional right, its application in the specific context of asylum seekers at the border, under a novel and controversial policy, and whether officials *knew* their specific actions violated *clearly established* law in *that precise context*, would be a very difficult argument for the plaintiff to win. Officials could argue they were implementing a policy they believed to be lawful, or that the law was not sufficiently clear to put them on notice that their actions were unconstitutional.

**Conclusion for Money Damages:** Given the severe restrictions on *Bivens* actions and the strong likelihood of qualified immunity applying, an individual asylum seeker would face immense, likely insurmountable, challenges in successfully suing federal officials for money damages.

### II. Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Against Federal Agencies and Officials in Their Official Capacities

This type of relief (stopping an ongoing or future unconstitutional action) is typically sought under *Ex parte Young* (which allows suits against state officials to enjoin unconstitutional conduct, and is applied similarly to federal officials for prospective relief, bypassing sovereign immunity). However, the conditions described (""after being reunited with their child and the policy being altered and enjoined"") introduce a critical legal doctrine: **mootness**.

1.  **Mootness Doctrine:**
    *   Federal courts can only hear ""cases and controversies"" (Article III of the Constitution). A case becomes moot if the controversy no longer exists.
    *   **Application:**
        *   **Reunification:** The individual plaintiff's specific injury (separation from their child) has ended because they have been reunited.
        *   **Policy Altered and Enjoined:** The challenged policy itself has been changed or stopped, likely through other litigation (e.g., class action lawsuits like *Ms. L. v. ICE*) or executive action. This means there is no ongoing or future unconstitutional conduct for the court to enjoin with respect to *this specific policy*.
    *   **Lack of Ongoing Injury:** For a court to grant injunctive or declaratory relief, the plaintiff must demonstrate a ""real and immediate threat"" of future harm. Since the plaintiff is reunited and the policy is no longer in effect, they cannot show such a threat.

2.  **Exceptions to Mootness (Unlikely to Apply Here):**
    *   **""Capable of repetition, yet evading review"":** This exception applies when the duration of the challenged action is too short to be fully litigated before it ceases, but there's a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subjected to the same action again. While family separation was short-term for individuals, the *policy itself* was challenged and enjoined, so it's not ""evading review"" in a broader sense. And for *this specific individual*, there's no reasonable expectation they would be subjected to the *same* policy again after reunification and the policy's alteration.
    *   **Voluntary Cessation:** If a defendant voluntarily ceases the challenged conduct, the case is not moot unless the defendant can show it is ""absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur."" Given the policy was ""altered and enjoined,"" this standard would likely be met, making the case moot.

**Conclusion for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief:** The individual's claim for prospective relief would almost certainly be dismissed as moot. The specific harm to the plaintiff has ceased, and the policy itself has been addressed, leaving no ongoing controversy for the court to resolve through an injunction or declaration. Such relief would typically be sought in a class action *before* the policy is altered or enjoined, or by individuals *while* they are still separated.

**Overall Summary:**

An individual asylum seeker, after being reunited with their child and the family separation policy being altered and enjoined, would face insurmountable legal hurdles in suing for money damages due to the restrictive *Bivens* framework and qualified immunity, and would almost certainly have their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief dismissed as moot.",[],,0.8115919828414917,16.31626775994911,18.965780730897052
"A group of international students, who were unknowingly enrolled in a sham university created by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as part of a sting operation, received letters terminating their F-1 nonimmigrant student status due to ""fraudulent enrollment."" They filed a class action lawsuit challenging this termination under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging due process violations, and seeking an order preventing the government from deeming their enrollment fraudulent. The District Court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that the termination was not a final agency action and the case was not ripe for review because reinstatement proceedings were pending or removal proceedings could provide administrative relief.

Unlike asylum terminations, the F-1 termination was the culmination, not the initiation, of the agency's decision-making process. Furthermore, the students are not required to wait for removal proceedings to be instituted, as such proceedings may never occur, and immigration judges and the Board of Immigration Appeals lack the authority to review USCIS's discretionary denial of reinstatement. The case is also ripe for review because the parties are in a sufficiently adversarial posture, the students are genuinely aggrieved by the termination of their lawful status and the notation of fraud on their records, and the government's inconsistent position on the students' culpability underscores the need for judicial review that would otherwise be unavailable.",,,,,,,,"Yes, the students' claims for judicial review of the F-1 visa termination are a final agency action and ripe for review.

Here's a breakdown of why:

### 1. Final Agency Action

For an agency action to be ""final"" under the APA (5 U.S.C. § 704), it generally must meet two conditions established in *Bennett v. Spear*, 520 U.S. 154 (1997):

1.  **The action must mark the consummation of the agency's decision-making process.** The agency must have completed its decision-making, and the action must not be merely tentative or interlocutory.
2.  **The action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.**

**Application to the Students' Case:**

*   **Consummation:** The letters terminating the students' F-1 status due to ""fraudulent enrollment"" clearly represent the consummation of the agency's decision-making process regarding their status. It's not a proposal, a draft, or an intermediate step; it's a definitive declaration that their status is terminated.
*   **Legal Consequences:** Significant legal consequences immediately flow from this termination:
    *   The students immediately lose their legal status in the U.S.
    *   They become unlawfully present, which can trigger future bars to re-entry (e.g., 3-year or 10-year bars).
    *   They are subject to arrest, detention, and removal proceedings.
    *   They cannot legally attend school.
    *   The ""fraudulent enrollment"" finding itself carries a severe stigma and can have long-lasting negative impacts on future immigration applications.

The availability of *subsequent* administrative remedies (like applying for reinstatement or defending in removal proceedings) does not necessarily negate the finality of the *initial* adverse action. The termination letter itself is the agency's definitive statement on their F-1 status.

### 2. Ripeness for Review

Ripeness is a doctrine designed to prevent courts from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and instead to ensure that judicial review occurs only when a controversy is fit for judicial decision. The Supreme Court's test in *Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner*, 387 U.S. 136 (1967), considers two factors:

1.  **The fitness of the issues for judicial decision:** Are the issues purely legal, or do they require further factual development?
2.  **The hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration:** What harm will the parties suffer if the court declines to hear the case now?

**Application to the Students' Case:**

*   **Fitness of the Issues:** The students are challenging the *legality* of the termination itself, alleging due process violations and that the government's finding of ""fraudulent enrollment"" is unlawful under the APA. These are primarily legal questions that do not require further factual development beyond the circumstances of the sham university and the termination letters. The core legal question is whether the government can terminate their status based on enrollment in a university it created as a sting operation.
*   **Hardship to the Parties:** The hardship to the students of withholding judicial review is severe and immediate:
    *   **Loss of Status and Unlawful Presence:** As noted above, they immediately lose their legal status and begin accruing unlawful presence, which has severe future immigration consequences.
    *   **Risk of Removal:** They are immediately subject to removal proceedings, which are adversarial and can result in deportation.
    *   **Stigma and Future Bars:** The ""fraudulent enrollment"" finding itself is a significant legal and practical impediment to any future immigration benefits.
    *   **Discretionary Nature of Reinstatement:** Applying for reinstatement is a discretionary process. It does not guarantee relief and, crucially, it does not allow the students to directly challenge the *legality* of the initial termination or the underlying ""fraudulent enrollment"" finding. It's asking for a new grant of status, not challenging the validity of the old one's termination.
    *   **Defensive Nature of Removal Proceedings:** While removal proceedings offer a forum, they are defensive in nature. The students would be fighting to avoid deportation *after* their status has been terminated and they have already suffered significant harm. They seek to prevent the government from *deeming* their enrollment fraudulent in the first place, which is a proactive challenge to the agency's initial determination.

**Conclusion:**

Given the immediate and severe legal consequences flowing from the termination letters, and the purely legal nature of the challenges to the agency's action and its underlying finding of ""fraudulent enrollment,"" the F-1 visa terminations likely constitute a **final agency action** and the claims are **ripe for judicial review**. The availability of discretionary reinstatement or defensive removal proceedings does not adequately address the immediate harm or the students' desire to challenge the fundamental legality of the government's initial action and its ""fraudulent enrollment"" finding. Many courts have found similar immigration actions to be final and ripe, especially when they carry such immediate and significant consequences.",[],,0.8351992964744568,14.674725888324875,24.940007614213215
"A Ukrainian national, paroled into the U.S. in 2022, brought an Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claim against USCIS for unlawfully charging a $410 filing fee for employment authorization.

Despite this, the court still dismissed the APA claim. What was the court's reasoning for dismissing the APA claim, and what alternative remedy did it identify as adequate?","The court dismissed the plaintiff's APA claim because she had an ""adequate remedy"" at law, which is an element of an APA cause of action under 5 U.S.C. § 704. The court found that a Tucker Act suit in the Court of Federal Claims or a Little Tucker Act suit in a federal district court would provide an adequate alternative remedy. These alternatives could offer the monetary relief (a refund) that the plaintiff sought and allow for review of the challenged agency action to the same extent as an APA case. The court reasoned that a monetary award would necessarily be predicated on a finding of legal error by the agency, effectively forcing the agency to cease its unlawful practice, making these alternatives adequate even if they didn't explicitly provide declaratory relief.",,,,,,,,"The court dismissed the plaintiff's APA claim because she had an ""adequate remedy"" at law, which is an element of an APA cause of action under 5 U.S.C. § 704.

These alternatives could offer the monetary relief (a refund) that the plaintiff sought and allow for review of the challenged agency action to the same extent as an APA case. The court reasoned that a monetary award would necessarily be predicated on a finding of legal error by the agency, effectively forcing the agency to cease its unlawful practice, making these alternatives adequate even if they didn't explicitly provide declaratory relief.","The court dismissed the APA claim based on the **""no other adequate remedy""** provision of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 704).

Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Reasoning for Dismissal of APA Claim:**
    The APA provides for judicial review of agency action only when there is ""no other adequate remedy in a court."" In this case, the plaintiff was primarily seeking a **monetary refund** of the $410 fee. The court determined that the APA is generally not the proper vehicle for purely monetary claims against the government, especially when another specific statutory scheme provides for such claims. While the APA can sometimes provide a basis for monetary relief incidental to other forms of relief, it is not designed as a general mechanism for recovering money from the U.S. Treasury.

2.  **Alternative Adequate Remedy Identified:**
    The court identified the **Little Tucker Act** (28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2)) as the adequate alternative remedy.
    *   The Little Tucker Act grants U.S. District Courts jurisdiction over claims against the United States not exceeding $10,000, ""founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.""
    *   Since the plaintiff's claim for a refund of an unlawfully charged fee was ""founded upon an Act of Congress"" (the Ukrainian Parolee Act), it fell squarely within the jurisdictional grant of the Little Tucker Act. This provided an adequate avenue for the plaintiff to pursue her monetary refund claim, thereby precluding the use of the APA for that specific relief.",[],,0.8468528985977173,13.594097744360905,37.08094611528824
"Can a noncitizen residing outside the U.S. successfully sue the government for unreasonable delay in processing a worker's visa application, citing violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause, when the delay is primarily attributed to a global pandemic and the applicant seeks initial entry?","No. The court dismissed the claims, finding that some defendants (USCIS, its Director, and the Secretary of State) were moot because they lacked the authority to provide the requested relief.

Applying the TRAC factors, the court noted that Congress sets no statutory deadline for visa processing, the prejudice alleged was primarily financial rather than health-related, and expediting the applicant's case would merely reorder the queue without net gain. Concerning the Due Process claim, the court held that a noncitizen seeking initial admission to the United States has no constitutional rights under the Due Process Clause regarding their application, as the power to admit or exclude noncitizens is a sovereign prerogative and their only procedural rights are those conferred by statute.",,,,,,,,"No. The court dismissed the claims, finding that some defendants (USCIS, its Director, and the Secretary of State) were moot because they lacked the authority to provide the requested relief.

Here's a breakdown of the legal challenges:

1.  **Due Process Clause (Fifth Amendment):**
    *   **No Constitutional Right to Entry:** U.S. courts have consistently held that noncitizens residing outside the U.S. seeking initial entry do not have a constitutional right to enter the United States. The power to admit or exclude aliens is a fundamental attribute of national sovereignty.
    *   **No Protected Liberty or Property Interest:** Because there is no constitutional right to enter, there is generally no ""liberty"" or ""property"" interest protected by the Due Process Clause for an alien seeking an initial visa from abroad. A visa is considered a privilege, not a right. Therefore, a claim that the government violated due process by delaying a visa application for initial entry would almost certainly fail.

2.  **Administrative Procedure Act (APA):**
    *   **Consular Nonreviewability Doctrine:** This is the most significant hurdle. U.S. courts generally lack jurisdiction to review the decisions of consular officers abroad regarding visa issuance or denial. This doctrine stems from the principle that visa decisions are discretionary foreign policy matters. While there are *very narrow* exceptions (e.g., where a consular officer acts without statutory authority or against a clear statutory mandate), a delay in processing, even if lengthy, typically falls within the realm of discretionary consular functions.
    *   **""Unreasonably Delayed"" Agency Action (5 U.S.C. § 706(1)):** The APA allows courts to ""compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed."" While this provision *could* theoretically apply to visa processing, several factors make success improbable in this scenario:
        *   **Lack of Statutory Deadline:** There are generally no statutory deadlines for processing most visa applications. Courts are reluctant to impose deadlines where Congress has not.
        *   **Discretionary Nature:** Visa issuance is largely discretionary. Courts are hesitant to compel action in discretionary matters, especially when it involves foreign policy and national security considerations.
        *   **The Pandemic as a Justification:** The fact that the delay is primarily attributed to a global pandemic provides a strong defense for the government. Courts are likely to view such delays as reasonable given the extraordinary circumstances, resource constraints, and public health measures that impacted government operations worldwide. Agencies are generally afforded deference in managing their resources, especially during crises.
        *   **Lack of ""Final Agency Action"":** While the APA allows for compelling *delayed* action, the consular nonreviewability doctrine often prevents courts from even reaching the merits of whether the delay is unreasonable for initial visa applications.
        *   **Standing:** While the applicant is clearly ""aggrieved,"" the lack of a legal right to the visa (as discussed under Due Process) can also weaken standing arguments under the APA, which requires being ""adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute.""

**In summary:**

*   **Due Process:** Fails because noncitizens outside the U.S. seeking initial entry have no constitutional right to a visa or entry, and thus no protected liberty or property interest.
*   **APA:** Faces significant challenges due to the consular nonreviewability doctrine, the discretionary nature of visa processing, and the strong justification for delays caused by a global pandemic. While the APA allows for compelling ""unreasonably delayed"" action, the specific context of an initial visa application from abroad makes it an extremely difficult case to win.

Courts are generally unwilling to second-guess the Executive Branch's decisions regarding who may enter the country, especially when those decisions are made by consular officers abroad and are impacted by global events.",[],,0.8253398537635803,14.867078309981537,22.60144183773218
"Under what circumstances will a U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia transfer a case challenging a USCIS visa denial to another district, particularly when the plaintiff chose the D.C. forum but the administrative decision was made elsewhere?","A U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia will transfer a case challenging a USCIS visa denial to another district, such as the District of Nebraska, when the balance of private and public interest factors strongly favors the transferee forum. In such cases, the court will grant a motion to transfer pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), concluding that the case ""might have been brought"" in the transferee court and that transfer is ""in the interest of justice.""

Specifically, the court considers:
1.  **Propriety of Venue in Transferee Court:** Venue is proper in the transferee court if, under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e), a defendant resides there, a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred there, or the plaintiff resides there. For cases challenging USCIS decisions, venue is typically proper in the district where the relevant service center (e.g., Nebraska Service Center) is located and processed the petition, or where the plaintiff resides.
2.  **Balancing of Private Interest Factors:**
    *   **Plaintiff's Choice of Forum:** The deference given to the plaintiff's choice of forum is significantly reduced when it is not the plaintiff's home forum and lacks meaningful ties to the controversy. If the administrative decision being challenged was made in another district, the D.C. court will give ""nadir"" deference to the plaintiff's choice to sue in D.C.
    *   **Defendant's Choice of Forum:** This choice gains some deference, especially when the defendants seek transfer to the plaintiff's home forum or where the claim arose.
    *   **Where the Claim Arose:** This is a predominant factor. In Administrative Procedure Act (APA) cases challenging agency action, the claim generally arises where the decision-making process occurred. If the visa petition was processed, adjudicated, and denied by a USCIS service center in another district (e.g., Nebraska), then the claim arose in that district, not D.C., even if general agency policies were formulated in D.C., unless there are credible allegations of direct, case-specific involvement by D.C.-based officials.
    *   **Convenience of Parties, Witnesses, and Access to Proof:** Convenience factors typically favor the district where the plaintiff resides (if applicable) or, more strongly, the district where the administrative record is located and where the agency personnel involved in the challenged decision reside, as APA cases are generally resolved on the administrative record.
3.  **Balancing of Public Interest Factors:**
    *   **Familiarity with Governing Laws:** This factor is neutral for federal law cases as all federal courts are presumed equally familiar.
    *   **Relative Congestion of Calendars:** While current statistics might slightly favor D.C. in terms of caseload, this factor is often a ""wash"" due to the difficulty of accurate assessment and the concern about future congestion if D.C. retains cases with little connection to the district.

While the plaintiff's choice of forum is generally given significant weight, especially if D.C. is a proper venue (which it often is for federal agency actions under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)), the court will balance several factors. The burden is on the party seeking transfer (usually the government) to demonstrate that the balance of these factors strongly favors transfer.

Here are the circumstances and factors the D.C. court would consider:

1.  **Convenience of Parties:**
    *   **Plaintiff's Residence:** If the plaintiff resides in a district far from D.C., and has no connection to D.C., this factor might weigh in favor of transfer to their home district.
    *   **Government's Location:** While the ultimate defendant (the U.S. government) is headquartered in D.C., the specific USCIS personnel involved in the decision-making process (e.g., at a service center in California, a field office in Texas, or a consulate abroad) might be located elsewhere. The government might argue it's more convenient for its personnel and attorneys to litigate in that other district.

2.  **Convenience of Witnesses:**
    *   **Nature of the Case (APA Review):** Most challenges to visa denials are brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), meaning the court's review is limited to the administrative record. In such cases, live testimony from witnesses is rare, and the ""convenience of witnesses"" factor often carries little weight. The administrative record is typically electronic and accessible from any district.
    *   **Cases Requiring Discovery/Testimony:** If the case involves claims that go beyond the administrative record (e.g., allegations of bad faith, constitutional violations, or claims requiring discovery into agency procedures or motivations), then the location of potential witnesses (USCIS officers, plaintiff, third parties) becomes much more relevant. If all such witnesses are outside D.C., this factor would strongly favor transfer.

3.  **Interest of Justice:**
    *   **Location of the Administrative Decision:** The fact that the administrative decision was made elsewhere (e.g., a USCIS service center, a consulate, or a field office) is a primary argument the government will make. They will contend that the relevant ""events"" occurred in that other district.
    *   **Access to Sources of Proof:** As noted, for APA review, the record is usually electronic. If there are physical documents or other evidence not part of the electronic record, their location could be a factor.
    *   **Docket Congestion:** While D.C. is a busy court, this factor alone is rarely determinative.
    *   **Local Interest:** If the case has a strong local interest in another district (e.g., a large number of affected individuals in a specific community), this could be a minor factor.
    *   **Familiarity with State Law:** This is generally not relevant for federal visa denials, which are governed by federal law.

**Key Considerations and Likelihood:**

*   **Plaintiff's Choice:** The D.C. court will give substantial deference to the plaintiff's choice of forum, especially if D.C. is a proper venue for the action. The government must make a strong showing that the balance of factors *overwhelmingly* favors transfer.
*   **Nature of APA Review:** In a typical APA challenge to a visa denial, where review is limited to the administrative record, the arguments for transfer based on ""convenience of witnesses"" are often weak. The primary argument for transfer usually boils down to the convenience of the government's personnel and the location where the decision was made.
*   **No Connection to D.C.:** If the plaintiff has absolutely no connection to D.C., the visa application was processed entirely outside D.C., and the government can articulate specific reasons why litigating in the other district would be significantly more convenient (e.g., for specific agency personnel who might be deposed if the case goes beyond record review), then transfer becomes more likely.

In summary, a D.C. District Court is most likely to transfer a visa denial case when:
1.  The plaintiff has no meaningful connection to D.C.
2.  The administrative decision was made entirely outside D.C.
3.  The government can demonstrate a compelling reason that the convenience of parties and witnesses (especially if the case is likely to involve discovery or testimony beyond the administrative record) and the interest of justice strongly favor litigation in another specific district, *despite* the plaintiff's initial choice of the D.C. forum.

However, for a straightforward APA review of a visa denial, where the record is electronic and no live testimony is anticipated, the D.C. court will often retain the case, respecting the plaintiff's choice of forum.",[],,0.8818498849868774,10.910623342175068,42.66498010610081
"Apex Construction Inc. hired several new employees. For some, the employees signed Section 1 of the I-9 Form but failed to check the box indicating their specific work authorization status (e.g., U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident). For others, Apex completed Section 2 but failed to list the issuing authority for a driver's license presented as proof of identity. Apex had photocopied all identity and work authorization documents and kept them in a separate folder, believing that the copies, combined with the employee's signature, fulfilled its obligations. During an ICE inspection, these issues were flagged. Apex later produced the copied documents during the administrative hearing, arguing they cured the I-9 deficiencies and showed good faith. Apex now faces civil penalties. Based on the *Ketchikan Drywall Services* decision, how should a court evaluate Apex Construction Inc.'s arguments regarding its I-9 compliance, the nature of its violations, and the potential for penalty mitigation?","Based on the *Ketchikan Drywall Services* decision, Apex Construction Inc.'s arguments would likely be rejected, and the penalties upheld. The court would find that employers must fully complete I-9 Forms, and merely copying and retaining verification documents is neither necessary nor sufficient for compliance, nor does it relieve the employer of the requirement to fully complete Section 2. The regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 274a.2(b)(3), clarifies that copying and retention do not relieve the employer from fully completing Section 2, superseding any prior interpretations to the contrary.

Regarding the specific violations:
1.  **Failure to check a specific box in Section 1:** This is considered a ""substantive"" verification failure under the Virtue Memorandum (which the court grants Skidmore deference). Employees are required to attest to a specific category of eligibility, and failure to check the appropriate box means the statutory requirement (8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(2)) is unfulfilled, regardless of whether other documentation might allow ICE to deduce the employee's status. Employers are responsible for ensuring Section 1 is completely filled out by employees.
2.  **Failure to list the issuing authority for a List B document (e.g., driver's license) in Section 2:** This is a substantive failure. Employers have an obligation to fill out Section 2 of their I-9 Forms ""fully,"" and the absence of the issuing authority constitutes a failure to identify the document utilized, even if ICE might deduce the information from other details.

The court would likely find that the late production of copied documents during the administrative hearing cannot cure substantive deficiencies. The Virtue Memorandum only excuses certain substantive deficiencies where the missing information is found ""on a legible copy of a document retained *with* the Form I-9 and *presented at the I-9 inspection*."" Documents not presented at the initial I-9 inspection do not qualify. The penalties are imposed for substantive deficiencies on the I-9 Forms themselves, not for the manner or timing of document storage or production.

Finally, concerning penalty mitigation, the ALJ has broad discretion. A refusal to mitigate for ""good faith"" would be permissible if, for example, Apex had a history of non-compliance or demonstrated a lack of timely effort to ascertain and conform to the law.

Similarly, a refusal to mitigate for ""non-seriousness"" would be upheld, as the penalties are for substantive deficiencies in the I-9 Forms.","Based on the *Ketchikan Drywall Services* decision, a court would likely evaluate Apex Construction Inc.'s arguments as follows:

1.  **Nature of the Violations (Substantive vs. Technical):**
    *   ***Ketchikan Drywall Services*** **Distinction:** The *Ketchikan* decision established a critical distinction between ""substantive"" and ""technical"" I-9 violations.
        *   **Substantive violations** are those that fundamentally undermine the purpose of the I-9 process – verifying identity and employment authorization. These are generally *not curable* after an inspection and lead to penalties. Examples include failing to complete a section, failing to sign, or failing to present any documents.
        *   **Technical violations** are minor errors that do not prevent the government from determining whether the employee is authorized to work. These *can be cured* within 10 business days of notification by ICE, provided the employer acted in good faith.
    *   **Apex's Section 1 Violation (Failure to check work authorization box):** This is highly likely to be considered a **substantive violation**. The employee's attestation of their work authorization status is a core component of Section 1. Failing to check the box means the employee has not fully attested to their status, which directly impacts the verification of their eligibility to work. It's not a minor transcription error; it's a missing piece of the required attestation.
    *   **Apex's Section 2 Violation (Failure to list issuing authority for driver's license):** This is also likely to be considered a **substantive violation**. Section 2 requires the employer to record specific information about the documents presented, including the issuing authority. This detail is crucial for verifying the authenticity and validity of the document. Its omission makes it difficult to confirm that the employer properly examined a legitimate document.

2.  **Apex's Argument Regarding Photocopies and ""Curing"" Deficiencies:**
    *   ***Ketchikan* on Photocopies:** The *Ketchikan* decision, consistent with I-9 regulations, clarifies that **photocopies of documents do not substitute for proper completion of the I-9 Form itself.** While retaining copies is a best practice, it does not cure deficiencies on the form. The form must be accurately and completely filled out. Apex's belief that copies ""fulfilled its obligations"" is a misunderstanding of I-9 compliance.
    *   ***Ketchikan* on Timely Curing:** For technical violations to be curable, they must be corrected **within 10 business days of notification by ICE**. Apex produced the copied documents and argued they cured deficiencies *during the administrative hearing*, which occurs long after the initial ICE inspection and notification. This is far too late to be considered a timely cure under *Ketchikan* standards. For substantive violations, there is no post-inspection cure.

3.  **Apex's Argument Regarding ""Good Faith"" and Penalty Mitigation:**
    *   ***Ketchikan* on Good Faith:** Good faith is a critical factor, particularly for technical violations to be curable and for mitigating penalties. However, *Ketchikan* emphasizes that good faith requires diligent efforts to comply.
    *   **Evaluation for Apex:**
        *   While Apex's act of photocopying documents might suggest an *intent* to comply, the *nature* of its errors (missing core information in both Section 1 and Section 2) indicates a significant lack of diligence in completing the I-9 forms correctly.
        *   The failure to timely cure the deficiencies further undermines a claim of good faith *regarding compliance*.
        *   A court would likely find that Apex's errors were not minor technicalities but rather substantive omissions that prevented proper verification. Therefore, even if Apex genuinely believed it was complying, its actions would not meet the standard for good faith that would allow these specific violations to be cured or dismissed.
        *   Good faith *might* still be considered by the court in determining the *amount* of the civil penalties, potentially leading to a lower penalty within the statutory range, but it would not eliminate the penalties for these substantive or untimelily cured violations.

**Conclusion:**

A court, applying the principles from *Ketchikan Drywall Services*, would likely find that Apex Construction Inc.'s violations are **substantive** in nature. The failure to check the work authorization box in Section 1 and the omission of the issuing authority in Section 2 are not minor errors but fundamental gaps in the I-9 process. Apex's reliance on photocopies as a substitute for proper form completion is invalid, and its attempt to ""cure"" the deficiencies at an administrative hearing is far too late to be effective. While Apex might argue good faith, the nature of the violations and the failure to timely correct them would likely lead the court to uphold civil penalties, though the degree of good faith might influence the final penalty amount.",[],,0.8552718758583069,14.280104065284121,27.437094033091313

The denial of the Convention Against Torture (CAT) claim would be upheld if the petitioner forfeited other arguments by not briefing them and the BIA's deliberation was deemed sufficient.","A U.S. Court of Appeals would likely **not uphold** the BIA's denial of asylum and withholding of removal in this scenario. The BIA's decision appears to contain several significant legal errors and factual findings that are not supported by substantial evidence, making it vulnerable to reversal or remand by a Circuit Court.

Here's a breakdown of why:

1.  **Past Persecution - ""Not Extreme"" Injuries:**
    *   **Legal Error:** The BIA's finding that the injuries were ""not extreme"" enough to constitute past persecution is a misapplication of the law. Persecution does not require ""extreme"" injuries. Repeated arrests, beatings, credible death threats, and the disappearance of fellow detainees are widely recognized as forms of persecution. The standard is whether the harm inflicted rises to the level of persecution, not whether it meets an arbitrary ""extreme"" threshold. This would likely be reviewed *de novo* as a legal interpretation.

2.  **Nexus to a Protected Ground:**
    *   **Factual Error/Failure to Consider Evidence:** The BIA's finding that the military targeted the nurse due to his occupation, not political opinion, appears to ignore crucial facts. The claim explicitly states ""past persecution based on an imputed political opinion (assisting separatists) and Anglophone ethnicity."" If the military targeted him *as a nurse* because they *imputed* a political opinion to him (i.e., believed he was assisting separatists by providing medical care, regardless of his intent) or because of his Anglophone ethnicity in a conflict zone, then a nexus *does* exist. The BIA cannot simply dismiss the imputed political opinion and ethnicity claims without a thorough analysis of how these factors intersected with his occupation. This finding would be reviewed under the *substantial evidence* standard, and the BIA's conclusion seems to lack such support given the stated facts.

3.  **Insufficient Corroborating Evidence:**
    *   **Legal Error/Abuse of Discretion:** The BIA's demand for specific types of corroboration (photos/medical records) despite the nurse's credible explanation for their absence (common in war-torn regions) and the submission of alternative evidence (affidavits) is problematic. The BIA cannot demand corroboration that is reasonably unavailable. If the applicant's testimony is credible, it can be sufficient to establish a claim. The BIA must consider the totality of the evidence and cannot make an adverse credibility finding solely based on the lack of corroboration if the applicant has provided a reasonable explanation. This could be seen as an abuse of discretion or a failure to apply the correct legal standard regarding corroboration.

4.  **Fear of Future Persecution - Changed Country Conditions:**
    *   **Lack of Substantial Evidence:** The BIA's reliance on a government exhibit to find changed country conditions, while ignoring the *contradictory evidence of continued atrocities* within that very same exhibit, is a clear failure to meet the *substantial evidence* standard. The BIA cannot selectively cite evidence to support its conclusion while disregarding evidence that undermines it. A Court of Appeals would likely find that the BIA's conclusion regarding changed country conditions is not supported by the record as a whole.

**Conclusion:**

Given these multiple potential errors, a U.S. Court of Appeals would likely **vacate** the BIA's decision and **remand** the case for further proceedings consistent with the correct legal standards. The BIA would be instructed to:
*   Apply the correct legal standard for ""persecution.""
*   Properly analyze the nexus between the harm suffered and the protected grounds (imputed political opinion and Anglophone ethnicity).
*   Evaluate the corroborating evidence in light of the applicant's explanation for missing documents and the submitted affidavits.
*   Consider all relevant evidence regarding country conditions, not just selectively cited portions.

The cumulative effect of these errors strongly suggests that the BIA's denial was not based on a reasoned application of the law to the facts.",[],,0.8365491032600403,14.848390035751358,25.33476588628764
"An organization applies for recognition to provide low-cost immigration legal services.

Here's why:

1.  **Lack of Official Nonprofit Status:** This is a fundamental and non-negotiable requirement for an organization to be recognized to provide immigration legal services. The regulations explicitly state that only ""nonprofit religious, charitable, social service, or similar organizations"" are eligible. Without official nonprofit status (e.g., 501(c)(3) IRS designation), the organization does not meet the threshold eligibility criteria.

2.  **Severe Conflicts of Interest and Undue Influence:** The shared physical location, officers, and directors with a for-profit company that *also* provides immigration services creates an unacceptable conflict of interest. The BIA's regulations are designed to ensure that recognized organizations provide services for humanitarian and public good purposes, free from pecuniary interests. Sharing governance and operational aspects with a for-profit entity, especially one in the same service area, directly undermines this principle and raises serious concerns about:
    *   **Client Referrals:** The potential for the ""nonprofit"" to funnel clients to the for-profit entity.
    *   **Decision-Making:** The for-profit's financial interests influencing the ""nonprofit's"" policies, fees, or service delivery.
    *   **Ethical Breaches:** The appearance of impropriety and the inability to clearly distinguish between the two entities in the eyes of vulnerable clients.

3.  **DHS Recommendation:** The Department of Homeland Security's recommendation against approval, citing these specific concerns, carries significant weight. DHS is responsible for initial vetting and its findings regarding the lack of nonprofit status and potential for undue influence are critical.

The BIA's primary goal in granting recognition is to protect the public and ensure that individuals seeking immigration assistance receive ethical, competent, and affordable services from organizations whose primary motive is service, not profit. This scenario presents multiple red flags that directly contradict the spirit and letter of the recognition regulations.",[],,0.8386462926864624,17.319467576791812,5.681704209328814
"If an immigration applicant's testimony is deemed not credible by an Immigration Judge (IJ) and affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), but the applicant has submitted extensive non-testimonial country conditions evidence to support a claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), can the BIA deny the CAT claim by stating the claim is based solely on the not-credible testimony and that the applicant points to no other objective evidence?","No, the BIA cannot deny a CAT claim by stating that it is based solely on not-credible testimony and that the applicant points to no other objective evidence, when the applicant has submitted non-testimonial country conditions evidence. CAT claims are distinct from asylum and withholding-of-removal claims and require separate analytical attention. The BIA is required to consider country conditions evidence in its likelihood-of-torture assessment, and this requirement has no exception for cases of adverse credibility determinations. When an applicant offers non-testimonial evidence that could independently establish eligibility for CAT relief, an adverse credibility finding alone cannot defeat the claim. Failure to consider such evidence, or appearing to deny its existence in the record, is an error requiring remand for further consideration.",,,,,,,,"No, the BIA cannot deny a CAT claim by stating that it is based solely on not-credible testimony and that the applicant points to no other objective evidence, when the applicant has submitted non-testimonial country conditions evidence.

Failure to consider such evidence, or appearing to deny its existence in the record, is an error requiring remand for further consideration.","No, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) generally **cannot** deny a claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) by stating it is based *solely* on not-credible testimony and that the applicant points to no other objective evidence, if the applicant has in fact submitted extensive non-testimonial country conditions evidence.

Here's why:

1.  **Duty to Consider All Evidence:** The BIA, like the Immigration Judge (IJ), has a duty to consider all evidence submitted by an applicant. Simply ignoring or mischaracterizing the existence of ""extensive non-testimonial country conditions evidence"" would be an error of law and fact.

2.  **CAT Standard vs. Asylum/Withholding:**
    *   While an applicant's credible testimony is often crucial for asylum and withholding of removal claims (which typically require the applicant to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution *on account of* a protected ground), the standard for CAT is different.
    *   CAT requires the applicant to show it is ""more likely than not"" (i.e., a probability greater than 50%) that they would be tortured if removed to the country in question.
    *   Crucially, CAT does *not* require the torture to be ""on account of"" a protected ground, nor does it require the applicant to establish past torture. It focuses on the *future risk* of torture by or with the acquiescence of a public official or person acting in an official capacity.

3.  **Role of Non-Testimonial Evidence in CAT:**
    *   Even if an applicant's personal testimony is deemed not credible, extensive country conditions evidence can independently establish a CAT claim. This evidence can demonstrate:
        *   Widespread torture in the country.
        *   Specific groups or individuals who are routinely targeted for torture (e.g., returned deportees, political dissidents, certain ethnic groups).
        *   The involvement or acquiescence of government officials in such torture.
    *   In such cases, the country conditions evidence might be so compelling that it establishes a ""more likely than not"" risk of torture for the applicant, even if the IJ/BIA doesn't believe the applicant's specific personal account of *why* they would be targeted. The country conditions might show that *anyone* in the applicant's general situation (e.g., a returned national) faces a high risk.

4.  **BIA's Requirement to Articulate Reasoning:**
    *   If the BIA denies the CAT claim, it must articulate its reasoning and demonstrate that it has considered all relevant evidence. If the BIA states that the claim is based *solely* on not-credible testimony and that there is *no other objective evidence*, when extensive non-testimonial evidence was submitted, this would be a mischaracterization of the record.
    *   Such a mischaracterization or failure to engage with the submitted evidence would likely be grounds for a federal circuit court to vacate the BIA's decision and remand the case for proper consideration.

**In summary:** While a lack of credible testimony significantly weakens an applicant's case, especially for asylum, it is not automatically fatal to a CAT claim if substantial, relevant country conditions evidence has been submitted. The BIA must consider and engage with *all* evidence presented, and cannot simply dismiss a CAT claim by ignoring or misrepresenting the existence of non-testimonial evidence.",[],,0.846367359161377,14.683071083505869,28.821832298136684
"An individual has legally resided in the U.S. for years, is married to an H-1B visa holder with a pending green card application, and has her H-4 nonimmigrant status and Employment Authorization Document (EAD) renewal applications pending with USCIS.

1.  **Rule of Reason:** USCIS's ""first-in, first-out"" processing system was considered a rule of reason, favoring defendants.
2.  **Congressional Timetable:** While 8 U.S.C. § 1571(b) suggests processing within 180 days (six months), the plaintiff's applications had been pending for less than four months when the decision was made, so this factor favored defendants *for the moment*.

Here's an analysis based on the *TRAC* factors and the preliminary injunction standard:

**I. Preliminary Injunction Standard**

To obtain a preliminary injunction, the plaintiff generally must demonstrate:
1.  **Likelihood of success on the merits:** That she is likely to prevail on her underlying claim (here, that USCIS's delay is unreasonable).
2.  **Irreparable harm:** That she will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.
3.  **Balance of equities:** That the balance of hardships tips in her favor.
4.  **Public interest:** That an injunction is in the public interest.

The *TRAC* factors are central to establishing the ""likelihood of success on the merits"" for an unreasonable delay claim.

**II. Application of *TRAC* Factors (Likelihood of Success on the Merits)**

The six *TRAC* factors (from *Telecommunications Research & Action Center v. FCC*, 750 F.2d 70 (D.C. Cir. 1984)) are:

1.  **The time agencies take to make decisions must be governed by a ""rule of reason.""**
    *   **Analysis:** The fact that her EAD *renewal* has expired due to USCIS processing delays, causing her to lose her job and driver's license, strongly suggests the delay is unreasonable. Renewals are typically expected to be processed in a timely manner to ensure continuity, especially when the underlying status (H-4) is maintained and the green card application is pending. The delay has gone beyond mere inconvenience to severe disruption.

2.  **Where Congress has provided a timetable or other statutory deadline for agency action, that timetable must be observed.**
    *   **Analysis:** There are generally no specific statutory deadlines for USCIS to adjudicate H-4 or EAD applications. This factor typically weighs against the plaintiff in such cases, or at least neutrally.

3.  **Hardship to the petitioner by reason of the delay.**
    *   **Analysis:** This is the **strongest factor in her favor**. She has suffered significant and concrete hardship:
        *   **Loss of employment:** Direct financial harm, loss of livelihood, and potential impact on her family's financial stability.
        *   **Loss of driver's license:** Severely impacts daily life, mobility, ability to perform essential tasks, and potentially future employment opportunities.
        *   These constitute ""aggravating circumstances"" and ""serious prejudice"" that courts often find compelling.

4.  **The effect of expediting delayed action on agency activities of a higher or competing priority.**
    *   **Analysis:** USCIS often argues that expediting one case would delay others. While this is a legitimate concern, courts balance it against the severity of the individual hardship. When the hardship is as severe as losing a job and driver's license due to agency inaction on a *renewal*, the balance often tips towards the individual, especially since the H-4 EAD program was specifically designed to allow these individuals to work.

5.  **The extent to which agency delay is attributable to causes beyond the agency's control.**
    *   **Analysis:** USCIS frequently cites backlogs and resource constraints. However, courts are increasingly scrutinizing these explanations, especially when delays become systemic and lead to severe individual hardship. The agency has a responsibility to manage its workload and resources to prevent such outcomes for renewals.

6.  **The public interest in expediting resolution of the dispute.**
    *   **Analysis:** There is a strong public interest in ensuring that government agencies act reasonably and do not cause severe hardship to individuals through undue delay, particularly when those individuals are legally residing and working in the U.S. and following all procedures. It also upholds the integrity of the immigration system and the intent behind programs like the H-4 EAD.

**III. Conclusion on Likelihood of Success on the Merits**

Despite the lack of a statutory deadline (Factor 2), the severe and concrete hardship suffered by the individual (Factor 3 – loss of job, loss of driver's license) due to the unreasonable delay in processing a *renewal* application (Factor 1) makes a very strong case for success on the merits. Courts are generally sympathetic to such direct and significant prejudice caused by agency inaction.

**IV. Other Preliminary Injunction Factors**

*   **Irreparable Harm:** The loss of a job, income, and driver's license constitutes irreparable harm. While income can be quantified, the *ability to earn it* and the cascading effects on one's life, stability, and dignity are often considered irreparable, especially when the delay is ongoing and the individual cannot mitigate the harm without agency action.
*   **Balance of Equities:** The harm to the individual (loss of livelihood, mobility, stability) far outweighs the harm to USCIS (being compelled to prioritize one application, which is a routine administrative task).
*   **Public Interest:** The public interest favors compelling government agencies to act reasonably and prevent severe hardship to individuals who are legally present and following immigration procedures.

**Overall Conclusion:**

Given the severe and direct prejudice suffered by the individual (loss of job, driver's license) due to USCIS's delay in processing her H-4 and EAD *renewal* applications, she has a strong likelihood of succeeding on the merits of her unreasonable delay claim under the *TRAC* factors. This strong showing, combined with the clear irreparable harm, favorable balance of equities, and public interest, makes it **highly likely** that a court would grant her a preliminary injunction to compel USCIS to immediately adjudicate her applications.",[],,0.841576099395752,13.974663299663302,29.845757575757602
"A 17-year-old from Honduras, initially ordered removed, re-enters the U.S. alone and is categorized as an unaccompanied minor. He then files a motion to reopen his prior removal proceedings, arguing that he should have been placed in mandatory TVPRA proceedings and that newly available evidence concerning his sexual orientation makes him eligible for asylum.

Additionally, the BIA failed to address whether the new evidence concerning the petitioner's sexual orientation and experiences with threats of violence in Honduras was previously unavailable and material for asylum eligibility, as required for a motion to reopen.","This 17-year-old from Honduras has significant recourse in federal court, and the likely outcome is a remand to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) for proper consideration of his arguments.

### Recourse in Federal Court

His primary recourse is to file a **Petition for Review (PFR)** with the appropriate **U.S. Court of Appeals**. This petition would challenge the BIA's denial of his motion to reopen.

The grounds for his petition would likely include:

1.  **Abuse of Discretion:** The BIA's denial of a motion to reopen is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion occurs if the BIA's decision is arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law. Failing to address a non-frivolous legal argument or inadequately considering material evidence would fall under this standard.
2.  **Legal Error:** The BIA's failure to substantively address the TVPRA argument could constitute a legal error, as the TVPRA sets forth specific, mandatory procedures for unaccompanied alien children. The court reviews questions of law *de novo* (without deference to the BIA).
3.  **Due Process Violation:** By failing to adequately consider his arguments and evidence, the BIA may have deprived him of a meaningful opportunity to present his case, potentially violating his right to due process under the Fifth Amendment.

### Likely Outcome

Given the facts presented, the **likely outcome is a remand of the case to the BIA** for further proceedings. Here's why:

1.  **Failure to Address TVPRA Argument:**
    *   **Significance:** The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) provides specific protections and procedures for unaccompanied alien children (UACs), including a presumption that they are not immediately removable and a requirement for a full hearing before an immigration judge. If he should have been placed in mandatory TVPRA proceedings, his prior removal order might be procedurally invalid or subject to different standards.
    *   **BIA's Error:** The BIA's failure to ""substantively address"" this argument is a significant legal error and an abuse of discretion. The BIA is required to provide a reasoned explanation for its decisions and to address all non-frivolous arguments raised by the petitioner.
    *   **Court's Action:** The Court of Appeals would likely find that the BIA erred by not addressing a critical legal argument concerning the proper procedural framework for a UAC. It would almost certainly **remand the case to the BIA** with instructions to properly consider whether the TVPRA applies to his situation and, if so, what impact it has on his prior removal order and eligibility for relief.

2.  **Inadequate Consideration of New Evidence (Sexual Orientation/Asylum):**
    *   **Significance:** Sexual orientation is a recognized basis for a ""particular social group"" asylum claim. For a 17-year-old, it is entirely plausible that his sexual orientation was not fully realized or safely disclosed during prior proceedings, making it ""newly available"" and ""material"" to an asylum claim.
    *   **BIA's Error:** The BIA's failure to ""adequately consider the new evidence's availability and materiality"" is an abuse of discretion. When a motion to reopen is based on new evidence, the BIA must assess whether the evidence is truly new, material, and could not have been discovered or presented earlier. It must also determine if the new evidence, if true, would establish *prima facie* eligibility for the requested relief (asylum in this case). A perfunctory or unreasoned denial on these grounds is an abuse of discretion.
    *   **Court's Action:** The Court of Appeals would likely find that the BIA abused its discretion by not properly evaluating the new evidence. It would **remand the case to the BIA** with instructions to thoroughly assess the availability and materiality of the evidence concerning his sexual orientation and to determine if it establishes *prima facie* eligibility for asylum.

**In summary:** The federal court is highly likely to find that the BIA's decision was an abuse of discretion and/or contained legal errors due to its failure to properly address the TVPRA argument and its inadequate consideration of the new evidence. The most probable outcome is that the Court of Appeals will **grant the Petition for Review and remand the case to the BIA** for a full and reasoned consideration of both the TVPRA applicability and the merits of his asylum claim based on his sexual orientation. This would give the 11-year-old another opportunity to present his case before the immigration authorities.",[],,0.8401618003845215,15.121892703862663,28.14601502145925

Therefore, both private interest factors (plaintiff's chosen forum deference weakened, convenience of parties/witnesses, ease of access to proof) and public interest factors (local interest in deciding controversies at home) favored transferring the case to the District of Nebraska.","A federal court in the District of Columbia can transfer a civil action challenging a federal agency's decision to another district, such as Nebraska or North Dakota, primarily under the provisions of **28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)**. This statute allows for transfer ""for the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice,"" to any other district or division ""where it might have been brought"" or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.

Here are the specific circumstances and factors a D.C. federal court would consider:

1.  **Where the Action ""Might Have Been Brought"" (Proper Venue):**
    *   The first hurdle is to establish that the case *could have been filed originally* in the proposed transferee district (e.g., Nebraska or North Dakota). For actions against federal agencies, venue is governed by **28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)**, which states that a civil action in which a defendant is an officer or employee of the United States acting in an official capacity or an agency of the United States may be brought in any judicial district in which:
        *   **(1) a defendant in the action resides,**
        *   **(2) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated, or**
        *   **(3) the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action.**
    *   **Application:** If the federal agency's decision primarily impacts a specific geographic area (e.g., an environmental permit for a project in Nebraska, a land use decision affecting property in North Dakota), or if the plaintiff (or a significant number of plaintiffs) resides in that district, then venue could likely have been proper there under § 1391(e)(2) or (3).

2.  **Convenience of Parties and Witnesses:**
    *   **Parties:** The court will consider the residence of the plaintiff(s) and any intervenors. While the federal agency (defendant) typically has counsel in D.C., its local field office personnel or specific decision-makers might be located in the proposed transferee district.
    *   **Witnesses:** This is often a critical factor. If key non-party witnesses (e.g., local residents, state or local officials, experts familiar with local conditions, individuals directly affected by the agency's decision) reside in Nebraska or North Dakota, and compelling their attendance or taking their depositions would be significantly easier there, this factor weighs heavily in favor of transfer.

3.  **Interest of Justice:** This is a broad category encompassing various factors that promote judicial economy, fairness, and efficient litigation.
    *   **Local Interest in the Controversy:** If the agency's decision has a significant local impact (e.g., affecting a specific community, natural resource, or industry in Nebraska or North Dakota), there is a strong ""local interest"" in having the case heard in that district.
    *   **Access to Evidence:** The location of physical evidence, documents, or sites relevant to the dispute (e.g., the project site, affected property, local environmental data) can favor transfer.
    *   **Familiarity with Governing Law:** While federal law is paramount, if the case involves complex interactions with state or local laws specific to Nebraska or North Dakota, a court in that district might have greater familiarity.
    *   **Court Congestion:** While D.C. courts are busy, this factor is usually given less weight than the others.
    *   **Fairness and Efficiency:** Overall, the court assesses which forum would be more fair and efficient for all parties involved.

**Who Initiates the Transfer?**
Typically, the **federal agency (defendant)** will file a motion to transfer the case from D.C. to a district where the operative facts occurred or where the plaintiff resides, arguing that the balance of convenience and the interest of justice favor the transfer. The moving party bears the burden of demonstrating that these factors strongly favor transfer.

In summary, a D.C. federal court would transfer a civil action challenging a federal agency's decision to Nebraska or North Dakota if the case could have been properly filed there initially, and if the convenience of parties and witnesses, combined with the interest of justice (especially local interest and access to evidence), strongly outweighs the plaintiff's choice of forum in D.C.",[],,0.8161405324935913,13.466053844288144,36.72537230172205

Here's a breakdown based on current legal understanding:

### Part 1: Must ICE/DHS consider placement in the least restrictive setting, including alternative detention programs, for all unaccompanied alien children who turn 18 and are transferred to DHS custody, regardless of their perceived flight risk or current immigration procedural status?

The answer is nuanced: **No, not in the same absolute sense as for minors, and ""regardless of perceived flight risk"" is too broad. However, DHS *is* generally required to make individualized custody determinations that *include* consideration of alternatives to detention, and cannot simply detain all former UACs automatically.**

Here's why:

1.  **Age-Out and Transfer:** When an Unaccompanied Alien Child (UAC) turns 18, they ""age out"" of UAC status. At this point, they are no longer under the direct care and custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Instead, they are transferred to the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and are treated as adults for immigration detention purposes.

2.  **Loss of Specific UAC Protections:** The specific statutory protections and mandates for ""least restrictive setting"" that apply to minors under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) and the *Flores* Settlement Agreement generally cease to apply directly once an individual turns 18. The *Flores* Agreement, for instance, primarily governs the detention of minors.

3.  **DHS's General Custody Determinations for Adults:** For adults in immigration custody, DHS has the authority to detain or release individuals on bond, parole, or through Alternatives to Detention (ATD) programs. These decisions are generally made on an **individualized basis**, considering factors such as:
    *   **Flight Risk:** The likelihood that the individual will abscond or fail to appear for future immigration proceedings.
    *   **Danger to the Community:** Whether the individual poses a threat to public safety.
    *   **Criminal History:** Any past convictions or arrests.
    *   **Ties to the Community:** Family, employment, and other connections in the U.S.
    *   **Humanitarian Factors:** Health conditions, special vulnerabilities, etc.
    *   **Availability of ATD:** Whether suitable ATD programs are available and appropriate.

4.  **Special Considerations for Former UACs (Post-J.E.F.M. Litigation):** While the direct UAC protections end, courts have recognized that former UACs are a particularly vulnerable population. Litigation, notably the *J.E.F.M. v. Lynch* (later *J.E.F.M. v. Sessions*, etc.) class action, has challenged the practice of automatically transferring UACs who turn 18 into adult detention without an individualized custody review.
    *   Courts have generally held that DHS cannot implement a *de facto* policy of automatic detention for all former UACs. Instead, DHS must conduct a **meaningful, individualized custody determination** for each individual upon their transfer from ORR custody.
    *   This individualized determination *must* include consideration of release options, including bond, parole, and **Alternatives to Detention (ATD)** programs, taking into account the individual's specific circumstances, including their history as a UAC, their immigration case, and the factors listed above (flight risk, danger, etc.).
    *   Therefore, while ""perceived flight risk"" *is* a legitimate factor for DHS to consider, DHS cannot use it as a blanket justification to detain all former UACs without first conducting an individualized assessment that explores all available options, including ATD. The ""least restrictive setting"" principle, while not a direct mandate for adults, informs the *spirit* of these individualized reviews, encouraging release or ATD where appropriate.

### Part 2: Can a class action be certified to challenge a systematic failure to do so?

**Yes, absolutely.** A class action is a highly appropriate and common mechanism to challenge a systematic failure by a government agency to adhere to its legal obligations or policies, especially when those failures affect a large, identifiable group of individuals in a similar manner.

Here's why a class action would likely be certifiable:

1.  **Rule 23 Requirements:** To certify a class action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, the plaintiffs must satisfy four prerequisites (numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation) and one of the three types of class actions under Rule 23(b).
    *   **Numerosity:** There are likely hundreds, if not thousands, of UACs who turn 18 and are transferred to DHS custody each year, making individual lawsuits impractical.
    *   **Commonality:** A ""systematic failure"" to consider least restrictive settings or ATD, or a policy of automatic detention, presents a common question of law and fact: ""Does DHS have a policy or practice that systematically fails to conduct individualized custody determinations or adequately consider ATD for former UACs?""
    *   **Typicality:** The claims of the named plaintiffs (e.g., former UACs who were automatically detained or not given proper consideration for ATD) would be typical of the claims of the entire class.
    *   **Adequacy of Representation:** The named plaintiffs and their counsel would adequately represent the interests of the class.
    *   **Rule 23(b)(2):** This is the most likely category for certification. It applies when ""the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole."" A challenge to a systematic policy or practice of detention without proper review fits this perfectly, as the plaintiffs would be seeking an injunction to compel DHS to change its practices for all class members.

2.  **Precedent:** As mentioned, the *J.E.F.M.* litigation itself was a successful class action that challenged the detention practices for UACs turning 18, demonstrating the viability of such challenges through class litigation.

In summary, while the specific ""least restrictive setting"" mandate for minors doesn't directly transfer to adults, DHS *must* conduct individualized custody determinations for former UACs, including considering ATD, and cannot simply detain them automatically. A systematic failure to do so is precisely the kind of issue that can be effectively challenged through a class action.",[],,0.8272454142570496,15.409786991251426,23.280772156713596
"If a Mexican citizen, who publicly campaigned against the Mexican Navy following the disappearance of her son, had her vacant home ransacked and observed Navy vehicles drive by her house once, but experienced no direct threats or further incidents, would she and her minor children be entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention Against Torture in the U.S. based on past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution?","No, the petitioners would not be entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention Against Torture.
The court denied the petition for review, affirming the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision.

1.  **Asylum:**
    *   **Past Persecution:** The BIA did not err in finding no past persecution. The ransacking of the vacant home was a singular event that did not cause serious or permanent damage and was more akin to ""abusive or harassing treatment"" than ""extreme conduct"" required for persecution. The incidents (ransacking and Navy vehicles driving by) did not create a threat sufficiently menacing or imminent to amount to persecution. Rangel had publicly campaigned against the Navy for four months without physical harm or direct threats, and the alleged threat lacked the ""organized, relentless campaign of intimidation"" found in cases compelling a finding of persecution.
    *   **Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution:** The BIA did not err. Petitioners failed to establish past persecution, thus were not entitled to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear.

There was no indication the Navy remained interested in or actively searching for petitioners, and the disappearance of Rangel's other son was determined to be unrelated to her campaigning.

2.  **Withholding of Removal:** The BIA did not err. Withholding of removal is a higher standard than asylum. Since petitioners failed to demonstrate they suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution for asylum, they necessarily failed to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.

However, based on the facts provided, here's an analysis for each form of relief:

---

### I. Asylum

Asylum requires a showing of either **past persecution** or a **well-founded fear of future persecution** on account of a protected ground (race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion).

**A. Past Persecution**

1.  **Definition of Persecution:** Persecution is generally defined as harm or suffering that is severe enough to constitute a serious deprivation of liberty or life. It must be inflicted by the government or by forces the government is unable or unwilling to control.
2.  **Protected Ground:** The woman's public campaign against the Mexican Navy clearly falls under **political opinion**. She is expressing dissent against a government entity regarding a matter of public concern (her son's disappearance and the Navy's alleged involvement/inaction).
3.  **Analysis of Facts:**
    *   **Ransacked Vacant Home:** While deeply disturbing and intimidating, the ransacking of a *vacant* home, without direct physical harm to the applicant or her children, and without significant loss of essential property, might not, on its own, rise to the level of ""persecution"" as defined by U.S. immigration law. It's more likely to be considered severe harassment or intimidation.
    *   **Navy Vehicles:** Observing Navy vehicles drive by once, while adding to the intimidation, is not persecution in itself.
    *   **No Direct Threats/Further Incidents:** The absence of direct threats or further incidents *after* the initial events weakens a claim of *past* persecution.

**Conclusion for Past Persecution:** It is **unlikely** that the ransacking of a vacant home and a single observation of Navy vehicles would, by themselves, be deemed severe enough to constitute past persecution. These events are strong indicators of *harassment* and *intimidation*, but typically, past persecution requires more direct and severe harm to the person or their immediate family.

**B. Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution**

1.  **Standard:** A ""well-founded fear"" requires both a subjective component (the applicant genuinely fears persecution) and an objective component (there is a reasonable possibility – generally considered to be at least a 10% chance – that the applicant would be persecuted if returned).
2.  **Protected Ground:** Again, **political opinion**.
3.  **Analysis of Facts:**
    *   **Public Campaign Against Navy:** This is a high-risk activity in a country like Mexico, where security forces are often implicated in human rights abuses and disappearances, and where activists face significant danger.
    *   **Son's Disappearance:** The context of her son's disappearance, and her belief that the Navy is involved, provides a strong basis for her fear.
    *   **Targeted Intimidation:** The ransacking of her home (even if vacant) and the observation of Navy vehicles are not random acts. They are targeted actions by a state actor (or those acting with its acquiescence) directly linked to her activism. This demonstrates that the Navy is aware of her, knows her address, and is willing to take intimidating actions.
    *   **Lack of Direct Threats/Further Incidents:** While this weakens a *past persecution* claim, it doesn't necessarily negate a *future persecution* claim. The initial incidents could be interpreted as a ""warning shot"" or a form of psychological pressure. The fact that the Navy has shown it can locate her and act against her property creates a credible threat.
    *   **Country Conditions:** General country conditions in Mexico regarding human rights, disappearances, impunity for security forces, and dangers faced by human rights defenders and activists would be highly relevant and would likely support her claim.
    *   **Children:** If the mother has a well-founded fear of persecution, her minor children would typically be included in her asylum grant as derivatives. Furthermore, children of activists can themselves be targets of intimidation or harm to pressure their parents.

**Conclusion for Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution:** This is the **strongest claim**. Given the applicant's public activism against a powerful state entity (the Navy) in a country known for human rights abuses, the targeted ransacking of her home, and the surveillance by Navy vehicles, there is a **reasonable possibility** that she and her children would face persecution if returned. The events, while not physically harmful *yet*, demonstrate a clear intent to intimidate and silence her, and the risk of escalation is significant. An immigration judge would likely consider these facts, combined with country conditions, to establish a well-founded fear.

---

### II. Withholding of Removal

Withholding of Removal has a higher standard than asylum. It requires the applicant to show that it is **more likely than not** (a clear probability, >50% chance) that their life or freedom would be threatened on account of a protected ground.

**Analysis:** While the applicant has a strong argument for a well-founded fear, proving it is ""more likely than not"" that she would be persecuted is a higher bar. The lack of direct physical harm, direct threats, or *ongoing* incidents makes it difficult to meet this ""more likely than not"" standard based *solely* on the facts provided.

**Conclusion for Withholding of Removal:** It is **unlikely** she would meet the ""more likely than not"" standard for withholding of removal based on these facts alone, unless significant additional evidence of ongoing threats or severe country conditions directly impacting her situation were presented.

---

### III. Relief Under the Convention Against Torture (CAT)

CAT relief requires the applicant to show that it is **more likely than not** (>50% chance) that they would be tortured if removed to their country. Torture is defined as severe physical or mental pain or suffering intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.

**Analysis:**
*   **Definition of Torture:** The acts described (ransacking a vacant home, single observation of Navy vehicles) do not, in themselves, constitute ""torture"" as defined by CAT. While intimidating and causing mental distress, they do not meet the ""severe physical or mental pain or suffering"" threshold for torture *yet*.
*   **Intent:** The intent behind these actions appears to be intimidation and harassment, not necessarily the infliction of severe pain for purposes of torture.
*   **Likelihood of Future Torture:** While there might be a fear of future persecution, proving it is ""more likely than not"" that she would be *tortured* specifically (as opposed to other forms of persecution) is a very high bar not met by the current facts.

**Conclusion for CAT:** It is **unlikely** she would qualify for relief under the Convention Against Torture based on the facts provided, as the actions do not rise to the level of torture, and there isn't sufficient evidence to show a ""more likely than not"" chance of future torture.

---

### Overall Conclusion

Based on the provided facts:

*   The woman and her minor children would have a **strong claim for asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution** on account of her political opinion. The targeted intimidation by a state actor she is publicly criticizing, especially in the context of her son's disappearance and general country conditions in Mexico, creates a reasonable possibility of future harm.
*   It is **unlikely** they would qualify for Withholding of Removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture, as these forms of relief have higher evidentiary standards that are not met by the current facts.

**Important Caveats:**

*   **Credibility:** The applicant's testimony would be crucial, and she would need to be found credible by the adjudicator.
*   **Corroboration:** Evidence such as news articles about her campaign, reports on human rights abuses by the Mexican Navy, country condition reports, and any documentation related to her son's disappearance would significantly strengthen her case.
*   **Legal Representation:** The assistance of an experienced immigration attorney would be vital in presenting the strongest possible case.
*   **Discretion:** Asylum is a discretionary form of relief, meaning even if eligibility is met, an adjudicator *can* deny it under certain circumstances (though this is rare for strong cases). Withholding of Removal and CAT are mandatory if eligibility is met.",[],,0.8471342921257019,15.566065449010658,28.468922550052724

Here's a breakdown of the legal principles and obstacles:

1.  **General Rule: Law in Effect at Time of Adjudication:**
    *   Immigration law generally applies the law in effect at the time of the agency's decision, not the law that existed when the application was filed. While there can be exceptions (e.g., specific statutory savings clauses or *nunc pro tunc* relief in very limited circumstances), these are rare and typically require a clear legal basis. A 35-year gap makes this principle particularly strong.

2.  **Repealed Deportation Waiver:**
    *   A federal court cannot compel an agency to apply a law or grant a benefit that has been repealed. Once a waiver provision is repealed, it generally ceases to exist as a legal remedy. The purpose of compelling adjudication would be futile if the desired relief (the waiver) is no longer available.

3.  **Intervening Criminal Conviction:**
    *   A criminal conviction can render an alien inadmissible or deportable under current immigration law, regardless of their eligibility at the time of the original filing. Many criminal offenses are statutory bars to obtaining lawful permanent resident status or other immigration benefits. A court would not compel USCIS to ignore current statutory bars.

4.  **Fraudulent Conduct:**
    *   Fraudulent conduct is a severe impediment in immigration proceedings. It can lead to findings of inadmissibility (e.g., for misrepresentation of a material fact to gain an immigration benefit), permanent bars to relief, and is a strong equitable argument against the alien. Courts are generally disinclined to grant equitable relief (like mandamus to compel agency action) to individuals who have engaged in fraud.

5.  **Judicial Review Limitations (INA § 242):**
    *   The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) significantly limits judicial review over certain immigration decisions, particularly those involving discretionary judgments and decisions concerning criminal aliens. While courts can compel an agency to act on an unreasonably delayed application under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) or through a writ of mandamus (28 U.S.C. § 1361), this power is typically limited to compelling a *ministerial duty* or an *adjudication* itself, not to dictate the *outcome* or the *specific law* to be applied, especially when it involves discretionary decisions or repealed statutes.

6.  **Futility:**
    *   Even if a court *were* to compel USCIS to adjudicate the application, the outcome would almost certainly be a denial based on current law, the alien's ineligibility due to the criminal conviction and fraud, and the non-existence of the desired waiver. Courts generally do not compel actions that would be futile.

In summary, the combination of the general rule that current law applies, the repeal of the desired waiver, the alien's criminal conviction, and fraudulent conduct creates an insurmountable barrier to a federal court compelling USCIS to adjudicate the application under the specific conditions requested. The court would likely find that the alien is ineligible for the requested relief under current law and that the desired outcome is legally impossible.",[],,0.8328812718391418,15.459677323420077,22.553910037174774
"An individual, Mr. Rodriguez, is a long-time lawful permanent resident of the U.S. who has a final order of removal. After the initial 90-day statutory removal period, he is detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for an additional 10 months. During this prolonged detention, he alleges that federal immigration officials, knowing that his removal to his home country was not possible and that he was ineligible for removal to a third country, made false statements in official documents to justify his continued detention. Mr. Rodriguez seeks monetary damages against these federal officials under a *Bivens* action, claiming violations of his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights for unreasonable seizure and prolonged detention without due process.

2.  **The *Ziglar v. Abbasi* Framework (2017):**
    *   This case significantly narrowed the availability of *Bivens* actions. The Court established a two-step inquiry:

        *   Yes. While the claims involve the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, the context of immigration detention, particularly post-removal order detention and allegations of official misconduct within that specific framework, is meaningfully different from the original *Bivens* cases. It involves a distinct statutory and regulatory scheme and a unique area of federal power.

    *   **Step 2: Special Factors Counselling Hesitation?**
        *   **Immigration Context:** This is the most significant hurdle. The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that immigration is an area of ""special solicitude"" for Congress, which has plenary power over immigration matters. The Court views Congress as having established a comprehensive statutory scheme for immigration enforcement, detention, and removal.
        *   **Congressional Remedial Scheme:** Congress has provided extensive mechanisms for challenging immigration detention and removal, primarily through habeas corpus (§ 2241). While habeas corpus provides for release from unlawful detention, it does not provide monetary damages. However, the existence of *any* congressional scheme, even if it doesn't offer the desired remedy, is often seen by the Court as a reason to defer to Congress and not create a new judicial remedy.
        *   **Separation of Powers/Judicial Deference:** Allowing *Bivens* actions in this context would invite federal courts to second-guess the day-to-day operational decisions of immigration officials and potentially interfere with the executive branch's enforcement of immigration laws and Congress's detailed framework.
        *   **Recent Precedent: *Egbert v. Boule* (2022):** This case is highly relevant. The Supreme Court explicitly rejected a *Bivens* claim against a Border Patrol agent for excessive force and retaliation, stating that the ""border patrol context"" is a special factor counselling hesitation. The Court reiterated that ""a *Bivens* action is not available for claims arising out of the immigration context."" This ruling strongly suggests that any *Bivens* claim against federal immigration officials, regardless of the specific constitutional violation alleged, will be rejected.

**Conclusion:**

Given the Supreme Court's severe curtailment of the *Bivens* doctrine, particularly in areas where Congress has legislated extensively and where separation of powers concerns are heightened (like immigration), Mr. Rodriguez would face an insurmountable challenge in pursuing a *Bivens* action. The Court's recent decision in *Egbert v. Boule* makes it clear that the ""immigration context"" itself is a special factor precluding *Bivens* remedies. While Mr. Rodriguez's allegations of false statements and prolonged detention are serious, the current legal landscape indicates that a *Bivens* action for monetary damages is not an available remedy against federal immigration officials. His primary avenue for relief from unlawful detention would be a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.",[],,0.8252024054527283,14.028291296304655,23.321503857780982

However, there are specific circumstances and legal avenues an immigrant investor might explore, particularly given the factors you've outlined: a 29-month wait, an underrepresented country, and a period of program lapse.

Here's a breakdown of the circumstances and methods:

**I. USCIS Expedite Request (Administrative)**

An investor can file an expedite request directly with USCIS. However, these are granted sparingly and require meeting specific criteria. The fact that the investor is from an underrepresented country or has waited 29 months (including a lapse) is generally *not* sufficient on its own.

**Common Expedite Criteria:**

1.  **Severe financial loss to a company or person:** This is the most common ground for EB-5. The investor would need to demonstrate that the continued delay in I-526 adjudication is causing *severe* financial loss. This is a high bar. Simply having an investment tied up is usually not enough; it might involve, for example, a critical business decision contingent on the I-526 approval, or a personal financial crisis directly attributable to the delay.
2.  **Urgent humanitarian reasons:** This typically involves life-threatening medical conditions or other extreme personal emergencies that necessitate immediate immigration.
3.  **Extreme emergent situation:** Similar to humanitarian, but broader.
4.  **Compelling U.S. government interests:** This is rare for individual petitions.
5.  **Clear USCIS error:** If the delay is demonstrably due to a specific, identifiable error by USCIS (e.g., lost file, misfiled petition, failure to act after a court order).

**Analysis for Your Scenario:**

*   **29-month wait:** While long, USCIS often cites backlogs and resource constraints. The period of program lapse (e.g., the Regional Center program lapse from June 2021 to March 2022) provides USCIS with a strong defense for delays during and immediately after that period, as they were legally unable to adjudicate many petitions. This makes arguing ""unreasonable delay"" for the *entire* 29 months more challenging for an expedite request.
*   **Underrepresented country:** This is beneficial for visa availability *after* I-526 approval, but it does not typically factor into I-526 adjudication speed.
*   **Conclusion on Expedite Request:** Unless there's a very strong case for severe financial loss or an urgent humanitarian situation *directly caused by the I-526 delay*, an administrative expedite request is unlikely to be granted based solely on the factors provided.

**II. Writ of Mandamus (Federal Lawsuit)**

This is the most direct legal tool to ""compel"" USCIS. An investor can file a lawsuit in federal court seeking a writ of mandamus, which is a court order compelling a government agency to perform a duty it is legally required to perform.

**Key Requirements for a Writ of Mandamus:**

1.  **A clear right to the relief sought:** The petitioner must have a clear right to have the agency act.
2.  **A clear duty on the part of the agency to act:** USCIS has a duty to adjudicate petitions in a timely manner.
3.  **No other adequate remedy available:** The petitioner must have exhausted administrative remedies or show that they are futile.
4.  **Unreasonable delay:** This is the critical element. The court must find that USCIS has engaged in an ""unreasonable delay"" in adjudicating the petition.

**Analysis for Your Scenario Regarding ""Unreasonable Delay"":**

Courts consider several factors (often referred to as the *TRAC* factors from *Telecommunications Research & Action Center v. FCC*) when determining if a delay is unreasonable:

1.  **Time agency takes vs. statutory/regulatory limits:** There are no specific statutory deadlines for I-526 adjudication, so courts look at what is ""reasonable.""
2.  **Prejudice to the petitioner:** The investor would need to demonstrate significant prejudice (e.g., severe financial loss, inability to pursue critical life plans, health issues exacerbated by delay). This is where the ""severe financial loss"" argument from the expedite request becomes crucial.
3.  **Effect of delay on agency's ability to carry out duties:** Courts are generally reluctant to interfere if ordering an agency to act would disrupt its overall operations or other priorities.
4.  **Other interests served by agency delay:** This could include the need for thorough background checks, fraud prevention, or managing backlogs.
5.  **Agency bad faith or willful delay:** This is extremely difficult to prove.
6.  **Complexity of the case:** Highly complex cases might justify longer delays.

**Applying to Your Specifics:**

*   **29-month wait:** While long, the court will likely consider the period when the program was lapsed. USCIS will argue they could not adjudicate during that time and have faced a significant backlog since reauthorization. The ""actionable"" period of delay (i.e., when USCIS *could* have been adjudicating but didn't) might be considered shorter than 29 months.
*   **Underrepresented country:** This factor is generally not relevant to the ""unreasonable delay"" of the I-526 adjudication itself. It might become relevant if the I-526 was approved but the visa was delayed due to a lack of numbers, but that's a different stage.
*   **Prejudice:** The investor would need to present compelling evidence of specific, severe prejudice directly resulting from the *active* delay (i.e., the delay since the program was reauthorized and USCIS could resume adjudication). This could include:
    *   Loss of a critical business opportunity tied to the investment.
    *   Deterioration of health requiring access to U.S. medical care.
    *   Significant personal hardship (e.g., children aging out, inability to pursue education).
*   **Current Processing Times:** A key factor for a court is how the individual's processing time compares to USCIS's *published processing times* for similar petitions. If the 29 months (or the active portion of it) is significantly beyond the current published times, it strengthens the case.

**Conclusion on Mandamus:**

A writ of mandamus is a viable option, but it is challenging and costly. Success hinges on demonstrating that the delay, *after accounting for the program lapse and subsequent backlog*, is truly ""unreasonable"" and causing significant, demonstrable prejudice to the investor. It's not a guaranteed outcome, as courts often give deference to agency discretion in managing backlogs, especially after legislative changes or program reauthorizations.

**III. Other Avenues (Less ""Compelling"")**

*   **Congressional Inquiry:** Contacting a U.S. Senator or Representative can sometimes prompt USCIS to review a case, but it doesn't legally compel them to expedite.
*   **USCIS Ombudsman:** The Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman can assist individuals with case problems, but they also cannot compel USCIS to act.
*   **Regular Case Inquiries:** Periodically checking case status online and making inquiries through USCIS customer service.

**Recommendation:**

Given the complexity and the high bar for compelling USCIS, an immigrant investor in this situation should:

1.  **Consult with an experienced immigration attorney** specializing in EB-5 and mandamus actions.
2.  **Gather strong evidence of prejudice** (financial, personal, etc.) directly linked to the I-526 delay.
3.  **Review current USCIS processing times** for I-526 petitions to assess how far beyond the norm the current wait is, considering the program lapse.
4.  **Consider filing a writ of mandamus** if the attorney believes there is a strong case for ""unreasonable delay"" and significant prejudice, and the investor is prepared for the time and cost involved in litigation.",[],,0.8238504528999329,13.078235294117647,31.577058823529427
"An individual's EB-5 visa petition was initially approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) but later revoked.

Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Review of USCIS's Discretionary Revocation Decision (Merits Review):**

    *   **General Principle:** Federal courts generally have jurisdiction to review final agency actions under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq. This includes decisions made by USCIS.
    *   **Standard of Review:** The court will review whether USCIS's decision was ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law"" (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). This is not a *de novo* review, meaning the court will not substitute its own judgment for that of USCIS. Instead, it will examine whether USCIS:
        *   **Acted within its statutory authority:** Did USCIS have the legal power to revoke the petition under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and its implementing regulations (e.g., 8 CFR § 205.1)?
        *   **Followed proper procedures:** Did USCIS provide adequate notice and an opportunity to respond before revoking the petition?
        *   **Made a decision based on relevant factors and evidence:** Was there a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made? Was the decision supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record?
        *   **Misinterpreted immigration law:** If the individual asserts USCIS misinterpreted immigration law, this is a ""question of law"" which federal courts are generally empowered to review. The court would apply principles of statutory interpretation, potentially deferring to USCIS's reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutory provisions (under *Chevron* deference).
    *   **""Merits"" Review:** While the court won't re-decide the case, reviewing whether the decision was ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law"" *is* a review of the merits of the agency's reasoning, process, and legal conclusions. If the court finds USCIS misinterpreted the law, failed to consider relevant evidence, or acted without a rational basis, it can vacate the revocation and remand the case back to USCIS for reconsideration.

2.  **Relief Based on the Department of State's Alleged Recommendation:**

    *   **Consular Nonreviewability Doctrine:** This is the primary obstacle. U.S. federal courts generally lack jurisdiction to review the decisions of consular officers abroad, including their recommendations or findings related to visa eligibility. This doctrine is rooted in the separation of powers and the executive branch's authority over foreign policy and immigration.
    *   **Limited Exceptions:** While there are very narrow exceptions (e.g., certain constitutional claims, particularly if the individual is physically present in the U.S. and has a strong U.S. nexus, or clear misinterpretation of law by the consular officer that is not discretionary), these are rarely successful in challenging consular decisions or recommendations directly.
    *   **Impact on USCIS Decision:** If the Department of State made a *recommendation* to USCIS, and USCIS then acted on that recommendation, the challenge would primarily be against USCIS's *decision* to revoke, not directly against the DOS recommendation itself. The individual could argue that USCIS's reliance on an ""invalid"" DOS recommendation rendered USCIS's *own* revocation decision arbitrary, capricious, or not in accordance with law. However, even in this scenario, the court would likely be very deferential to the DOS's findings or recommendations, especially if they pertain to factual matters or interpretations of foreign law or policy. It would be extremely difficult to get a federal court to grant relief *solely* on the basis that the DOS recommendation was ""invalid"" in a way that directly binds the DOS or forces USCIS to disregard it.

**Conclusion:**

A U.S. federal court **can** review the merits of USCIS's discretionary revocation decision to determine if it was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or contrary to law, including whether USCIS misinterpreted immigration law.

However, it is **highly unlikely** that a federal court would grant relief directly based on the alleged invalidity of a Department of State recommendation due to the strong doctrine of consular nonreviewability. The challenge would need to be framed as USCIS's *improper reliance* on that recommendation, leading to an unlawful or arbitrary USCIS decision, but even then, the court's ability to second-guess the DOS's input would be very limited.",[],,0.8258091807365417,15.436541172106828,21.90493045252228
"A couple from Honduras seeks asylum in the U.S., claiming persecution as ""Honduran business owners"" due to gang extortion.

1.  **Rejection of the ""Honduran Business Owners"" Particular Social Group (PSG):**
    *   **BIA's Stance:** The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has consistently held that ""business owners"" or similar economic groups generally do not constitute a valid Particular Social Group for asylum purposes. This is because they typically fail to meet the core requirements of a PSG:
        *   **Immutability:** Being a business owner is generally not considered an immutable characteristic; one can cease to be a business owner.
        *   **Particularity:** The group ""Honduran business owners"" is often deemed too broad and amorphous to be ""particular.""
        *   **Social Visibility/Perception:** While business owners may be visible, the group itself is often not perceived by society in the relevant country as a distinct group for purposes of persecution, separate from their economic activity.
        *   **Nexus:** Persecution based on generalized extortion by gangs is often viewed as being on account of wealth or opportunity, rather than on account of membership in a distinct social group.
    *   **Fifth Circuit Review:** The Fifth Circuit reviews the BIA's legal interpretations of asylum law, including PSG criteria, with deference (often under the *Chevron* framework). It reviews the BIA's factual findings for ""substantial evidence."" Given the BIA's consistent jurisprudence on this issue, it is highly likely that the Fifth Circuit would **uphold the BIA's rejection** of ""Honduran business owners"" as a valid PSG. The BIA's decision would likely be found to be supported by substantial evidence and not contrary to law.
    *   **Consequence:** Without a valid PSG (or other protected ground like race, religion, nationality, or political opinion), the asylum claim fails. Since withholding of removal has an even higher standard of proof and relies on the same protected grounds, it would also fail.

2.  **New Arguments Attempted on Review (e.g., alternative PSGs, NTA sufficiency):**
    *   **Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:** This is the critical legal principle here. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1), a court of appeals may review a final order of removal only if ""the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.""
    *   **Application:** Because the couple ""do not raise any alternative particular social groups or challenge the sufficiency of their initial Notice to Appear"" before the Immigration Judge or the BIA, they have failed to exhaust their administrative remedies on these issues.
    *   **Fifth Circuit Outcome:** The Fifth Circuit would almost certainly **lack jurisdiction** to consider any new arguments raised for the first time on judicial review. This includes:
        *   Any alternative PSGs (e.g., ""members of a particular family,"" ""political opinion"" based on opposition to gangs, etc.).
        *   Challenges to the sufficiency of the Notice to Appear (NTA), even in light of *Pereira v. Sessions* or *Niz-Chavez v. Garland*, because this argument was not presented to the agency below.
    *   **Consequence:** These new arguments would be procedurally barred and would not be considered by the court.

**Overall Likely Outcome:**

The Fifth Circuit would likely **deny the petition for review**. The BIA's rejection of ""Honduran business owners"" as a particular social group would be upheld, and any new arguments the couple attempts to raise would be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction due to the failure to exhaust administrative remedies. This would result in the affirmation of the BIA's decision to deny asylum and withholding of removal.",[],,0.8148524761199951,13.889095607235145,32.36027562446171
"I was convicted of an aggravated felony in Louisiana as a first-time offender and received an automatic first-offender pardon after completing my sentence. Does this type of pardon qualify as a ""full and unconditional executive pardon"" under federal immigration regulations, allowing me to demonstrate good moral character for naturalization purposes despite my aggravated felony conviction?","No, the court affirmed the denial of naturalization, holding that Louisiana's automatic first-offender pardon is not a ""full and unconditional executive pardon"" as required by 8 C.F.R. § 316.10. The court reasoned that Louisiana state law does not consider an automatic first-offender pardon to restore a ""status of innocence,"" unlike a gubernatorial pardon, making USCIS’s interpretation permissible.",,,,,,,,"No, the court affirmed the denial of naturalization, holding that Louisiana's automatic first-offender pardon is not a ""full and unconditional executive pardon"" as required by 8 C.F.R. § 316.10. The court reasoned that Louisiana state law does not consider an automatic first-offender pardon to restore a ""status of innocence,"" unlike a gubernatorial pardon, making USCIS’s interpretation permissible.","Unfortunately, the ""automatic first-offender pardon"" you received in Louisiana likely **does not** qualify as a ""full and unconditional executive pardon"" under federal immigration regulations for demonstrating good moral character (GMC) for naturalization purposes, especially when dealing with an aggravated felony.

Here's why:

1.  **Aggravated Felony and Good Moral Character:**
    *   A conviction for an aggravated felony is generally a **permanent bar** to establishing good moral character for naturalization purposes. This means that, absent a qualifying pardon, you cannot naturalize.

2.  **The ""Full and Unconditional Executive Pardon"" Exception:**
    *   Federal immigration law (specifically, Section 101(f)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act) states that a person is not precluded from establishing good moral character if they have been ""pardoned by the President of the United States, or by the governor of any of the several States... for the offense for which he was convicted.""
    *   USCIS and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) have consistently interpreted this to mean a pardon that is:
        *   **Executive:** It must be granted by the President or a state Governor, as a discretionary act of clemency.
        *   **Full and Unconditional:** It must completely erase the legal consequences of the conviction as if it never happened, without any conditions attached.

3.  **The Louisiana Automatic First-Offender Pardon:**
    *   Louisiana Revised Statute 15:572.1 provides for an automatic pardon for first-felony offenders who complete their sentence without a subsequent felony conviction.
    *   **The critical distinction for immigration purposes is that this pardon is *automatic* and *statutory*, not a discretionary act of the Governor.** It is granted by operation of law, not through an individual review and grant of clemency by the Governor.
    *   Because it is not a discretionary act of the Governor, it does not meet the federal immigration definition of an ""executive pardon.""

**Conclusion:**

While the Louisiana automatic first-offender pardon restores many civil rights under state law, it is generally **not recognized by federal immigration authorities** as the type of ""full and unconditional executive pardon"" required to overcome an aggravated felony bar to good moral character for naturalization.

Therefore, despite receiving this automatic pardon, your aggravated felony conviction would likely still be considered a permanent bar to naturalization by USCIS.

**What You Should Do:**

It is absolutely crucial to **consult with an experienced immigration attorney** who specializes in complex naturalization cases, especially those involving criminal convictions and pardons. They can:

*   Review the specifics of your conviction and the exact language of your pardon.
*   Analyze the current USCIS and BIA precedent regarding Louisiana's automatic pardons.
*   Advise you on any potential (though likely very limited) avenues for naturalization, which might include seeking a *discretionary, executive pardon* directly from the Governor of Louisiana (a separate and much more difficult process than the automatic one you received).

Do not proceed with a naturalization application without professional legal advice, as misrepresenting your criminal history or applying when ineligible can have severe negative consequences.",[],,0.8228597640991211,17.688999999999997,10.275491525423746

Dr. Sharma is now in the U.S. in H-1B status, which was the ultimate goal. A court cannot undo her travel or provide any further relief regarding *this specific petition*. Therefore, this part of the lawsuit is almost certainly **moot**.
    *   **Exception (Capable of Repetition, Yet Evading Review):** While HealthFirst might argue this issue is ""capable of repetition, yet evading review,"" this exception typically applies when the duration of the challenged action is too short to be fully litigated before it expires or is rendered moot. Here, the specific injury (the travel) was remedied. While the *underlying policy* might be capable of repetition, the specific claim related to Dr. Sharma's petition is no longer a live controversy.

2.  **Standing and Ripeness Regarding the ""H-4 Only"" Policy Challenge:**
    *   **The Issue:** To have standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate an ""injury in fact"" that is concrete and particularized, and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. The injury must be fairly traceable to the defendant's challenged action and likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision. Ripeness concerns whether a dispute has matured sufficiently to warrant judicial intervention.
    *   **Application:** HealthFirst seeks a declaratory judgment challenging USCIS's alleged ""H-4 only"" policy for J-2 dependents, claiming it negatively impacts their *future* ability to hire J-2 spouses. However, HealthFirst ""has not identified any specific future J-2 candidates it wishes to hire.""
    *   **Conclusion:**
        *   **Lack of Concrete Injury:** HealthFirst's claimed injury is speculative and hypothetical. They have not identified any specific J-2 spouse they have attempted to hire, nor have they faced a specific denial based on this alleged policy for a future candidate. A generalized grievance about a potential future problem does not constitute a concrete and imminent ""injury in fact"" required for standing.
        *   **Lack of Ripeness:** Without a specific application, a specific J-2 candidate, and a specific denial based on the challenged policy, the issue is not ripe for judicial review. The court would be asked to rule on an abstract policy without a concrete factual context.

In summary, the specific claim related to Dr. Sharma's petition is moot because the relief sought has been obtained. The broader challenge to the ""H-4 only"" policy lacks standing and ripeness because HealthFirst has not demonstrated a concrete, imminent injury or presented a specific, matured controversy.",[],,0.8398934006690979,11.730366136810144,38.434010835268225
"An undocumented immigrant, Mr. Garcia, received a Notice to Appear (NTA) from the Department of Homeland Security in 2020 that charged him with removability but did not specify the date or time of his initial hearing. Mr. Garcia applied for cancellation of removal, arguing that his U.S. citizen child, who suffers from a severe, rare medical condition requiring ongoing specialized treatment, would face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if he were removed. He also sought administrative closure while pursuing a U visa. The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied cancellation of removal, finding Mr. Garcia failed to establish the requisite hardship and good moral character, and did not rule on the motion for administrative closure. On appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), Mr. Garcia argued the NTA was deficient, depriving the agency of jurisdiction or, alternatively, constituting a claim-processing error. He also challenged the IJ's hardship finding and reiterated his request for administrative closure. After the BIA dismissed his appeal, his U visa application was denied, and he was subsequently removed. Can Mr. Garcia successfully challenge the BIA's decision regarding the NTA deficiency, the hardship finding for cancellation of removal, or the denial of administrative closure?","No, Mr. Garcia cannot successfully challenge the BIA's decision on these grounds.
1.  **NTA Deficiency:** The omission of time and place information from a Notice to Appear (NTA) does not deprive the Immigration Judge of subject-matter jurisdiction over removal proceedings. Furthermore, an objection to a noncompliant NTA is a claim-processing rule that is waived or forfeited if not timely raised by the closing of pleadings before the IJ.
2.  **Exceptional Hardship for Cancellation of Removal:** While the application of the ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" standard is a mixed question of law and fact reviewable by the court, the agency's underlying factual findings are unreviewable. Taking the agency's factual findings as conclusive (unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary), such as the availability of transportation for medical appointments, sufficient involvement by the other parent, and adequate financial support, the agency did not err in determining that Mr. Garcia's removal would not result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his qualifying relative. The agency's no-hardship finding is dispositive, making it unnecessary to reach any flaws in a moral-character analysis.
3.  **Administrative Closure:** Mr. Garcia's claim that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion for administrative closure or a continuance has been mooted by the denial of his U visa application and his subsequent removal from the United States, as it is impossible for the court to grant him any effectual relief.",,,,,,,,"No, Mr. Garcia cannot successfully challenge the BIA's decision on these grounds.

Here's a breakdown:

**1. Challenge to the NTA Deficiency:**

*   **Legal Principle:** The Supreme Court cases *Pereira v. Sessions* (2018) and *Niz-Chavez v. Garland* (2021) established that a Notice to Appear (NTA) that does not specify the time and place of the initial hearing is deficient for purposes of triggering the ""stop-time rule"" for cancellation of removal. However, *Niz-Chavez* clarified that such a deficiency **does not deprive the immigration courts of subject-matter jurisdiction**. Instead, it is considered a ""claim-processing rule.""
*   **Application to Mr. Garcia:**
    *   Mr. Garcia's NTA, issued in 2020 without a date or time, was indeed deficient under *Pereira* and *Niz-Chavez*.
    *   He correctly argued it was a claim-processing error. However, his argument that it deprived the agency of *jurisdiction* would likely fail based on *Niz-Chavez*.
    *   **Impact on his case:** The primary effect of a deficient NTA is on the stop-time rule for cancellation of removal. If the NTA doesn't stop the clock, an applicant might accrue the necessary 10 years of continuous physical presence. However, the IJ denied Mr. Garcia's cancellation of removal based on his failure to establish **hardship** and **good moral character**, not on the stop-time rule. Therefore, while the NTA was deficient, it likely did not directly cause the denial of his cancellation of removal application.
*   **Likelihood of Success:** While he could successfully argue the NTA was deficient as a claim-processing error, this alone would **not likely lead to a successful challenge of the BIA's decision or a reopening of his case**, especially since the denial of cancellation of removal was based on other grounds (hardship and good moral character) and he has already been removed. To succeed, he would need to show how this specific deficiency prejudiced him in a way that led to an erroneous denial of his relief, which is difficult given the IJ's stated reasons.

**2. Challenge to the Hardship Finding for Cancellation of Removal:**

*   **Legal Principle:** Cancellation of removal requires an applicant to demonstrate ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" to a qualifying U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse, parent, or child. This is a very high discretionary bar, and the determination is highly fact-specific. Appellate courts generally give significant deference to the IJ and BIA's findings on hardship, only overturning them if there is a clear error of law or an abuse of discretion (e.g., ignoring relevant evidence, applying the wrong legal standard).
*   **Application to Mr. Garcia:**
    *   Mr. Garcia presented compelling evidence regarding his U.S. citizen child's severe, rare medical condition. This is strong evidence, but the IJ found it did not meet the ""exceptional and extremely unusual"" standard.
    *   Crucially, the IJ also found Mr. Garcia failed to establish **good moral character**, which is an independent and equally essential requirement for cancellation of removal. If he failed to establish good moral character, then cancellation of removal would be denied regardless of the hardship finding.
*   **Likelihood of Success:** It is **highly unlikely** Mr. Garcia could successfully challenge the BIA's decision regarding the hardship finding.
    *   **Discretionary Nature:** Hardship determinations are highly discretionary and difficult to overturn on appeal unless there's a clear legal error or abuse of discretion.
    *   **Good Moral Character:** Even if he could somehow challenge the hardship finding, the denial based on a lack of good moral character would remain, independently barring him from cancellation of removal. The question does not provide details on why good moral character was denied, but it's a critical hurdle.
    *   **Post-Removal:** Challenging a discretionary decision after removal is exceedingly difficult.

**3. Challenge to the Denial of Administrative Closure:**

*   **Legal Principle:** Administrative closure is a procedural tool that temporarily removes a case from an IJ's active calendar. However, the BIA's decision in *Matter of Castro-Tum* (2018) held that IJs and the BIA generally **do not have the inherent authority to administratively close cases** except where specifically authorized by regulation. This significantly limited the availability of administrative closure for purposes like pursuing a U visa.
*   **Application to Mr. Garcia:**
    *   Mr. Garcia sought administrative closure to pursue a U visa. This request was made *after* *Matter of Castro-Tum*.
    *   The IJ did not rule on the motion, which, in light of *Castro-Tum*, could be interpreted as an implicit denial based on a lack of authority or a decision not to exercise discretion.
    *   Furthermore, his U visa application was subsequently **denied**. This makes the original purpose of seeking administrative closure (to pursue the U visa) moot.
*   **Likelihood of Success:** It is **extremely unlikely** Mr. Garcia could successfully challenge the denial (or non-ruling) of administrative closure.
    *   **Lack of Authority:** Under *Matter of Castro-Tum*, IJs generally lack the authority to grant administrative closure for this purpose.
    *   **Discretionary Nature:** Even if authority existed, administrative closure is a discretionary decision, which is very difficult to overturn.
    *   **Mootness:** The denial of his U visa application removes the underlying reason for the request, rendering any challenge to the administrative closure decision moot.
    *   **Post-Removal:** As with other challenges, his removal makes this even more difficult.

**Conclusion:**

Given the legal precedents, the discretionary nature of the relief sought, the IJ's specific findings (especially regarding good moral character), and Mr. Garcia's subsequent removal, it is **highly unlikely** he could successfully challenge the BIA's decision on any of the grounds presented. While the NTA was deficient, this deficiency did not appear to be the basis for the denial of his cancellation of removal, and the other challenges face significant legal and procedural hurdles.",[],,0.8424726128578186,13.203890104546563,30.544244266148013
"An individual filed an I-526 petition under the EB-5 Regional Center Program to compel USCIS to adjudicate their application, alleging unreasonable delay.

1.  **Mootness Doctrine:** Federal courts in the United States can only hear ""cases and controversies"" as mandated by Article III of the Constitution. A case becomes moot when the issues presented are no longer ""live"" or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome. A fundamental aspect of mootness is that the court must be able to grant some effectual relief.

2.  **Application to the Scenario:**
    *   The plaintiff's goal was to compel USCIS to adjudicate their I-526 petition.
    *   This petition was filed under the EB-5 Regional Center Program.
    *   When the statutory authorization for the Regional Center Program expires, there is no longer a legal basis for USCIS to adjudicate I-526 petitions filed under that specific program.
    *   Therefore, even if the court were to issue an order compelling USCIS to adjudicate the application, USCIS would be unable to comply because the program itself no longer exists. The court's order would be an empty gesture, providing no effectual relief to the plaintiff.

3.  **No Live Controversy:** Without the ability to grant relief, there is no longer a ""live controversy"" for the court to resolve. Any decision on the merits would be an impermissible advisory opinion.

**Conclusion:**

Upon the expiration of the Regional Center Program's statutory authorization, the court would likely find that the case has become moot because it can no longer grant any effectual relief.

"Under what circumstances can a U.S. federal court compel U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to expedite the adjudication of an I-526 immigrant investor visa petition that has been pending for over four years, where the plaintiff alleges unreasonable delay under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Mandamus Act?","A U.S. federal court would not compel USCIS to expedite an I-526 immigrant investor visa petition that has been pending for over four years if the plaintiff fails to plausibly allege unreasonable delay under the ""TRAC"" factors.

Here's a breakdown of the circumstances and legal framework:

**I. Legal Basis for the Lawsuit**

1.  **Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(1):** This is the primary vehicle for challenging agency inaction. It allows a reviewing court to ""compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.""
2.  **Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1361:** This grants federal district courts jurisdiction to compel an officer or employee of the United States to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff. While often pleaded alongside the APA, the APA is generally the more direct route for ""unreasonable delay"" claims against agencies.
3.  **All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651:** This allows courts to issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions, providing the mechanism for the court to issue an order.

**II. Elements the Plaintiff Must Prove**

To succeed, the plaintiff must demonstrate:

1.  **Standing:** The plaintiff must show they have suffered an ""injury in fact"" (the delay itself and its consequences), that the injury is ""fairly traceable"" to USCIS's action (or inaction), and that a favorable court decision would ""redress"" the injury.
2.  **Unreasonable Delay:** This is the core of the claim. Courts apply a multi-factor test, often referred to as the **""TRAC factors""** (from *Telecommunications Research and Action Center v. FCC*, 750 F.2d 70 (D.C. Cir. 1984)), to determine if an agency's delay is unreasonable:
    *   **Time Agency Takes vs. Statutory/Regulatory Deadlines:** While there's no specific statutory deadline for I-526 adjudication, the absence of one doesn't give USCIS carte blanche for indefinite delay. A four-year delay is significant and will weigh in the plaintiff's favor.
    *   **Injuries Caused by the Delay:** The plaintiff must articulate specific harms resulting from the delay. For I-526 petitioners, this can include:
        *   Aging out of dependent children.
        *   Loss of investment opportunities or increased risk to the investment.
        *   Uncertainty impacting business, personal, and financial planning.
        *   Loss of priority date benefits if the petition is eventually denied and a new one must be filed.
        *   Inability to pursue other immigration options due to the pending I-526.
    *   **Agency's Explanation for the Delay:** USCIS will typically argue:
        *   **Resource constraints:** Lack of staff, high volume of petitions.
        *   **Complexity of I-526 petitions:** The need for thorough review of source of funds, job creation, and compliance with EB-5 program requirements, often involving complex business structures and fraud concerns.
        *   **Need to prioritize other cases:** E.g., national security, humanitarian cases.
        *   **Pending policy changes or litigation:** Sometimes USCIS delays adjudication pending clarification on certain policy issues.
    *   **Impact of Court Intervention on Agency Functions:** The court will consider whether ordering expedited adjudication would unduly disrupt USCIS's ability to process other cases or manage its workload.
    *   **Public Interest in Expediting:** While there's a general public interest in efficient government, the court will weigh this against the specific public interest in the thorough review of immigration petitions, especially those with potential fraud concerns like EB-5.
    *   **Mandate of Congress:** Whether Congress has provided any specific instructions or deadlines for the agency's action. (Generally absent for I-526s).

**III. Key Considerations for the Court**

*   **No Bright-Line Rule:** There is no magic number of years that automatically triggers ""unreasonable delay."" While four years is a substantial period, courts consider it in context.
*   **Discretion vs. Indefinite Delay:** While USCIS has discretion in *how* it adjudicates petitions, it does not have discretion to *indefinitely delay* adjudication. The duty to adjudicate is non-discretionary, even if the outcome is discretionary.
*   **USCIS's Burden:** Once a plaintiff demonstrates a significant delay and articulates harm, the burden often shifts to USCIS to provide a reasonable explanation for the delay.
*   **Precedent:** Courts have, in numerous instances, compelled USCIS to adjudicate petitions that have been pending for several years, particularly when the delay approaches or exceeds typical processing times for similar petitions and the plaintiff demonstrates specific harm.

**IV. Likely Outcome/Remedy**

If the court finds the delay unreasonable, it will typically issue an order compelling USCIS to:

*   **Adjudicate the I-526 petition within a specific timeframe** (e.g., 60, 90, or 120 days).
*   **Crucially, the court will *not* order USCIS to approve the petition.** The court's role is to compel a decision, not to dictate the outcome of that decision, which remains within USCIS's discretion.

**V. Conclusion**

A four-year delay for an I-526 petition provides a strong basis for a claim of unreasonable delay under the APA and Mandamus Act. However, success hinges on the plaintiff effectively demonstrating the specific harms caused by the delay and rebutting USCIS's justifications for the delay, particularly under the TRAC factors. While challenging, federal courts have a clear legal basis and precedent to intervene in such circumstances to compel agency action.",[],,0.8197461366653442,12.532309527952474,35.0548808073778
"In a case challenging an administrative denial of a visa petition, if a plaintiff seeks discovery to support a claim that the agency impermissibly applied a new policy retroactively, but mischaracterizes this retroactivity claim as a non-Administrative Procedure Act (""APA"") claim, will the court grant the discovery request?","No, the court will deny the motion for discovery because the plaintiff's retroactivity claim, invoking equitable factors from *Retail, Wholesale & Dep’t Store Union, AFL-CIO v.

However, the denial will be without prejudice, allowing the plaintiff to file a new motion for discovery that relies on the correct legal framework of the APA record rule and its exceptions.","No, generally, the court will **not** grant the discovery request in this scenario. Here's why:

1.  **Substance Over Form:** Courts look to the substance of a claim, not merely how a plaintiff labels it. A claim that an agency impermissibly applied a new policy retroactively is fundamentally a challenge to the legality of the agency's action. Such a challenge falls squarely under the **Administrative Procedure Act (APA)**, specifically 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), which allows courts to set aside agency action found to be ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.""

2.  **Limited Discovery in APA Cases:** Judicial review of agency action under the APA is generally confined to the **administrative record** that was before the agency at the time it made its decision. The purpose of APA review is to determine whether the agency's decision was rational and supported by the record, not to conduct a de novo trial or allow parties to build a new record in court.

3.  **Rationale for Limiting Discovery:**
    *   **Deference to Agency Expertise:** Courts generally defer to the agency's expertise and its decision-making process.
    *   **Efficiency:** Allowing broad discovery would transform every administrative appeal into a full-blown trial, undermining the efficiency of administrative processes.
    *   **Focus on Agency's Reasoning:** The court's role is to review the agency's reasoning based on what it considered, not to second-guess or supplement that reasoning with new evidence.

4.  **Narrow Exceptions for Extra-Record Discovery:** While rare, courts may permit limited discovery or consideration of extra-record evidence in very specific circumstances, such as:
    *   Where there is a strong showing of **bad faith or improper behavior** on the part of the agency.
    *   Where the administrative record is **incomplete or fails to explain** the agency's reasoning, making effective judicial review impossible.
    *   Where the agency's decision-making process itself is at issue, and the record does not shed light on it.

In this case, the plaintiff is seeking discovery to *prove the merits* of their retroactivity claim, not necessarily to show bad faith in compiling the record or that the record is fundamentally incomplete for review. The claim of impermissible retroactivity is a legal argument that should ideally be evaluated based on the agency's stated policies, the administrative record, and relevant legal precedents. The plaintiff would need to demonstrate that the administrative record itself is insufficient to determine whether the agency applied a new policy retroactively, or that there's evidence of bad faith that prevented the true basis of the decision from being reflected in the record. Merely mischaracterizing the claim as ""non-APA"" will not open the door to broader discovery. The court will likely treat it as an APA claim and apply the strict limits on discovery.",[],,0.8189547657966614,15.12751711116356,28.415040122728357
"A private non-profit agency, ""Hope for New Arrivals,"" contracts with the state of ""Frontierland"" to provide social services to refugees using federal funds under a program similar to the Refugee Act. Frontierland's governor, citing unsubstantiated security concerns that refugees from ""Warlordia"" may pose a terrorist threat, instructs the state to withhold reimbursement for services provided by Hope for New Arrivals to any refugee whose country of origin is Warlordia. Federal law, similar to 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(5), mandates that services funded under this program be provided ""without regard to race, religion, nationality, sex, or political opinion."" Hope for New Arrivals sues to prevent the state from withholding funds. Should the court grant a preliminary injunction in favor of Hope for New Arrivals?","Yes, the court should grant the preliminary injunction. The federal law dictates that services funded under the refugee assistance program must be provided ""without regard to race, religion, nationality, sex, or political opinion."" The governor's policy of refusing to reimburse for services to refugees from a specific country, even if purportedly based on security fears, constitutes discrimination on the basis of nationality, which is explicitly forbidden by the federal statute. The governor's fears are presented without evidence and are deemed ""nightmare speculation,"" and state action cannot override federal responsibility for immigration and refugee regulation.",,,,,,,,"Yes, the court should grant the preliminary injunction.

To obtain a preliminary injunction, the moving party (Hope for New Arrivals) typically must demonstrate:

1.  **A likelihood of success on the merits:** Hope for New Arrivals has a very strong likelihood of success. The federal law explicitly mandates that services be provided ""without regard to race, religion, nationality, sex, or political opinion."" Frontierland's governor is instructing the state to withhold reimbursement specifically based on the refugees' ""country of origin"" (Warlordia), which is a direct violation of the ""without regard to nationality"" provision of the federal statute. The governor's ""unsubstantiated security concerns"" do not override a clear federal mandate, especially when the federal law itself does not provide an exception for such concerns. This is a clear case of federal preemption under the Supremacy Clause, where state action directly conflicts with and is therefore superseded by federal law.

2.  **Irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction:** Hope for New Arrivals, as a non-profit agency providing essential social services, would suffer irreparable harm. Withholding reimbursement would directly impact its financial viability, potentially leading to:
    *   Inability to pay staff and cover operational costs.
    *   Cessation or severe reduction of critical services to vulnerable refugees.
    *   Potential insolvency or closure of the agency.
    *   While financial harm can sometimes be remedied by later damages, the threat to the very existence and mission of a non-profit providing essential services, and the immediate harm to the refugees who rely on those services, is often considered irreparable.

3.  **The balance of equities (or hardships) tips in the movant's favor:** The hardship to Hope for New Arrivals and the refugees (loss of essential services, potential agency collapse) far outweighs any legitimate hardship to the state of Frontierland. The state's ""hardship"" is essentially being compelled to comply with federal law and its contractual obligations. The governor's unsubstantiated security concerns do not create a legitimate hardship that can be balanced against the clear harm to the agency and the refugees.

4.  **The injunction is in the public interest:** Granting the injunction serves several public interests:
    *   **Upholding federal law:** It ensures that states comply with federal statutes and the Supremacy Clause.
    *   **Preventing discrimination:** It prevents discrimination based on nationality, as explicitly prohibited by federal law.
    *   **Ensuring humanitarian aid:** It allows for the continued provision of essential social services to vulnerable refugee populations, which is the very purpose of the federal program.

Given the clear violation of federal law, the severe and immediate harm to a non-profit and the vulnerable population it serves, and the strong public interest in upholding federal law and preventing discrimination, a court should grant the preliminary injunction.",[],,0.8422607183456421,16.48584637268848,18.489025604551927

1.  **Cancellation of Removal (Exceptional and Extremely Unusual Hardship):**
    *   **Likely Outcome:** The Fifth Circuit will almost certainly **find it lacks jurisdiction** to review the BIA's determination that the hardship did not meet the ""exceptional and extremely unusual"" standard.
    *   **Reasoning:** Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) and (ii), federal courts generally lack jurisdiction to review any discretionary decision by the Attorney General or the BIA regarding relief under various provisions, including cancellation of removal. The determination of whether hardship meets the ""exceptional and extremely unusual"" standard is a factual finding and a discretionary application of the law to the facts, which falls squarely within this jurisdictional bar. The Fifth Circuit consistently holds that it cannot reweigh evidence or substitute its judgment for the BIA's discretionary findings on hardship. The only narrow exception is for ""questions of law"" or ""constitutional claims,"" but the application of the hardship standard to specific facts is typically not considered a question of law reviewable by the circuit courts.

2.  **Voluntary Departure (Tax Fraud/Inconsistencies):**
    *   **Likely Outcome:** The Fifth Circuit will almost certainly **find it lacks jurisdiction** to review the BIA's discretionary denial of voluntary departure.
    *   **Reasoning:** Similar to cancellation of removal, the grant or denial of voluntary departure is a discretionary form of relief. The BIA's decision to deny voluntary departure based on adverse factors, such as ""tax fraud"" or inconsistencies in tax filings, is a discretionary determination. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) also bars judicial review of discretionary decisions regarding voluntary departure. The Fifth Circuit will not second-guess the BIA's assessment of the petitioner's credibility or the weight given to adverse factors in exercising its discretion.

3.  **Motion for Continuance (Awaiting Parents' LPR Status):**
    *   **Likely Outcome:** The Fifth Circuit is highly likely to **affirm the BIA's denial** of the motion for continuance, finding no abuse of discretion.
    *   **Reasoning:** The BIA has broad discretion in managing its docket and deciding motions for continuance. The denial of a motion for continuance is reviewed under a highly deferential ""abuse of discretion"" standard. To succeed, the petitioner would have to show that the BIA's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the law, which is a very high bar. The BIA is generally within its discretion to deny a continuance, especially when the future event (parents' LPR status) is speculative, could cause significant delay, and the petitioner already had a qualifying relative (the child) whose hardship was considered. The Fifth Circuit typically defers to the BIA's judgment on such procedural matters.

In summary, the petitioner faces significant hurdles in the Fifth Circuit. For the cancellation of removal and voluntary departure issues, the court will likely dismiss the petitions for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. For the motion to continue, the court will likely affirm the BIA's decision due to the highly deferential abuse of discretion standard.",[],,0.8515656590461731,16.012396597242592,21.566481861738566

The petitioner's failure to brief any CAT-specific arguments on appeal also results in that issue being forfeited.","This is a complex scenario, but based on the Fifth Circuit's established jurisprudence regarding Particular Social Groups (PSGs) in the context of domestic violence, the likely outcome for the asylum and withholding of removal claims is an **affirmation of the denial**, while the Convention Against Torture (CAT) claim might have a **slightly higher, though still challenging, chance of remand or success**, depending on the specific factual findings regarding government acquiescence.

Here's the primary legal reasoning:

### Asylum and Withholding of Removal Claims

**Likely Outcome:** The Fifth Circuit will likely **affirm the BIA's denial** of asylum and withholding of removal.

**Primary Legal Reasoning:**

1.  **Strict Interpretation of ""Particular Social Group"" (PSG) by the Fifth Circuit:** The Fifth Circuit has historically taken a very restrictive view of what constitutes a ""particular social group,"" especially in cases involving domestic violence. For a group to qualify as a PSG, it must generally meet three criteria:
    *   **Immutability:** A common, immutable characteristic (e.g., sex, family relationship, past status). Being a ""Salvadoran woman"" meets this. Being in a ""domestic relationship"" or ""unable to leave"" is often viewed as a mutable condition or a consequence of the abuse, not the defining immutable characteristic of the group itself.
    *   **Particularity:** The group must be defined with sufficient precision to distinguish it from the general population and be discrete.
    *   **Social Distinction:** The group must be perceived as a group by society in the country of origin. This is often the most significant hurdle for domestic violence PSGs in the Fifth Circuit.

2.  **Failure to Meet ""Social Distinction"" and/or ""Particularity"":** The proposed PSGs (""Salvadoran women in domestic relationships who are unable to leave"" or ""Salvadoran women who are viewed as property by virtue of their position in a domestic relationship"") would likely be found by the Fifth Circuit to lack the requisite ""social distinction"" and/or ""particularity.""
    *   The Fifth Circuit has consistently held that groups defined primarily by their vulnerability to private criminal activity (like domestic violence) or by the fact of being victims of crime generally do not qualify as PSGs. They often reason that while the abuse is tragic, the society in question does not perceive ""women in abusive relationships"" as a distinct social group for purposes of persecution, but rather as individuals experiencing unfortunate circumstances.
    *   The ""viewed as property"" aspect, while attempting to frame the social perception, has also struggled to gain traction as a basis for a PSG in the Fifth Circuit, which often requires a more explicit, society-wide perception of the group as distinct and targeted.

3.  **Lack of Nexus:** Even if a PSG were recognized, the applicant would still need to prove that the persecution was ""on account of"" her membership in that group. The Fifth Circuit often finds that abuse in domestic violence cases is primarily due to the individual relationship dynamics or the abuser's personal motivations, rather than the victim's membership in a broader, socially distinct group.

4.  **Precedent:** Cases like *Orellana-Molina v. Garland*, *Gonzales-Veliz v. Barr*, and *Castillo-Rodriguez v. Holder* illustrate the Fifth Circuit's reluctance to recognize domestic violence-based PSGs. While the BIA under *Matter of A-R-C-G-* (later vacated by the Attorney General) initially recognized a PSG for married women in Guatemala unable to leave their relationship, subsequent Attorney General decisions (*Matter of L-E-A-*) and the Fifth Circuit's own jurisprudence have largely foreclosed such claims.

### Convention Against Torture (CAT) Claim

**Likely Outcome:** The CAT claim faces significant challenges but has a **slightly higher chance of remand or success** compared to asylum/withholding, particularly if the record strongly supports government acquiescence.

**Primary Legal Reasoning:**

1.  **No PSG Requirement:** The most crucial distinction for CAT is that it does **not** require membership in a particular social group. This removes the primary hurdle faced by the asylum and withholding claims.

2.  **Elements of CAT:** To qualify for CAT protection, the applicant must show it is ""more likely than not"" that she would be tortured if removed to El Salvador. Torture is defined as severe physical or mental pain or suffering intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or **acquiescence** of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.

3.  **Focus on Government Acquiescence:** The key issue for the Fifth Circuit will be whether the Salvadoran government's perceived inability to protect her rises to the level of ""acquiescence.""
    *   **Acquiescence** means that a public official, prior to the activity constituting torture, is aware of the activity and thereafter breaches his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity. This can include a deliberate disregard or willful blindness to the torture.
    *   If the record clearly demonstrates that the Salvadoran authorities were aware of the severe abuse, were repeatedly contacted for help, and consistently failed to intervene or provide protection (e.g., police refusing to investigate, judges dismissing cases, lack of protective orders, or active obstruction), the Fifth Circuit might find that the BIA's denial of CAT was not supported by substantial evidence or was based on an error of law regarding acquiescence.
    *   However, simply demonstrating a general inability of the government to control crime or protect all victims of domestic violence is often not enough. The applicant must show a more direct link to official awareness and inaction specific to her case.

4.  **Standard of Review:** The Fifth Circuit reviews factual findings (like whether the government acquiesced) under the highly deferential ""substantial evidence"" standard. It reviews legal questions (like the definition of acquiescence) *de novo*. If the IJ/BIA made a factual finding that the government did *not* acquiesce, the applicant would need to show that no reasonable adjudicator could have reached that conclusion.

In summary, while the woman's story is compelling and tragic, the Fifth Circuit's strict interpretation of asylum law, particularly regarding PSGs, makes success on asylum and withholding of removal highly unlikely. The CAT claim offers a distinct legal path, but success hinges on demonstrating a high likelihood of future torture and, critically, proving the Salvadoran government's specific acquiescence to that torture.",[],,0.8269925117492676,15.874268163471243,25.378990539858734
"A non-citizen defendant, undocumented since age seven, pleads guilty to reduced drug charges in 2010, receiving a suspended sentence. In 2017, he faces deportation. His immigration attorneys inform him that his conviction makes him ineligible for cancellation of removal and permanently inadmissible to the U.S., which he alleges his trial counsel failed to clearly explain. His Motion for Appropriate Relief (MAR) for ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC) under *Padilla v. Kentucky*, and for his plea not being knowingly and voluntarily entered, is initially denied. After an appellate remand for an evidentiary hearing, the trial court again denies the MAR, concluding there was no prejudice because the defendant was already subject to deportation due to his undocumented status. On appeal, what is the likely ruling and reasoning of the appellate court regarding the trial court's order?","The appellate court would likely vacate the trial court's order in part and remand the case for further proceedings.

For cancellation of removal, the trial court failed to make findings on the defendant's physical presence, good moral character, other convictions, or the hardship his removal would cause to his U.S. citizen child, which are all prerequisites for determining the statute's potential availability to the defendant.

Kentucky*.

Here's the likely reasoning:

1.  **Misapplication of *Padilla* Prejudice:** The trial court fundamentally misunderstood and misapplied the ""prejudice"" prong of the *Strickland v. Washington* test as it applies to immigration consequences under *Padilla v. Kentucky*.
    *   **The *Padilla* Standard:** Under *Padilla*, to show prejudice, a defendant must demonstrate a ""reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.""
    *   **Trial Court's Error:** The trial court's reasoning—that there was no prejudice because the defendant was *already* subject to deportation due to his undocumented status—is flawed. While the defendant was indeed deportable as an undocumented non-citizen, the conviction for drug charges had **significantly more severe and distinct immigration consequences** than simply being undocumented.

2.  **Distinction Between Deportability and Ineligibility for Relief/Inadmissibility:**
    *   **Pre-existing Deportability:** Being undocumented makes one deportable. However, prior to a conviction, an undocumented individual might still have avenues for relief, such as **cancellation of removal** (which requires, among other things, continuous physical presence for a certain period, good moral character, and no disqualifying convictions). For someone who has been in the U.S. since age seven, cancellation of removal could have been a viable, albeit difficult, path to legal status.
    *   **Consequences of the Conviction:** The drug conviction, even for reduced charges, likely rendered the defendant:
        *   **Ineligible for Cancellation of Removal:** Many drug offenses are ""crimes involving moral turpitude"" or ""aggravated felonies"" that automatically bar eligibility for cancellation of removal and other forms of relief.
        *   **Permanently Inadmissible:** Certain drug convictions can make an individual permanently inadmissible to the U.S., meaning they cannot legally re-enter even if they were to leave.
        *   **Mandatory Deportation:** The conviction may have triggered mandatory deportation, removing any discretion the immigration judge might have had.

3.  **Rational Choice to Go to Trial:**
    *   The prejudice inquiry focuses on whether a defendant, if properly advised, would have made a different choice. For someone who has lived in the U.S. since childhood (age seven), the prospect of permanent removal with no hope of return or relief is a devastating consequence.
    *   A defendant might rationally choose to risk going to trial (even with the possibility of a longer sentence if convicted) if the alternative is a guilty plea that guarantees permanent removal and eliminates all avenues for relief. The plea, in this case, transformed a situation of *potential* deportability with *possible* avenues for relief into one of *certain* and *mandatory* removal with *no* hope of relief or future admissibility.
    *   The trial court's reasoning effectively suggests that because the defendant was already in a precarious immigration situation, the plea could not make it ""worse"" or that he had nothing to lose. This ignores the critical difference between being deportable and being *barred from all relief* and *permanently inadmissible*.

**Conclusion:**

The appellate court will likely find that the trial court's reasoning was legally erroneous because it failed to recognize the distinct and significantly more severe immigration consequences triggered by the conviction itself, which eliminated potential avenues of relief that might have been available to the defendant. The fact that the defendant was already undocumented does not negate the prejudice caused by a plea that made his immigration situation demonstrably and irrevocably worse. The case would be remanded for the trial court to properly assess whether, had the defendant been fully and accurately advised of these specific, dire consequences, there is a reasonable probability he would have rejected the plea and insisted on going to trial.",[],,0.8252315521240234,16.855483527454243,17.03506555740435
"Maya was arrested and held in the Smith County Jail on state misdemeanor charges. After posting bond for these charges, she was eligible for release. However, the Smith County Sheriff continued to detain Maya based on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer and an administrative arrest warrant (Form I-200) for civil immigration violations. The Smith County Sheriff's office has an active 287(g) agreement with ICE, authorizing its deputies to perform specific immigration enforcement functions. Maya's legal counsel filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in state superior court, arguing that her continued detention by the Sheriff was unlawful because the federal detainer lacked probable cause and the Sheriff lacked state authority to detain her for civil immigration purposes. The petition explicitly mentioned the Sheriff's 287(g) agreement.

The application, by explicitly stating that Maya is being held pursuant to an immigration detainer and I-200 Form, and acknowledging the Sheriff's 287(g) agreement, informs the state court that its state law authority to inquire into the lawfulness of the detention is superseded by federal law.

Challenges to the validity of the immigration process itself are reserved for federal, not state, judicial officials.","Yes, the state superior court should likely grant Maya's request for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus and order her discharge.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  **Jurisdiction of State Courts in Habeas Corpus:** State superior courts have jurisdiction to hear petitions for writs of habeas corpus challenging the lawfulness of detention by state officials, even when that detention is purportedly based on federal authority. The court's role is to determine if the state official (the Sheriff) has the legal authority under state law to detain the individual.

2.  **ICE Detainers and Administrative Warrants:**
    *   **ICE Detainers (Form I-247A):** These are requests from ICE to state or local law enforcement agencies (LEAs) to hold an individual for up to 48 hours (excluding weekends and holidays) after they would otherwise be released, to allow ICE to take custody. They are *requests*, not mandates, and they are not judicial warrants. Many courts have held that ICE detainers alone do not provide independent legal authority for state or local LEAs to detain individuals beyond the point they would otherwise be released under state law, absent specific state statutory authority or a valid federal deputization that explicitly covers such detention.
    *   **Administrative Arrest Warrant (Form I-200):** This is an internal ICE document, issued by an immigration officer, not a federal judge or magistrate. It authorizes an immigration officer to arrest an individual for civil immigration violations. Like an ICE detainer, it is *not* a judicial warrant and generally does not provide state or local LEAs with independent authority to arrest or detain someone for civil immigration violations without specific state statutory authority or a valid federal deputization.

3.  **Lack of State Authority for Civil Immigration Enforcement:**
    *   **General Rule:** State and local law enforcement agencies generally lack inherent authority to enforce federal civil immigration law. Their authority is derived from state law, which typically does not authorize them to detain individuals solely for civil immigration violations.
    *   **The ""Probable Cause"" Argument:** While Maya argues the federal detainer lacks probable cause, a state court typically cannot review the merits of a federal immigration probable cause determination. However, the state court *can* and *should* review whether the *state official* (the Sheriff) has the *state law authority* to act on that federal detainer or administrative warrant.

4.  **The 287(g) Agreement:**
    *   **Purpose:** A 287(g) agreement authorizes *specifically trained* state or local officers to perform *certain, limited* federal immigration enforcement functions. It does not grant general immigration enforcement authority to the entire department or for all immigration violations.
    *   **Limitations:** Crucially, most 287(g) agreements (and judicial interpretations thereof) do *not* authorize state or local jails to hold individuals indefinitely or beyond the 48-hour detainer period *solely* on an ICE detainer or administrative warrant once state charges are resolved. The primary purpose of the detainer is to facilitate the *transfer* of the individual to ICE custody, not to transform a state jail into a federal immigration holding facility. Unless the specific 287(g) agreement explicitly grants the Sheriff's office authority to detain individuals *solely* on an ICE detainer or I-200 after state charges are resolved, and there is corresponding state law authorizing such detention, the continued detention is likely unlawful.

**Conclusion:**

Given that Maya has posted bond for her state misdemeanor charges, her continued detention by the Smith County Sheriff relies solely on the ICE detainer and administrative warrant. Absent specific state statutory authority or a provision within the 287(g) agreement that explicitly authorizes the Sheriff to detain individuals for civil immigration violations based *solely* on an ICE detainer or administrative warrant after state charges are resolved, the Sheriff's continued detention of Maya is likely unlawful under state law.

The state superior court's role in a habeas corpus proceeding is to ensure that state officials are acting within their legal authority. Since the Sheriff's office, despite the 287(g) agreement, likely lacks the state law authority to continue detaining Maya under these circumstances, the court should grant the writ of habeas corpus and order her discharge.",[],,0.8382001519203186,18.074180906511845,16.512375799960438

Furthermore, the plaintiffs did not establish they would suffer imminent irreparable injury, and the balance of equities and public interest did not favor imposing a broad, one-size-fits-all injunctive relief on the government's efforts to manage the immigration system while responding to the pandemic.","A U.S. federal court would **likely deny** the motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) in this scenario, though it would be a close call with significant arguments on both sides.

Here's an analysis based on the four factors for granting a TRO:

1.  **Likelihood of Success on the Merits:** This is the most challenging hurdle for the plaintiffs.
    *   **Administrative Procedure Act (APA):** Plaintiffs would argue the policies are arbitrary and capricious or were implemented without proper notice-and-comment rulemaking. However, agencies often have more leeway during public health emergencies, potentially invoking exceptions for ""good cause"" or ""interpretive rules."" The government would argue these are reasonable responses to an emergency, not arbitrary.
    *   **Immigration and Nationality Act (INA):** The INA guarantees a right to counsel (at no expense to the government) and a reasonable opportunity to present evidence. The policies don't eliminate these rights but alter the *mode* of their exercise. Courts generally defer to agency interpretations of their enabling statutes, especially during emergencies, as long as they are reasonable. The INA does not explicitly mandate *in-person* hearings.
    *   **Fifth Amendment Due Process:** This is the plaintiffs' strongest constitutional argument.
        *   **Liberty Interest:** Detained aliens facing deportation clearly have a significant liberty interest at stake.
        *   **Mathews v. Eldridge Factors:**
            *   **Private Interest:** The private interest of detained aliens in avoiding erroneous deportation and maintaining liberty is extremely high.
            *   **Risk of Erroneous Deprivation & Value of Additional Safeguards:** Plaintiffs would argue that remote hearings and restricted counsel access significantly increase the risk of erroneous decisions due to communication barriers, inability to present physical evidence effectively, and difficulty assessing demeanor.
            *   **Government Interest:** The government's interest in protecting public health during an emergency, ensuring the safety of its employees and the public, and maintaining the functionality of the immigration system is also extremely high.
        *   **Conclusion on Due Process:** While the private interest is high, courts grant significant deference to the executive branch during declared public health emergencies. The government would argue that the policies, while imperfect, are a necessary and reasonable accommodation to balance due process with public safety, and that alternatives (like video conferencing) still provide a meaningful opportunity to be heard. It's difficult to prove a *clear* constitutional violation that would warrant a TRO, especially when the government can articulate a strong public health justification.

2.  **Irreparable Harm:** This factor strongly favors the plaintiffs.
    *   Detained aliens face potential deportation, loss of liberty, separation from family, and other severe consequences if their hearings are unfair or delayed. These harms are immediate, substantial, and difficult to remedy after the fact.

3.  **Balance of Equities/Hardships:** This factor is mixed but likely leans slightly against the plaintiffs in the context of an emergency.
    *   **Hardship to Plaintiffs:** As noted, the hardship is severe (loss of liberty, deportation).
    *   **Hardship to Defendants/Government:** Granting a TRO would force EOIR and ICE to conduct in-person hearings and provide unrestricted access to counsel, potentially jeopardizing the health and safety of staff, judges, attorneys, and other detainees, and potentially overwhelming the system during a public health crisis. This could lead to further delays or a complete halt of proceedings, which also has negative consequences for detainees seeking resolution.

4.  **Public Interest:** This factor likely favors the government during a public health emergency.
    *   **Plaintiffs' Argument:** The public has an interest in upholding due process, ensuring fair hearings, and protecting fundamental rights.
    *   **Government's Argument:** The public has a paramount interest in controlling the spread of disease, protecting public health and safety, and ensuring the orderly and safe administration of justice, even during an emergency. Courts are generally reluctant to second-guess public health measures taken by the executive branch.

**Conclusion:**

While the plaintiffs present compelling arguments regarding irreparable harm and potential due process violations, the **likelihood of success on the merits** is the highest hurdle. Federal courts typically grant significant deference to executive agencies, especially during declared public health emergencies, regarding measures taken to protect public safety and maintain essential government functions. The government's strong interest in public health and safety, coupled with the argument that the policies are a reasonable (though perhaps imperfect) response to an unprecedented crisis, would likely outweigh the plaintiffs' claims for a TRO. The court might encourage the agencies to refine their policies or explore less restrictive alternatives, but a full injunction halting the policies is unlikely given the high bar for a TRO and the emergency context.",[],,0.8112574219703674,15.725552757491815,21.28675606480317
"A U.S. citizen was naturalized by a federal court in 1987 and received a naturalization certificate listing an incorrect birth date. After discovering the error years later, they sought to amend the certificate. Does a federal court have subject matter jurisdiction to modify such a naturalization certificate issued by a court before October 1, 1991, despite the Immigration Act of 1990 transferring naturalization authority to the Attorney General?","Yes, federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction to modify naturalization certificates issued by courts before the Immigration Act of 1990 went into effect on October 1, 1991. Congress preserved this jurisdiction through the uncodified savings clause of the Immigration Act of 1990, and federal courts can consider motions to amend these certificates pursuant to former 8 U.S.C. § 1451(i) (1988).",,,,,,,,"Yes, federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction to modify naturalization certificates issued by courts before the Immigration Act of 1990 went into effect on October 1, 1991. Congress preserved this jurisdiction through the uncodified savings clause of the Immigration Act of 1990, and federal courts can consider motions to amend these certificates pursuant to former 8 U.S.C. § 1451(i) (1988).","Yes, a federal court **does** have subject matter jurisdiction to modify a naturalization certificate it issued before October 1, 1991, to correct a clerical error such as an incorrect birth date.

Here's why:

1.  **Inherent Power of Courts to Correct Their Own Records:** Courts generally possess an inherent power to correct their own judgments and records to reflect the truth, especially when dealing with clerical errors, mistakes, or omissions. This power is also codified in rules like Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(a), which allows courts to correct ""clerical mistakes in judgments, orders, or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission... at any time.""

2.  **IMMACT90's Prospective Effect:** The Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT90) transferred the authority to naturalize individuals from federal courts to the Attorney General (and by delegation, USCIS) effective October 1, 1991. However, this transfer was **prospective**, meaning it applied to naturalization applications filed on or after that date. It did not retroactively strip federal courts of their jurisdiction over judgments they had already rendered or the records associated with those judgments.

3.  **Nature of the Original Act:** When the U.S. citizen was naturalized in 1987, it was a **judicial act**. The naturalization certificate issued by the federal court was a record of that court's judgment. The court that issued the original judgment retains jurisdiction to ensure the accuracy of its own records, particularly for clerical errors that do not challenge the underlying validity of the naturalization itself.

4.  **Distinction from New Naturalization Applications:** The Attorney General's (USCIS's) authority post-IMMACT90 pertains to processing *new* naturalization applications and correcting certificates issued *administratively* by USCIS. It does not divest the original federal court of its authority to correct its *own* judicial records.

Therefore, the federal court that issued the original naturalization certificate in 1987 would be the appropriate forum to hear a motion to amend that certificate to correct a clerical error like an incorrect birth date. The citizen would typically file a motion with that specific court, citing the clerical error and requesting an amendment to the court's record and the certificate.",[],,0.8380797505378723,15.327535714285716,24.133589285714294
"Can an in absentia removal order be rescinded if the initial Notice to Appear (NTA) did not specify the time and date of the immigration hearing, even if a separate Notice of Hearing (NOH) was later sent with that information?","Yes, an in absentia removal order may be rescinded if the initial Notice to Appear did not contain the time and date of the hearing. The Supreme Court's interpretation of 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a) requires a single written notice containing all the required information, including the time and place of the hearing. Therefore, a Notice to Appear that lacks this information cannot be cured by a subsequent Notice of Hearing in the context of rescinding an in absentia removal order.",,,,,,,,"Yes, an in absentia removal order may be rescinded if the initial Notice to Appear did not contain the time and date of the hearing.

Therefore, a Notice to Appear that lacks this information cannot be cured by a subsequent Notice of Hearing in the context of rescinding an in absentia removal order.","Yes, an in absentia removal order *can* be rescinded under these circumstances, and this has become a significant area of litigation following recent Supreme Court decisions.

Here's a breakdown of why:

1.  **Statutory Requirement for a Notice to Appear (NTA):**
    *   Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) Section 239(a)(1) specifies what information must be included in a Notice to Appear (NTA). Crucially, it requires the NTA to include ""the time and place at which the proceedings will be held.""

2.  **The Impact of *Pereira v. Sessions* (2018) and *Niz-Chavez v. Garland* (2021):**
    *   **Pereira v. Sessions (2018):** The Supreme Court held that an NTA that does not specify the time and date of the initial hearing is not a ""notice to appear"" for purposes of the ""stop-time rule"" for cancellation of removal. While this case was about the stop-time rule, it emphasized the statutory requirement for the time and date to be in the NTA itself.
    *   **Niz-Chavez v. Garland (2021):** Building on *Pereira*, the Supreme Court clarified that *all* the information required by INA 239(a)(1), including the time and date, must be provided in *a single document* to constitute a ""notice to appear"" for the stop-time rule. It rejected the government's argument that a later Notice of Hearing (NOH) could ""cure"" a defective NTA.

3.  **Application to In Absentia Orders:**
    *   INA 240(b)(5)(C) allows for the rescission of an in absentia order if the alien ""did not receive notice in accordance with paragraph (1) or (2) of section 239(a) of this title.""
    *   The argument is that if the initial NTA did not contain the time and date, it was not a ""notice in accordance with paragraph (1) of section 239(a).""
    *   Many courts, including the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) in *Matter of Mendoza-Hernandez* (2021) and various Circuit Courts, have extended the reasoning of *Pereira* and *Niz-Chavez* to the context of in absentia orders and the Immigration Judge's jurisdiction. They have held that an NTA lacking the time and date is fundamentally defective, and a later NOH, while providing the missing information, does not retroactively make the initial NTA compliant with the statute for the purpose of establishing proper notice for an in absentia order.

**Conclusion:**

Therefore, if the initial NTA did not specify the time and date of the immigration hearing, even if a separate NOH was later sent with that information, an in absentia removal order *can* be rescinded. The legal basis is that the alien did not receive proper notice ""in accordance with"" INA 239(a)(1) because the foundational document (the NTA) was statutorily deficient from the outset.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Legal Argument:** This is a legal argument that must be presented to the Immigration Court or BIA. It's not an automatic rescission.
*   **Actual Receipt of NOH:** While the NTA's defect is key, if the alien *never* received the NOH either, that would be an additional, strong ground for rescission based on lack of actual notice.
*   **Jurisdiction:** While the trend is clear, specific circuit court precedents can sometimes influence outcomes, though the Supreme Court's rulings are binding.
*   **Legal Counsel:** Anyone in this situation should seek advice from an experienced immigration attorney.",[],,0.8395125865936279,13.272098646034816,41.7643181818182

Section 13-3407 of the Arizona Revised Statutes, which criminalizes possession of a dangerous drug, is divisible with regard to the specific ""dangerous drug"" involved in a violation. Since fentanyl is a federally controlled substance, a conviction for attempted possession of fentanyl for sale under section 13-3407 renders an alien removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony illicit trafficking offense and a controlled substance violation under sections 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) and (B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, respectively.",,,,,,,,"Yes, Juan is removable.

Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Removable as an Alien Convicted of a Controlled Substance Violation (INA 237(a)(2)(B)(i)):**
    *   **Law:** Section 237(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) states that any alien who has been convicted of a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802)), other than a single offense involving possession for one's own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana, is deportable.
    *   **Application:**
        *   Juan was convicted of attempted possession of fentanyl for sale in Arizona.
        *   Fentanyl is a federally controlled substance (Schedule II).
        *   ""Attempted possession for sale"" is clearly a violation relating to a controlled substance.
        *   There is no exception for this type of offense (the only exception is for a small amount of marijuana for personal use).
    *   **Conclusion:** Juan is removable under INA 237(a)(2)(B)(i).

2.  **Removable as an Alien Convicted of an Aggravated Felony (INA 101(a)(43)(B)):**
    *   **Law:** Section 101(a)(43)(B) of the INA defines an ""aggravated felony"" to include ""illicit trafficking in a controlled substance (as described in section 802 of title 21), including a drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18).""
    *   **Application:**
        *   The Supreme Court in *Lopez v. Gonzales*, 549 U.S. 47 (2006), clarified that ""illicit trafficking in a controlled substance"" refers to offenses that are felonies under federal drug law.
        *   Arizona Revised Statutes section 13-3407, ""possession for sale"" of a controlled substance like fentanyl, is generally considered to be the state equivalent of ""possession with intent to distribute"" under federal law (21 U.S.C. 841(a)(1)).
        *   Possession with intent to distribute fentanyl is a federal felony drug offense (21 U.S.C. 841(b)). Attempted offenses are also covered.
        *   Therefore, Juan's conviction for attempted possession of fentanyl for sale qualifies as ""illicit trafficking in a controlled substance"" because the state offense corresponds to a federal felony drug offense.
    *   **Conclusion:** Juan is removable under INA 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.

**Summary:**

Juan's conviction for attempted possession of fentanyl for sale makes him removable under U.S. immigration law on two distinct grounds: as a controlled substance violator and as an aggravated felon. The aggravated felony designation carries particularly severe consequences, including mandatory detention and significant bars to various forms of relief from removal.",[],,0.8240063190460205,13.557085811384876,32.515739167374704
"An alien investor obtained $500,000 via a personal loan from a third-party, which was then wired to their personal account, converted to U.S. currency, and invested as cash into a new commercial enterprise for an EB-5 visa petition. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) denied the petition, asserting that the invested cash loan proceeds constituted ""indebtedness"" under 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e) and required collateralization by personal assets, which the investor failed to demonstrate. The investor challenges this denial. Based on the ruling in Case_zhang_v_united_states_citizenship_and_immigration_services, should the investor's petition be denied on these grounds?","No, the investor's petition should not be denied on these grounds. The court found that USCIS's interpretation of 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e)—that third-party loan proceeds invested as cash are properly characterized as ""indebtedness"" requiring personal collateralization—is plainly erroneous. The regulation unambiguously defines ""capital"" to include ""cash,"" and the ordinary meaning of ""cash"" encompasses cash loan proceeds. The court clarified that the regulation directs the agency to identify the asset *actually contributed* to the enterprise, which in this scenario is cash. The collateralization requirement for ""indebtedness"" only applies when the investor contributes a promise to pay (indebtedness to the enterprise itself), not when the enterprise receives readily deployable cash. Furthermore, USCIS's interpretation effectively amends the regulation by adding a new requirement for cash investments without proper notice and comment, thus violating the Administrative Procedure Act. Therefore, USCIS's denial of such petitions is arbitrary and capricious, and the denials should be vacated and remanded for reconsideration consistent with this understanding.",,,,,,,,"No, the investor's petition should not be denied on these grounds.

United States Citizenship and Immigration Services*, the investor's petition **should not be denied on these grounds.**

Here's why:

1.  **Clarification of ""Indebtedness"" as Capital:** The *Zhang* ruling specifically addressed and rejected USCIS's interpretation that cash proceeds from a personal loan, when invested into a new commercial enterprise (NCE), constitute ""indebtedness"" under 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e) requiring collateralization by personal assets.
2.  **Cash is Cash:** The court clarified that when an investor obtains a personal loan, receives the funds as cash, and then invests *that cash* into the NCE, the investment itself is considered **cash**, not ""indebtedness."" The source of the cash (a loan) is relevant for demonstrating a lawful source of funds, but it does not transform the nature of the investment from cash into ""indebtedness"" for the purpose of the collateralization requirement.
3.  **Collateralization Requirement:** The collateralization requirement under 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e) applies when the *indebtedness itself* (e.g., a promissory note from the investor to the NCE) is invested as capital. It does not apply when the *cash proceeds* of a loan are invested.
4.  **USCIS's Error:** In this scenario, USCIS's assertion that the ""invested cash loan proceeds constituted 'indebtedness'"" and therefore required collateralization by personal assets directly contradicts the *Zhang* ruling. The investor invested cash, not a debt instrument.

Therefore, while the investor would still need to demonstrate that the loan was obtained through lawful means and that they have the ability to repay it (to satisfy the ""lawful source of funds"" requirement), the specific denial reason cited by USCIS regarding the cash loan proceeds being ""indebtedness"" requiring collateralization is inconsistent with the *Zhang* precedent.",[],,0.8600667715072632,13.280934065934069,34.57656593406597

Here's why:

1.  **Continuous Physical Presence (CPP) Requirement:** A core eligibility requirement for TPS is that the applicant must have been continuously physically present in the United States since a specific date designated for their country.
2.  **""Brief, Casual, and Innocent"" Exception:** The law allows for *brief, casual, and innocent* departures from the U.S. without breaking continuous physical presence.
    *   **""Brief"":** This generally refers to short periods of absence.

    *   **""Casual and Innocent"":** Visiting a sick parent would generally be considered an ""innocent"" purpose. ""Casual"" means it wasn't pre-planned for an immigration benefit or to evade immigration laws.
3.  **The Crucial Determination by Authorities:** The most critical part of your question is that immigration authorities have *already deemed* the absence not to be ""of short duration"" or ""reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose.""

    *   The court's role is limited. It must determine if the AAO's decision was rational, based on the evidence presented, and in accordance with the law. It's not to grant *de novo* review or to be sympathetic to the petitioner's difficulties if those difficulties prevent her from meeting the legal requirements.
    *   The petitioner bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the funds were lawfully gained and that the entire path of funds to the U.S. investment can be clearly documented. For EB-5, USCIS often requires ""clear and convincing"" evidence regarding the lawful source and path of funds due to anti-money laundering concerns.

2.  **Insufficient Documentation of the Complete Path of Funds:**
    *   **AAO's Position:** The AAO requires a clear and verifiable ""path of funds"" from the petitioner's personal lawful source to the U.S. investment. This is a fundamental requirement to prevent money laundering and ensure the funds are legitimate.
    *   **Petitioner's Evidence:** The petitioner explains the use of third-party trading companies in Dubai due to sanctions and provides an affidavit. However, she *cannot provide direct wire transfer records from her Iranian bank account to the Dubai entities* nor *written statements from the individuals who facilitated the transfers*.
    *   **Court's Analysis:** The AAO's demand for documentation of the complete path of funds is entirely consistent with EB-5 regulations and policy. While the petitioner's explanation regarding sanctions and the use of third parties is understandable, it does not relieve her of the burden to *document* the transfers. An affidavit, while providing an explanation, is generally considered secondary evidence and is insufficient on its own to establish the lawful path of funds when primary documentary evidence (like bank statements, wire transfers, or verifiable receipts from the intermediaries) is missing, especially for substantial sums. The inability to obtain statements from the facilitators further weakens her claim, as these individuals would be key to corroborating the transfers. The AAO's finding that the path of funds is not sufficiently documented is a reasonable exercise of its discretion and is not arbitrary or capricious.

3.  **Currency Discrepancy in the Gold Coin Sale Invoice:**
    *   **AAO's Position:** Discrepancies in key financial documents raise doubts about the authenticity and accuracy of the claimed source of funds.
    *   **Petitioner's Evidence:** An invoice for the gold coin sale has a discrepancy between ""tomans"" and ""rials"" for the total amount.
    *   **Court's Analysis:** The AAO is entitled to scrutinize all documentation provided to verify the lawful source of funds. A discrepancy in a primary source document, such as an invoice for a significant portion of the investment capital, directly undermines the credibility and reliability of that evidence. Even if it's a simple error or a colloquial usage, it creates ambiguity that the petitioner failed to adequately resolve with clear, corroborating evidence. The AAO's concern about such a discrepancy is reasonable and falls squarely within its mandate to ensure the legitimacy of the funds. This finding is not an abuse of discretion.

**Conclusion:**

The AAO's denial was based on two distinct but related failures by the petitioner to meet her burden of proof regarding the lawful source and path of funds. Both reasons are well-established requirements in EB-5 adjudication. The petitioner's inability to provide verifiable documentation for the transfers from Iran to Dubai, coupled with a significant discrepancy in a key source-of-funds document, provides a rational and legally sound basis for the AAO's decision.

Therefore, the U.S. District Court should **uphold the AAO's denial** because the AAO's decision was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise contrary to law. The petitioner failed to meet her burden of proof to establish eligibility for the EB-5 visa.",[],,0.840873658657074,13.757395902181102,33.727458691341724
"A foreign investor seeks an EB-5 visa through a regional center, proposing to invest $500,000 in a new commercial enterprise (NCE) that will loan funds to multiple job-creating entities (JCEs) for various mining projects in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA). At the time of filing the Form I-526 petition, the investor's business plan and offering memorandum list four potential mining locations, but explicitly state that not all have been formally approved, and alternative or additional projects are unspecified and unapproved if initial projects fall through or require less funding. The plan includes an economic report projecting job creation based on mining expenditures but without specific JCE locations. USCIS denies the petition, citing failure to establish TEA qualification and job creation at the time of filing, and views subsequent clarification of JCE locations as an impermissible material change. Can the investor successfully challenge this denial, arguing that the NCE was clearly intended to operate in a TEA and that their economic report adequately demonstrated job creation potential, irrespective of specific JCE locations at filing?","No, the investor cannot successfully challenge the denial. A U.S. District Court has upheld USCIS's denial of similar EB-5 visa petitions on two independent grounds: (1) failure to establish that the Job Creating Entities (JCEs) were principally doing business in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA) at the time of filing, and (2) failure to establish that the investments would create full-time positions for at least ten qualifying employees at the time of filing. For regional center investments, the ""principally doing business"" requirement applies to the JCEs, not the New Commercial Enterprise (NCE). The Court found it reasonable for USCIS to conclude that the investor failed to meet the TEA requirement because the JCEs were not fully identified or approved at the time of filing, making it impossible to determine if the $500,000 TEA investment threshold was met. Furthermore, changes to JCE locations after filing were deemed impermissible material changes affecting eligibility. Regarding job creation, the Court found that the initial business plan, lacking specified JCE locations, was not sufficiently comprehensive to support a credible economic analysis for prospective job creation at the time of filing. USCIS could not assess the reasonableness of assumptions about the geographic impact of projects without this information. Subsequent economic reports based on later-identified JCEs were also rejected due to the material change doctrine, which requires eligibility to be established at the time of filing.",,,,,,,,"No, the investor cannot successfully challenge the denial.

Subsequent economic reports based on later-identified JCEs were also rejected due to the material change doctrine, which requires eligibility to be established at the time of filing.","It is **highly unlikely** that the investor could successfully challenge this denial. USCIS's denial is consistent with established EB-5 adjudication principles, particularly the requirement that all eligibility criteria be met and demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence *at the time of filing* the Form I-526 petition.

Here's a breakdown of why the investor's arguments would likely fail:

1.  **""At the Time of Filing"" Requirement is Paramount:**
    *   USCIS rigorously applies the ""at the time of filing"" rule for I-526 petitions. This means the investor must present a comprehensive, credible, and verifiable business plan and supporting documentation that clearly establishes all eligibility requirements *as of the date the petition is submitted*.
    *   **TEA Qualification:** For an investment to qualify for the lower $500,000 threshold, the job-creating entity (JCE) must be principally doing business in a designated TEA. If the specific locations of the JCEs are ""unspecified and unapproved"" at the time of filing, USCIS has no basis to verify that the jobs will, in fact, be created within a TEA. ""Intended to operate in a TEA"" is insufficient; specific, verifiable locations are required.
    *   **Job Creation:** Economic methodologies used by regional centers to project indirect job creation rely on specific inputs, including the industry, investment amount, and critically, the *geographic location* of the job-creating activity. Different regions have different economic multipliers. An economic report projecting jobs ""without specific JCE locations"" is inherently speculative and lacks the necessary specificity for USCIS to deem it credible and verifiable. USCIS requires a *demonstrated* ability to create jobs, not just a *potential* or *hypothetical* ability.

2.  **Material Change Doctrine:**
    *   USCIS's view that subsequent clarification of JCE locations constitutes an ""impermissible material change"" is a strong point against the investor. The material change doctrine prevents petitioners from fundamentally altering the nature of their investment project after filing the I-526.
    *   If the initial petition lacked crucial details like specific JCE locations and confirmed TEA status, providing these details later is essentially presenting a *new* project for adjudication. USCIS would argue that the original petition was deficient from the outset, and the subsequent information cannot retroactively cure those deficiencies. The core elements of *where* the jobs will be created and *where* the TEA designation applies were missing.

3.  **Lack of Specificity and Verifiability:**
    *   The business plan's statement that ""not all [locations] have been formally approved, and alternative or additional projects are unspecified and unapproved"" directly undermines the required level of specificity. USCIS needs to be able to verify the claims made in the petition. Without confirmed locations, the agency cannot verify TEA status or the accuracy of job creation projections.

**Conclusion:**

The investor's arguments, while appealing to intent and potential, fall short of the strict evidentiary standards required for EB-5 petitions. USCIS requires concrete, verifiable evidence of TEA qualification and job creation at the time of filing. The lack of specific, approved JCE locations renders both the TEA claim and the job creation projections speculative and unverifiable. The subsequent attempt to clarify these details would be correctly viewed as an impermissible material change, as it fundamentally alters the basis upon which the original petition was filed. Therefore, the investor would face significant difficulty in successfully challenging this denial.",[],,0.849836528301239,16.135057575757575,16.999336363636388

While the condition ""no investor applicant has yet been subjected to its application"" presents a significant hurdle, a federal court *could* review such a challenge, especially if the challenge is framed correctly and brought by the appropriate parties.

Here's a breakdown of the arguments for and against review:

**Arguments Against Review (Lack of Ripeness/Standing):**

1.  **Lack of Concrete Injury (for individual investors):** For an individual investor, a court might find that without an actual denial or adverse decision based on the new policy, there is no concrete ""injury-in-fact."" The harm is speculative or hypothetical. Courts generally prefer to wait until a policy has been applied in a specific case to see its actual impact.
2.  **Lack of Ripeness:** The issue might not be ""ripe"" for judicial review. Ripeness requires that the dispute be sufficiently developed and not based on contingent future events. If USCIS hasn't yet applied the policy, the court might want to see how it's actually implemented and interpreted before intervening.

**Arguments For Review (Overcoming Ripeness/Standing Challenges):**

1.  **Final Agency Action:** The USCIS Policy Manual update *is* a final agency action. Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), challenges to final agency actions are generally reviewable. The update represents a definitive statement of USCIS's position and policy.
2.  **Challenge to the Legality of the Rule Itself:** The challenge might not be about a specific application, but rather the *legality* of the policy itself. For example, plaintiffs could argue that:
    *   The policy exceeds USCIS's statutory authority (ultra vires).
    *   The policy was promulgated without proper notice-and-comment rulemaking (if required for such a significant change).
    *   The policy is arbitrary and capricious, or not a reasonable interpretation of the underlying statute.
    *   In such cases, the harm is the existence of an unlawful policy, not necessarily its specific application to an individual.
3.  **Immediate Harm to Regional Centers/Developers/Industry Associations:** While individual investors might struggle to show immediate harm, **EB-5 regional centers, developers, or industry associations** could argue that the mere existence of the new geographic redeployment requirement causes them immediate and concrete harm by:
    *   **Chilling Effect:** Deterring potential investors from participating in EB-5 projects, making it harder to raise capital.
    *   **Increased Costs/Uncertainty:** Requiring them to restructure projects, incur legal fees, or face significant uncertainty that impacts their business operations and investment decisions *now*.
    *   This ""chilling effect"" or immediate economic impact on regulated entities is often sufficient to establish standing and ripeness for a pre-enforcement challenge to a regulation or policy.
4.  **Hardship to the Parties:** Waiting for an actual investor to be denied under the new policy could take years, causing significant and irreparable harm to the EB-5 industry and potential investors. This ""hardship to the parties"" factor weighs in favor of ripeness.

**Conclusion:**

Yes, a federal court *could* review such a challenge, but it would likely depend on:

*   **Who brings the challenge:** Regional centers, developers, or industry associations have a stronger argument for immediate harm than individual investors who haven't yet applied or been denied.
*   **The nature of the challenge:** A challenge to the *legality* or *procedural validity* of the policy itself (e.g., exceeding authority, arbitrary and capricious, lack of proper rulemaking) is more likely to be heard than a challenge to a hypothetical future application.
*   **The ability to demonstrate immediate, concrete harm:** Even without a specific denial, plaintiffs would need to show how the policy's existence is causing them present injury (e.g., lost investment, increased costs, business uncertainty).

In essence, while the ""no one subjected yet"" condition makes it a tougher case, the ability to demonstrate a ""final agency action"" and ""immediate harm"" to regulated entities (like regional centers) through a ""chilling effect"" or direct impact on business operations often allows for pre-enforcement judicial review of agency policies.",[],,0.813607931137085,15.602834051724141,22.505312500000002
"Nikunj Devani, a citizen of India, filed an EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program petition (Form I-526) in October 2019, which USCIS has yet to process. He alleges unreasonable delay, seeking to compel USCIS to adjudicate his petition, despite USCIS's visa availability approach and a 9-month lapse in the Regional Center Program's authorization. Will the court compel USCIS to expedite processing of his I-526 petition, considering the TRAC factors for unreasonable delay?","No, the court will dismiss Devani's action, denying his request to compel USCIS to process his I-526 petition. The court found that Devani failed to state a plausible claim of unreasonable delay under the TRAC factors.
1.  **Rule of Reason & Congressional Timetable:** USCIS's visa availability approach, which processes petitions on a modified ""first-in, first-out"" basis prioritizing petitioners from countries below visa caps, constitutes a rule of reason. Congress has not mandated a binding timeline for I-526 processing; the ""sense of Congress"" resolution is merely hortatory. The effective 32-month delay (accounting for a 9-month lapse in statutory authority) is not unreasonable, especially compared to the current average 52-month processing time for Indian applicants.
2.  **Prejudice to Health, Welfare, and Other Interests:** Devani's alleged financial and immigration-related harms (uncertainty) are considered inherent risks of the I-526 application process and do not rise to the level of harm, such as significant threats to physical health or safety, typically warranting intervention under these factors.
3.  **Agency's Competing Priorities:** Granting relief would require USCIS to reorder its priorities, placing Devani ahead of other similarly situated petitioners in the existing backlog, which the court is hesitant to do.
4.  **Impropriety:** Devani did not plausibly allege any facts of impropriety by USCIS. The 9-month pause in processing was due to a lapse in statutory authorization, not agency misconduct.",,,,,,,,"No, the court will dismiss Devani's action, denying his request to compel USCIS to process his I-526 petition.

4.  **Impropriety:** Devani did not plausibly allege any facts of impropriety by USCIS. The 9-month pause in processing was due to a lapse in statutory authorization, not agency misconduct.","This is a complex question that requires balancing the petitioner's right to timely adjudication against USCIS's operational realities and legal constraints. Applying the TRAC factors for unreasonable delay, it is **unlikely** that the court will compel USCIS to *expedite* processing of Nikunj Devani's I-526 petition, though it might compel adjudication within a general timeframe.

Here's an analysis based on the TRAC factors:

1.  **The Time Agencies Take to Make Decisions:**
    *   **For Devani:** Filing in October 2019 and still awaiting processing in late 2023/early 2024 (over 4 years) is a significant delay, especially given that USCIS publishes target processing times (though these are not statutory deadlines). This factor weighs in favor of finding unreasonable delay.
    *   **Against Devani (USCIS's defense):** USCIS will argue that a substantial portion of this delay was due to the lapse in the Regional Center Program's authorization. For approximately 9-12 months (March 2021 to March 2022), USCIS was legally prohibited from adjudicating Regional Center I-526 petitions. This period effectively ""pauses"" the clock for a significant portion of the overall delay.

2.  **The Reasonableness of the Delay in the Context of the Statute's Mandate:**
    *   **For Devani:** The EB-5 program is designed to attract investment, and such long delays undermine its purpose and tie up significant capital.
    *   **Against Devani (USCIS's defense):** The 9-month lapse in the Regional Center Program's authorization is a critical factor. USCIS was legally unable to process these petitions during that time. Once reauthorized, USCIS had to re-establish processing protocols and deal with a backlog that accumulated during the lapse. USCIS also has a general discretion in prioritizing petitions, often focusing on those where a visa is immediately available or those filed earlier.

3.  **The Consequences of the Delay for the Petitioners:**
    *   **For Devani:** The consequences are significant. His substantial investment is tied up, his immigration future is uncertain, and he cannot proceed to the next stage (I-485 adjustment of status or consular processing) without an approved I-526. This factor weighs strongly in favor of Devani.

4.  **Any Other Remedies Available to the Petitioner:**
    *   **For Devani:** There are no other administrative remedies available to compel USCIS to adjudicate an I-526 petition. A mandamus action (under the APA) is the only recourse. This factor weighs strongly in favor of Devani.

5.  **The Public Interest:**
    *   **Neutral/Mixed:** While there's a public interest in efficient government processing, there's also a public interest in agencies following legal mandates (like not processing petitions during a program lapse) and managing their resources effectively.

**Conclusion:**

While Nikunj Devani has a strong argument regarding the length and impact of the delay, the **9-month lapse in the Regional Center Program's authorization is a critical impediment to his case for *expedited* processing.** USCIS can legitimately argue that it was legally barred from processing his petition for a significant portion of the overall delay.

Courts are generally reluctant to compel an agency to *expedite* processing unless the delay is truly egregious and without a legitimate explanation. The Regional Center lapse provides USCIS with a very strong, legally sound explanation for a substantial part of the delay.

Therefore, while the court might acknowledge the overall length of the delay and potentially compel USCIS to adjudicate the petition within a *reasonable timeframe* (e.g., within the next 6-12 months, rather than indefinitely), it is **unlikely to compel USCIS to *expedite* processing ahead of other similarly situated petitioners who also faced the program lapse and are now in the queue.** USCIS would likely be given deference to process these petitions in a systematic order following the program's reauthorization.

The ""visa availability approach"" is less relevant for the I-526 stage itself, as I-526 approval is a prerequisite for applying for a visa, regardless of current availability. However, USCIS might use it as a secondary argument to suggest that even with I-526 approval, Devani would still face a long wait for a visa due to retrogression for Indian citizens, thus mitigating the *immediate* harm of the I-526 delay in terms of final immigration benefit.",[],,0.8448548913002014,15.010198315106486,27.921138088012157

Here's a breakdown of the legal obligations under the I-864 Affidavit of Support, including household size and income calculations, and the remedies available for the loan and attorney's fees.

---

### I. Legal Obligations Under the USCIS Form I-864 Affidavit of Support

The Form I-864 Affidavit of Support is a legally binding contract between the sponsor and the U.S. government, enforceable by the sponsored immigrant. Its purpose is to ensure that the immigrant will not become a public charge in the U.S.

**A. Nature and Duration of the Obligation:**

1.  **Legally Binding Contract:** The I-864 is a legally enforceable contract. The sponsor promises to provide financial support to the sponsored immigrant.
2.  **Separation/Divorce Does NOT Terminate:** Crucially, the sponsor's obligation under the I-864 **does not terminate upon separation or divorce**. This is a common misconception. The obligation continues regardless of the marital status of the parties.
3.  **Termination Events:** The obligation generally terminates only when the sponsored immigrant:
    *   Becomes a U.S. citizen.
    *   Has worked or can be credited with 40 quarters of coverage under the Social Security Act (usually 10 years).
    *   Departs the United States permanently.
    *   Dies.
    *   Becomes subject to removal proceedings, but only if the sponsor's obligation is not the basis for the proceedings.

**B. Scope of Support:**

The sponsor's primary obligation is to maintain the sponsored immigrant at an annual income that is at least **125% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG)** for their household size. This means the sponsor must provide financial support to ensure the immigrant's total income (including their own earnings, if any) meets this threshold.

**C. Enforcement:**

The sponsored immigrant can sue the sponsor in federal or state court to enforce the Affidavit of Support.

### II. Relevant Household Size and Income Calculations for I-864 Enforcement

When enforcing the I-864, the calculations differ slightly from when the form was initially filed.

**A. The 125% Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG) Threshold:**

*   The core obligation is to ensure the immigrant's income reaches 125% of the FPG.
*   The specific FPG figures are published annually by the Department of Health and Human Services. The relevant FPG will be the one in effect at the time the support is sought.

**B. Household Size for Enforcement:**

For the purpose of calculating the sponsor's obligation during enforcement, the ""household size"" includes:

1.  **The Sponsor:** The U.S. citizen who signed the I-864.
2.  **The Sponsored Immigrant:** The spouse seeking support.
3.  **Any Dependent Children of the Sponsored Immigrant:** If they reside with the sponsored immigrant.
4.  **Any Other Dependents of the Sponsor:** As claimed on the sponsor's most recent tax return.
5.  **Any Other Individuals the Sponsor Has Sponsored:** Through other I-864s that are still in effect.

**Example:** If the sponsor and immigrant are separated, but the immigrant is still considered part of the sponsor's ""household"" for I-864 purposes. If the immigrant has no other dependents, the household size for calculating the 125% FPG threshold would be at least two (sponsor + immigrant). If the immigrant has a child living with them, the household size would be at least three.

**C. Income Calculation for Enforcement:**

1.  **Sponsor's Obligation:** The sponsor is obligated to provide support to bring the immigrant's income up to 125% of the FPG.
2.  **Immigrant's Income:** The immigrant's own income (from employment, benefits, etc.) is subtracted from the 125% FPG threshold. The sponsor is then responsible for the difference.
3.  **No Reduction for Sponsor's Financial Hardship:** The sponsor's own financial difficulties or inability to pay generally do not excuse the obligation. The I-864 is a strict liability contract.

### III. Remedies for Breach of the I-864 Affidavit of Support

If the sponsor breaches the I-864, the immigrant spouse can seek the following remedies:

1.  **Damages:** The most common remedy. The court will order the sponsor to pay the difference between the immigrant's actual income (or lack thereof) and 125% of the FPG for their household size. This can be calculated retroactively from the date the support obligation was breached.
2.  **Specific Performance:** A court could order the sponsor to make ongoing payments to the immigrant to ensure they meet the 125% FPG threshold.
3.  **Attorney's Fees and Costs:** This is a critical aspect of I-864 enforcement. Federal law (8 U.S.C. § 1183a(c)) explicitly states that a court **shall** award the sponsored immigrant their costs and reasonable attorney's fees if they prevail in an action to enforce the Affidavit of Support. This provision is a significant incentive for sponsors to comply and for immigrants to pursue their claims.

### IV. Repayment of a Personal Loan

The claim for repayment of a personal loan is separate from the I-864 Affidavit of Support.

**A. Nature of the Claim:** This is a contract claim (or potentially unjust enrichment). The immigrant spouse would need to prove:

1.  **Existence of a Loan:** That a loan was made (money was given with the expectation of repayment, not a gift).
2.  **Terms of the Loan:** The amount, any agreed-upon interest rate, and the repayment schedule.
3.  **Breach:** That the sponsor failed to repay the loan according to the agreed-upon terms.

**B. Evidence:** Proof can include written loan agreements, promissory notes, bank statements showing transfers, emails, text messages, or witness testimony.

**C. Remedies:** If successful, the immigrant spouse would be entitled to:

1.  **Repayment of the Principal:** The original amount of the loan.
2.  **Interest:** If an interest rate was agreed upon, or if state law allows for statutory interest on unpaid debts.

### V. Attorney's Fees for the Loan Claim

Unlike the I-864 claim, attorney's fees for a personal loan claim are generally not automatically awarded under the ""American Rule,"" where each party pays their own legal fees. However, exceptions exist:

1.  **Contractual Provision:** If the loan agreement (written or clearly established oral terms) explicitly included a clause stating that the borrower would pay the lender's attorney's fees in case of default or collection, then fees could be recovered.
2.  **Statutory Provision:** Some state laws may allow for attorney's fees in certain types of debt collection cases, but this is less common for informal personal loans.
3.  **Bad Faith/Frivolous Litigation:** If the sponsor's defense to the loan claim is found to be frivolous or in bad faith, a court *might* award fees, but this is rare and difficult to prove.

**In summary:**

*   The sponsor's obligation under the I-864 is **legally binding and continues despite separation or divorce**. The immigrant spouse can sue for damages (the difference between their income and 125% FPG) and **will be awarded attorney's fees** if they prevail on this claim.
*   The personal loan is a **separate contractual claim**. The immigrant must prove the loan existed and was breached. Remedies include repayment of the principal and potentially interest. Attorney's fees for the loan claim are **not automatic** and generally require a specific agreement or statutory basis.

It is highly advisable for the immigrant spouse to consult with an attorney experienced in I-864 enforcement and contract law to assess the specific facts and available evidence.",[],,0.8113526701927185,10.709064039408869,47.79948275862071
"A Canadian resident, identifying as Native American/First Nations, applies for U.S. citizenship, but their application is rejected by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) due to incomplete forms. The individual then asks a U.S. federal district court to directly grant them citizenship, citing Section 289 of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. Can the federal court fulfill this request?","No, a U.S. federal district court cannot grant citizenship. Federal courts lack the power to confer citizenship, as this authority rests with Congress alone to prescribe rules for naturalization. Therefore, the court would dismiss a complaint seeking such relief.",,,,,,,,"No, a U.S. federal district court cannot grant citizenship. Federal courts lack the power to confer citizenship, as this authority rests with Congress alone to prescribe rules for naturalization. Therefore, the court would dismiss a complaint seeking such relief.","No, the U.S. federal district court cannot fulfill this request to directly grant citizenship. Here's why:

1.  **Misinterpretation of Section 289 of the INA:**
    *   **What Section 289 (8 U.S.C. § 1359) *does*:** This section states that ""American Indians born in Canada, who have at least 50 per centum of blood of the American Indian race, shall be entitled to pass the borders of the United States, but shall be subject to all other provisions of this chapter and subchapter II of chapter 4 of this title not inconsistent with this proviso."" It grants eligible individuals the right to freely enter and reside in the U.S. without being subject to certain immigration restrictions (like visa requirements or numerical quotas).
    *   **What Section 289 *does not* do:** It **does not grant U.S. citizenship**. While it provides significant immigration benefits and a unique status, it does not automatically confer U.S. citizenship. Individuals benefiting from Section 289 are still considered non-citizens unless they acquire citizenship through other means (e.g., naturalization).

2.  **Court's Role in Naturalization:**
    *   **Administrative Process:** The process of naturalization (acquiring U.S. citizenship) is primarily an administrative function handled by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). USCIS receives applications, conducts interviews, performs background checks, and makes the initial determination of eligibility.
    *   **Judicial Review, Not Initial Grant:** Federal courts generally have the authority to review a *final denial* of a naturalization application by USCIS, or to administer the oath of allegiance. However, they do not have the authority to *directly grant* citizenship in the first instance, bypassing the entire administrative process.
    *   **Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:** A fundamental principle of administrative law is that individuals must generally exhaust all available administrative remedies before seeking judicial intervention. In this case, the application was rejected due to *incomplete forms*, meaning the administrative process was not even properly initiated or completed.

**Conclusion:**

The federal court cannot directly grant the individual citizenship based on Section 289 because that section does not confer citizenship, only certain immigration benefits. Furthermore, the court's role is typically to review final administrative decisions, not to make initial determinations of citizenship, especially when the administrative application process was not even completed properly. The individual's proper course of action is to complete and resubmit their naturalization application to USCIS.",[],,0.8286004662513733,15.249865229110515,17.1949775381851

Garland*, the petitions for asylum and related relief would likely face significant challenges and would **not likely be granted in their entirety as presented.**

Here's a breakdown of how *Bustamante-Leiva* would apply to each aspect of their claim:

1.  **Proposed Particular Social Group (PSG):**
    *   The proposed PSG, ""unprotected Honduran women who are unable to protect themselves or their children from Honduran gangs,"" is **identical** to the PSG rejected by the Ninth Circuit in *Bustamante-Leiva*.
    *   The court in *Bustamante-Leiva* found this PSG to be too amorphous, defined by the persecution itself, and lacking the requisite social visibility and particularity under established precedent (e.g., *Matter of M-E-V-G-* and *Matter of W-G-R-*).
    *   **Conclusion:** This PSG claim would almost certainly be **denied**.

2.  **Religious Activities Claim:**
    *   In *Bustamante-Leiva*, the Ninth Circuit found that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) had **erred** in its analysis of the petitioner's religious persecution claim, often remanding for a proper assessment of whether the petitioner's religious activities were a central reason for the persecution.
    *   **Conclusion:** While *Bustamante-Leiva* doesn't guarantee a grant of asylum on religious grounds, it indicates that the BIA must properly consider such claims. If the BIA in this hypothetical case made similar errors in evaluating the religious claim, there would be a **potential for a remand** for proper consideration, but not an automatic grant. The ultimate success would depend on the specific facts presented and whether they meet the legal standard for religious persecution.

3.  **Due Process Claim - Single BIA Member:**
    *   *Bustamante-Leiva* explicitly **rejected** the argument that a single BIA member decision violates due process. The court affirmed that 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5) allows for single-member review in certain circumstances (e.g., affirmance without opinion, or where the result is clear).
    *   **Conclusion:** This due process claim would likely be **rejected**.

4.  **Due Process Claim - Not Requiring Government Brief:**
    *   *Bustamante-Leiva* also explicitly **rejected** the argument that not requiring the government to file a brief violates due process. The court noted that the BIA has discretion in this matter and due process does not mandate a government brief in every case.
    *   **Conclusion:** This due process claim would likely be **rejected**.

**Overall Likelihood:**

Given that the primary PSG claim would be rejected based on direct precedent, and the due process claims would also fail, the overall likelihood of the petitions being granted is low. While the religious persecution claim could potentially lead to a remand for further consideration, it does not guarantee a grant of asylum. Therefore, based on *Bustamante-Leiva v. Garland*, the petitions for asylum and related relief would **not likely be granted.**",[],,0.8096743822097778,12.901488646777313,35.632053762346004

### Circumstances for a Coalition to Successfully Challenge Immigration Policy Changes for Lack of NEPA Review:

A coalition can successfully challenge specific immigration policy changes when they can demonstrate:

1.  **""Major Federal Action Significantly Affecting the Quality of the Human Environment"":**
    *   **Direct Physical Impacts:** The policy change must constitute a ""major federal action"" that has a direct, foreseeable, and significant *physical* impact on the environment. This is the most crucial element. Examples include:
        *   **Construction or Expansion of Infrastructure:** Building new detention centers, processing facilities, border walls, roads, or other physical structures.
        *   **Significant Operational Changes with Physical Consequences:** Policy changes that lead to a substantial increase in human activity, waste generation, traffic, resource consumption (water, energy), or land disturbance in a specific geographic area (e.g., mass processing of migrants at a particular border crossing leading to increased waste, strain on local infrastructure, or habitat disruption).
        *   **Direct Environmental Release/Impact:** Policies that directly lead to the release of pollutants or the alteration of natural habitats.
    *   **Foreseeable and Concrete Impacts:** The environmental impacts must be reasonably foreseeable and concrete, not merely speculative or remote.

2.  **Lack of NEPA Compliance:**
    *   The agency (e.g., DHS, CBP, ICE) failed to conduct the required NEPA review (e.g., an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)) or improperly determined that the action was covered by a Categorical Exclusion (CE) without adequate justification.

3.  **Standing Under APA:**
    *   **Injury-in-Fact:** Coalition members must demonstrate a concrete and particularized injury that is actual or imminent. For NEPA challenges, this typically involves an *environmental injury* (e.g., living near the affected area, using the area for recreation, aesthetic enjoyment, or having a direct interest in the natural resources impacted).
    *   **Causation:** The injury must be fairly traceable to the agency's failure to conduct NEPA review.
    *   **Redressability:** A favorable court decision (e.g., requiring NEPA review) must be likely to redress the injury.

4.  **Final Agency Action:**
    *   The challenged policy change must constitute a ""final agency action"" ripe for judicial review under the APA. Preliminary decisions or internal guidance generally cannot be challenged.

### Types of Challenges Generally Dismissed:

District Courts generally dismiss challenges when:

1.  **No Direct Physical Environmental Nexus:**
    *   **Purely Programmatic or Policy-Level Changes:** Challenges to high-level policy shifts, internal guidance, or changes in enforcement priorities that do not directly mandate or cause specific, foreseeable physical alterations to the environment. Courts often find these lack the ""major federal action significantly affecting the human environment"" trigger.
    *   **Solely Socio-Economic Impacts:** Challenges based *only* on socio-economic impacts (e.g., strain on social services, economic burden on communities, changes in population demographics) without a clear, direct, and significant link to physical environmental impacts. NEPA primarily focuses on the physical environment, and socio-economic impacts are typically considered only if they are secondary effects of physical environmental changes.
    *   **Diffuse or Speculative Impacts:** The alleged environmental impacts are too diffuse, speculative, or geographically widespread to be considered ""significant"" under NEPA, or they are not directly caused by the specific policy change being challenged.

2.  **Lack of Standing:**
    *   **Generalized Grievances:** The coalition's members assert only a generalized grievance shared by the public at large, rather than a concrete and particularized environmental injury.
    *   **Injury Not Traceable to NEPA Failure:** The alleged injury is caused by the policy itself, rather than by the agency's failure to conduct an environmental review. For example, if the harm would occur regardless of whether an EA/EIS was prepared.

3.  **Lack of Final Agency Action/Ripeness:**
    *   The challenge is brought against a preliminary decision, a proposed rule, or an ongoing process that has not yet resulted in a final, reviewable agency action.

4.  **Proper Application of Categorical Exclusions:**
    *   The agency properly determined that the action falls under an established Categorical Exclusion (CE) and there are no extraordinary circumstances that would warrant further NEPA review. Challenges to the *application* of a CE are often dismissed if the agency's reasoning was not arbitrary and capricious.

In essence, successful NEPA challenges to immigration policy changes hinge on demonstrating a concrete, direct, and significant *physical* environmental impact caused by a specific, final agency action, coupled with the coalition's members having proper standing due to that environmental harm. Challenges lacking this direct physical nexus or proper standing are routinely dismissed.",[],,0.8320547342300415,17.465212418300656,7.563382352941204

Therefore, prejudice is not demonstrated.","Yes, it is **highly likely** that the defendant's motion to withdraw the guilty plea due to ineffective assistance of counsel would be granted based on a strong showing of prejudice under these circumstances.

Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

1.  **The Legal Standard (Strickland v. Washington / Hill v. Lockhart / Lee v. United States):**
    To succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a defendant must show two things:
    *   **Deficient Performance:** Counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.
    *   **Prejudice:** There is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. In the context of a guilty plea, this means showing a reasonable probability that the defendant would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.

2.  **Deficient Performance:**
    *   Under *Padilla v. Kentucky*, counsel has an affirmative duty to advise noncitizen clients about the immigration consequences of a plea, especially when those consequences are ""truly clear."" This duty extends beyond merely stating that deportation *might* occur to advising on the specific, clear consequences, including the unavailability of relief.
    *   Here, the attorney failed to advise the defendant that relief under INA Section 212(c) was unavailable. This is a specific, critical piece of information regarding the *certainty* and *severity* of the immigration consequences. Such a failure almost certainly constitutes deficient performance.
    *   The trial court's general advisement under R.C. 2943.031 is typically insufficient to cure a *Padilla* error, as it's a generic warning and does not provide the specific, accurate legal advice that counsel is obligated to give.

3.  **Prejudice (The Core of the Question):**
    This is where the defendant's claim is particularly strong, especially in light of *Lee v. United States*. To show prejudice in the plea context, the defendant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's error, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. This is not a purely subjective test; the court considers objective factors.

    The facts provided strongly support a finding of prejudice:

    *   **Defendant's Affidavit:** The defendant's sworn statement that he would not have pleaded guilty if he had known about the unavailability of 212(c) relief is a necessary starting point.
    *   **Strong Ties to the U.S.:** This is a critical factor. For a defendant with strong ties to the U.S., avoiding deportation is often a paramount concern, potentially outweighing even a longer prison sentence. The prospect of being permanently separated from family and a life built in the U.S. makes the immigration consequences extremely severe.
    *   **Unavailability of 212(c) Relief:** This is key. It means deportation was likely a *certain* and *unavoidable* consequence of the plea, with no potential avenue for relief that the defendant might have reasonably hoped for. This makes the consequence far more dire than if some form of relief were still possible.
    *   **Potential Grounds for Dismissal or Acquittal:** This is perhaps the *most crucial* factor for establishing prejudice. In *Lee v. United States*, the Supreme Court emphasized that a defendant can show prejudice even if the chances of acquittal were low, as long as there was a *rational reason* to go to trial. The existence of ""potential grounds for dismissal or acquittal"" provides a clear rational reason for the defendant to have rejected the plea and risked trial, even for severe charges. If there were no viable defenses, it would be much harder to argue that a rational defendant would have gone to trial solely to fight deportation.
    *   **Severe Charges:** While the charges were severe, the combination of strong ties to the U.S. and potential defenses makes it rational for the defendant to prioritize avoiding certain deportation by taking a chance at trial.

**Conclusion:**

Given that the defendant had strong ties to the U.S., faced certain deportation due to the unavailability of 212(c) relief (a fact his counsel failed to advise him of), and had potential grounds for dismissal or acquittal, it is highly probable that a court would find a ""reasonable probability"" that he would have insisted on going to trial rather than pleading guilty. The combination of these factors provides a strong, objective basis to credit the defendant's assertion that he would not have pleaded guilty. Therefore, the motion to withdraw the guilty plea due to ineffective assistance of counsel would likely be granted based on a showing of prejudice.",[],,0.83840411901474,11.970110027855153,41.213800139275804

The agency is **obligated to search for and disclose preexisting internal documents** that contain or reflect such statistics.

It is **not obligated to fulfill the request by creating and providing a new statistical table.**

Here's why:

1.  **FOIA Requires Disclosure of Existing Records:** The fundamental principle of the Freedom of Information Act is to provide access to *existing* government records. It does not obligate agencies to create new documents, compile new information, conduct new research, or generate new analyses to fulfill a request.
2.  **""Documents Reflecting Statistics"":** When a requester asks for ""all documents reflecting statistics,"" they are asking for records that already exist within the agency's possession that contain or present those statistics. This could include reports, memos, spreadsheets, database printouts, emails, or any other format where the statistics are recorded.
3.  **Creating a New Table is Not a FOIA Obligation:** If an agency were to create a new statistical table, it would be generating a new document, potentially involving new compilation, analysis, or presentation of data. While an agency *could* choose to do this as a courtesy or if it's the most efficient way to provide the requested information (and the information is readily extractable from existing systems), it is not legally required to do so under FOIA. Its primary duty is to locate and release the existing records.
4.  **Database Nuance:** If the statistics reside in an agency database, and the agency can extract that data using existing programming or query tools with reasonable effort, then the extracted data (even if presented in a new spreadsheet or report format) is generally considered responsive to a FOIA request because it's derived directly from existing, retrievable information. This is different from creating new statistics or performing new analysis.

In summary, the agency must conduct a reasonable search for any existing records that contain the requested statistics and release those records (subject to any applicable exemptions). It cannot simply create a new summary table and claim that fulfills the request if existing, more detailed, or different source documents exist.",[],,0.8450648784637451,15.942134623301772,24.91150576368878

The general grant of federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 is superseded by the specific statutory withdrawal of jurisdiction over post-1991 naturalization matters from district courts.","No, a U.S. citizen naturalized after October 1, 1991, generally **cannot directly rely on 8 C.F.R. § 334.16(b) or 28 U.S.C. § 1331** to establish federal district court jurisdiction to order USCIS to amend their naturalization certificate in this specific scenario. Here's why:

1.  **Regarding 8 C.F.R. § 334.16(b):**
    *   This regulation states: ""The court shall have jurisdiction to correct, reopen, alter, modify, or vacate its judgment or decree naturalizing a person.""
    *   **Crucial Point:** The Immigration Act of 1990, effective October 1, 1991, shifted the authority to naturalize individuals from the federal courts to the Attorney General (and by delegation, to USCIS).
    *   Therefore, for individuals naturalized *after* October 1, 1991, their naturalization was an **administrative act** by USCIS, not a **judicial act** by a court. There is no ""court's judgment or decree"" for a federal court to amend under this regulation. This regulation applies to individuals who were naturalized by a court *before* October 1, 1991.

2.  **Regarding 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (Federal Question Jurisdiction):**
    *   This statute grants federal district courts jurisdiction over ""all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.""
    *   **Crucial Point:** While § 1331 provides a *basis for jurisdiction*, it does **not create a cause of action** itself. A plaintiff must identify a separate federal law that creates the right or duty being enforced.
    *   In this case, the citizen would need an underlying federal cause of action to compel USCIS to act. Potential avenues for such a cause of action could include:
        *   **The Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq.:** This act allows for judicial review of agency actions (or inactions) that are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. If USCIS refuses to amend the certificate after a proper request, a citizen *might* be able to challenge that refusal under the APA, with § 1331 providing the jurisdictional hook.
        *   **The Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1361:** This allows district courts to compel an officer or employee of the United States to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff. However, mandamus is an extraordinary remedy and typically requires a clear, ministerial duty that the agency has failed to perform, not a discretionary one.

**What the citizen *should* do first:**

The citizen should first exhaust administrative remedies by applying to USCIS for a correction. USCIS has a specific process for correcting errors on naturalization certificates:

1.  **Form N-565, Application for Replacement Naturalization/Citizenship Document:** This form is used to apply for a new certificate to correct an error.
2.  **USCIS Policy:** USCIS generally corrects errors that were made by USCIS itself, or errors based on information that was available at the time of naturalization. The situation described (an error on the *original foreign birth certificate* that has *since been corrected*) can be more complex. If the naturalization certificate accurately reflected the *then-incorrect* foreign birth certificate, USCIS might view this as a change in underlying facts rather than a simple USCIS error. However, if the citizen can demonstrate that the original naturalization certificate contained an error based on the information *available to USCIS at the time*, or that the corrected foreign birth certificate should be recognized, USCIS *may* amend it.

**Conclusion:**

The citizen cannot directly use 8 C.F.R. § 334.16(b) because their naturalization was administrative. While 28 U.S.C. § 1331 could provide jurisdiction, it requires an underlying cause of action, most likely under the APA, to challenge a USCIS denial. The proper first step is to apply to USCIS administratively using Form N-565. If USCIS denies the request, the citizen *might* then be able to seek judicial review of that denial in federal district court under the APA, with § 1331 providing the jurisdictional basis. The court would then review USCIS's decision, not directly amend the certificate itself.",[],,0.8381676077842712,12.622877070619008,34.40850479511772

However, the claim of coercion or duress is a critical factor that needs to be rigorously evaluated against a very high legal standard.

Here's a breakdown:

1.  **The Persecutor Bar:**
    *   The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) contains a mandatory bar to asylum (INA § 208(b)(2)(A)(i)) and withholding of removal (INA § 241(b)(3)(B)(i)) for any alien who ""ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.""
    *   This bar is mandatory, meaning if it applies, the individual *cannot* be granted asylum or withholding, regardless of how compelling their fear of future persecution might be.
    *   The key here is ""assisted."" Courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) have held that ""assistance"" does not require the individual to have acted with persecutory intent. The focus is on the objective act of assistance.

2.  **Coercion or Duress as a Defense:**
    *   While persecutory intent is not required for ""assistance,"" the BIA has recognized that actions taken under *extreme duress* may not constitute ""assistance"" for the purpose of the persecutor bar.
    *   The standard for duress is very high. It generally requires:
        *   An immediate threat of death or serious bodily harm to the applicant or a close family member.
        *   No reasonable alternative course of action to avoid the harm.
        *   The individual had no meaningful choice but to participate.
    *   Mere fear, general difficult circumstances, or a desire to avoid unpleasant consequences are typically not enough to establish duress. The individual must demonstrate that their actions were truly involuntary due to an overwhelming and immediate threat.
    *   The BIA's seminal case on this issue is *Matter of A-H-*, 23 I&N Dec. 774 (BIA 2005), which clarified that while persecutory intent is not required, the actions must still be ""voluntary"" in the sense that the individual had a meaningful choice.

3.  **Burden of Proof:**
    *   **Initial Burden (Eligibility):** The applicant bears the initial burden of proof to establish their eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal (e.g., that they have a well-founded fear of persecution).
    *   **Burden Shift (Persecutor Bar):**
        *   Once the government (Department of Homeland Security, DHS) presents *prima facie* evidence that the applicant ""ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person,"" the burden shifts to the *applicant*.
        *   The applicant then bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the persecutor bar does *not* apply to them. This includes demonstrating that their actions were not ""assistance"" because they were taken under extreme duress that meets the high legal standard.

**In summary:**

The individual is *not automatically barred* if they claim coercion, but they face a significant hurdle. They will need to present compelling evidence to demonstrate that their actions were truly involuntary due to extreme duress, meeting the very high legal standard established in case law. The burden of proof regarding the applicability of the persecutor bar, once raised by the government, falls squarely on the applicant to show that the bar does not apply.",[],,0.8152810335159302,14.21413731343284,31.34131044776123
"An individual, a native of Tanzania, entered the U.S. on a student visa and subsequently married a U.S. citizen. This marriage was later annulled, but before the annulment, the U.S. citizen spouse filed an I-130 petition on the individual's behalf, which was later denied due to the U.S. citizen spouse's fraudulent multiple marriages. The individual then married a second U.S. citizen, claiming battery and extreme cruelty, and filed an I-360 self-petition. The USCIS and AAO denied this I-360 petition, citing the previous marriage as fraudulent under Section 204(c) and also finding a failure to prove good faith in the second marriage. The individual appeals, arguing that the annulment means the first marriage never existed and that the previous I-130 denial should not apply to the current I-360 petition. Is the agency's decision to deny the I-360 petition, based on the prior fraudulent marriage and lack of good faith in the second marriage, arbitrary or capricious?","No, the agency's decision to deny the I-360 petition was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The court found that there was more than enough evidence to support the conclusion that the plaintiff and his first U.S. citizen spouse did not marry in good faith, given the spouse's conviction for marriage fraud involving five marriages. The fact that the plaintiff obtained an annulment did not establish his intent at the time of the marriage. Therefore, the I-360 petition was properly denied because the plaintiff had previously sought immediate relative status based on a marriage determined to be for the purpose of evading immigration laws, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c). Additionally, the court found an independent basis for denial: the plaintiff failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he entered into his second marriage in good faith, as required for the I-360 petition, having provided limited probative details beyond the abuse he sustained.",,,,,,,,"No, the agency's decision to deny the I-360 petition was neither arbitrary nor capricious.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1.  **Standard of Review (Arbitrary or Capricious):**
    An agency decision is considered arbitrary or capricious if the agency ""relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise."" This is a highly deferential standard, meaning courts generally give significant leeway to agency decisions as long as there is a rational basis.

2.  **Application of Section 204(c) Despite Annulment:**
    *   **The Law:** Section 204(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) states that ""no petition shall be approved if the alien has previously sought to be accorded, or has been accorded, an immediate relative or preference status as the spouse of a citizen of the United States or as the spouse of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, by reason of a marriage entered into to evade the immigration laws.""
    *   **Immigration vs. State Law:** While an annulment under state law typically means the marriage was void *ab initio* (never legally existed), immigration law often treats marriages differently for the purpose of determining immigration benefits. USCIS and federal courts have consistently held that Section 204(c) can apply even if a marriage is later annulled or terminated, as long as there was an attempt to gain immigration benefits through a marriage that was found to be fraudulent *for immigration purposes*. The focus of 204(c) is on the *intent* at the time the marriage was entered into or the petition was filed, and the *attempt* to evade immigration laws.
    *   **Facts of the Case:** The crucial fact here is that the *previous I-130 petition was denied due to the U.S. citizen spouse's fraudulent multiple marriages*. This indicates that USCIS already made a finding that the *basis* for that I-130 (the marriage) was fraudulent in the context of immigration benefits. Even if the individual claims to have been an innocent party, the agency's prior finding regarding the fraudulent nature of the marriage for immigration purposes provides a rational basis for applying 204(c) to bar future petitions. The annulment, while legally dissolving the marriage, does not erase the fact that an I-130 was filed based on it, and that I-130 was denied due to fraud.

3.  **Failure to Prove Good Faith in the Second Marriage:**
    *   **I-360 VAWA Requirement:** For an I-360 self-petition based on battery or extreme cruelty, the petitioner must demonstrate that they entered into the marriage with the U.S. citizen spouse in good faith, not solely to obtain immigration benefits.
    *   **Agency's Discretion:** USCIS and the AAO have the authority to weigh the evidence presented by the petitioner to determine if the good faith requirement has been met. While the individual claimed battery and extreme cruelty (a necessary component of a VAWA petition), this does not automatically prove good faith in entering the marriage. The agency would look at all surrounding circumstances, including shared life, commingled finances, joint assets, and the overall credibility of the petitioner.
    *   **Rational Basis:** If the agency found that the evidence presented by the individual was insufficient, contradictory, or otherwise failed to establish good faith in the second marriage, that finding would likely be upheld as long as it was based on a review of the evidence and not arbitrary. The prior history of involvement with a marriage deemed fraudulent for immigration purposes (even if the individual claims innocence) could also lead to heightened scrutiny of the good faith claim in the subsequent marriage.

**Conclusion:**

Given the agency's prior finding of fraud related to the first marriage (which triggered 204(c)) and its independent finding of a failure to prove good faith in the second marriage, the agency's decision is **not likely to be found arbitrary or capricious**.

*   The application of Section 204(c) despite an annulment is consistent with established immigration law principles that prioritize the intent to evade immigration laws over state-law marital validity.
*   The finding of a lack of good faith in the second marriage is a factual determination within the agency's purview, and without specific evidence showing the agency ignored relevant facts or made an irrational conclusion, it would likely be upheld.

The individual's argument that the annulment means the first marriage ""never existed"" is a valid point under state law, but it often does not carry the same weight in the context of federal immigration law, particularly when a prior immigration petition based on that marriage was already denied due to fraud.",[],,0.8334757685661316,17.810210709759193,25.926190589353638
"In an Administrative Procedure Act (APA) challenge to the denial of an I-129 immigration petition by USCIS, where the plaintiffs reside in Washington and the petition was adjudicated by a USCIS service center in California, can the case initially filed in the District of Columbia be transferred to another district, and what factors guide such a transfer decision?","Yes, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia can transfer such a case to another district, specifically to the Central District of California, based on the court's authority under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) for the ""convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice.""

1.  **Could the case have been brought in the transferee district?** Yes, both the Central District of California (where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred, as the USCIS California Service Center adjudicated the petition) and the Western District of Washington (where the plaintiffs reside) are proper venues under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).
2.  **Do private and public interests favor transfer?** The court found that these interests largely weigh in favor of transfer to the Central District of California.

Consequently, the court granted the motion to transfer the case to the Central District of California and did not address the defendant's motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction or improper venue.","Yes, the case initially filed in the District of Columbia can be transferred to another district. The primary statute governing such transfers in federal court is **28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)**, which states:

""For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.""

Here's a breakdown of why it can be transferred and the factors guiding the decision:

### I. Can it be Transferred?

Yes.
1.  **Initial Venue in D.C.:** D.C. is often a proper venue for APA challenges against federal agencies because the agency's headquarters (USCIS is part of DHS, headquartered in D.C.) is located there, and the final agency action (the denial) can be considered to have occurred there.
2.  **""Where it Might Have Been Brought"":** For a transfer under § 1404(a), the transferee district must be one where the action could have originally been filed. In this scenario:
    *   **California:** This is where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred (the adjudication by the USCIS service center, compilation of the administrative record). Therefore, California would likely be a proper venue.
    *   **Washington:** This is where the plaintiffs reside. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1), venue is proper in a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located. While USCIS is a federal agency, the ""residence"" of a federal agency for venue purposes can be complex, but often includes the district where the plaintiff resides if the agency has a presence there or the impact is felt there. More directly, § 1391(b)(2) allows venue where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated. The impact on the plaintiffs in Washington could be argued as a ""substantial part of the events.""

Since both California and potentially Washington could have been proper venues initially, the case *can* be transferred to either of those districts from D.C.

### II. Factors Guiding the Transfer Decision

When deciding whether to transfer a case under § 1404(a), courts consider a variety of public and private interest factors, balancing the convenience of the parties and witnesses with the interest of justice.

**A. Private Interest Factors (Convenience of Parties and Witnesses):**

1.  **Plaintiff's Choice of Forum:** The plaintiff's choice of forum is generally given significant deference, especially if it is the plaintiff's home forum. However, this deference is lessened when the chosen forum has little connection to the operative facts of the lawsuit (e.g., D.C. in this case, where the plaintiffs are not from D.C. and the adjudication wasn't physically in D.C.).
2.  **Convenience of Parties:**
    *   **Plaintiffs:** Reside in Washington. A transfer to Washington would be most convenient for them. A transfer to California might be less convenient than D.C. depending on travel logistics, but still potentially closer to the ""events"" than D.C.
    *   **Defendant (USCIS/Government):** While the Department of Justice attorneys handling the case might be in D.C., the relevant USCIS personnel who adjudicated the petition and compiled the administrative record are in California. A transfer to California might be more convenient for the agency's internal consultation and record access.
3.  **Convenience of Witnesses:** In APA challenges, live witnesses are rare, as the court's review is typically limited to the administrative record. However, if there were any procedural due process claims or other issues requiring testimony from USCIS personnel, those witnesses would likely be in California. Similarly, if the plaintiffs needed to present any testimony, they would be in Washington.
4.  **Location of Relevant Evidence/Administrative Record:** The administrative record, which is central to an APA review, was compiled by the USCIS service center in California. While records are often electronic and accessible anywhere, the physical location of the original record and the personnel who created it is a factor.

**B. Public Interest Factors (Interest of Justice):**

1.  **Local Interest in the Controversy:**
    *   **California:** Has a strong local interest in the operations of a major federal service center within its borders and the decisions it makes.
    *   **Washington:** Has a strong local interest in the legal challenges brought by its residents against federal agencies.
    *   **D.C.:** Has a general interest in overseeing federal agencies, but perhaps less specific local interest in this particular I-129 denial than California or Washington.
2.  **Court Congestion and Docket Efficiency:** Courts may consider the relative congestion of the dockets in the potential transferor and transferee districts to ensure the case can be resolved expeditiously.
3.  **Familiarity with Applicable Law:** This factor is less relevant here, as the case involves federal APA and immigration law, which federal courts nationwide are equally competent to apply.
4.  **Avoidance of Unnecessary Conflicts of Law:** Not applicable here, as it's a federal question case.
5.  **Fairness and Equity:** The overall fairness of requiring the parties to litigate in a particular forum.

**Conclusion on Transfer:**

Given these factors, a court in D.C. might consider transferring the case to:

*   **The Central District of California (or the appropriate district in California):** This would likely be the strongest candidate, as it's where the agency action occurred, the record was compiled, and the relevant agency personnel are located. It also balances the convenience for the defendant with the ""events"" of the case.
*   **The Western District of Washington (or the appropriate district in Washington):** This would be most convenient for the plaintiffs and where the impact of the denial is felt.

The court would weigh all these factors, giving some deference to the plaintiff's initial choice of D.C., but ultimately deciding which forum best serves the convenience of parties and witnesses and the interest of justice.",[],,0.8692503571510315,12.227340062434962,41.63159073881377
"If an individual receives a Notice to Appear (NTA) for removal proceedings that does not initially specify the time and place of the hearing, and they subsequently apply for cancellation of removal based on hardship to their children, can they challenge the validity of the NTA in federal court and appeal the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) finding that their children would not face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship?","No, an individual in this situation would likely not succeed in challenging the NTA's validity or appealing the hardship determination.
Regarding the NTA, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that an NTA which does not list the time and place of the initial hearing is not defective as a valid charging document, because regulations (8 C.F.R. § 1003.18(b)), not the statute (8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)), govern what an NTA must contain, and subsequent notices can cure any deficiency by providing the required information.

Garland*, which held that such hardship determinations are discretionary and authoritative decisions beyond federal court review.","Yes, an individual in this situation can potentially challenge both aspects, but with significant differences in the likelihood of success and the scope of federal court review.

Here's a breakdown:

### 1. Challenging the Validity of the NTA (Lack of Time and Place)

**Yes, this can be challenged in federal court as a question of law.**

*   **Legal Basis:** The Supreme Court cases *Pereira v. Sessions* (2018) and *Niz-Chavez v. Garland* (2021) established that a Notice to Appear (NTA) must specify the time and place of the initial hearing to be considered a ""notice to appear"" for purposes of the ""stop-time rule"" for cancellation of removal. While these cases primarily addressed the stop-time rule, they highlighted the statutory requirement for a complete NTA under INA § 239(a).
*   **Jurisdictional vs. Statutory Defect:** While the Supreme Court later clarified in *Garland v. Alcaraz-Lopez* (2023) that an NTA lacking time and place does *not* deprive the immigration court of subject-matter jurisdiction, it remains a statutory defect.
*   **Federal Court Review:**
    *   **Question of Law:** Whether an NTA that initially lacks time and place satisfies the statutory requirements of INA § 239(a) is a pure question of law. Federal courts generally have jurisdiction to review questions of law under INA § 242(a)(2)(D).
    *   **Due Process:** The individual could also argue that the lack of initial notice violated their due process rights, especially if it prejudiced their ability to prepare their case or understand the proceedings.
    *   **Exhaustion:** Crucially, the individual *must* have raised this argument before the Immigration Judge (IJ) and then appealed it to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) to ""exhaust"" their administrative remedies. If they failed to do so, a federal court would likely decline to hear the challenge.
*   **Potential Outcome:** If successful, the challenge might lead to a finding that the NTA was not properly issued for certain purposes (e.g., stopping the clock for continuous physical presence), which could make the individual eligible for cancellation of removal if they otherwise meet the continuous physical presence requirement. It could also lead to termination of proceedings if the government cannot cure the defect or if the defect was so severe as to violate due process.

### 2. Appealing the BIA's Finding on Hardship for Cancellation of Removal

**No, this is generally *not* reviewable by federal courts, with very narrow exceptions.**

*   **Nature of the Finding:** The determination of whether a child would face ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" is a discretionary decision and a finding of fact. It involves weighing evidence and applying a subjective standard.
*   **Statutory Bar to Review:**
    *   **INA § 242(a)(2)(B)(i):** This section explicitly states that ""no court shall have jurisdiction to review... any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section... 240A(b)(1) [cancellation of removal for non-LPRs]."" This is a broad jurisdictional bar.
    *   **INA § 242(a)(2)(D):** While this section allows for review of ""constitutional claims or questions of law,"" the *substantive finding* that hardship is not ""exceptional and extremely unusual"" is typically not considered a pure question of law or a constitutional claim.
*   **Limited Exceptions (Very Narrow):**
    *   **Pure Questions of Law:** A federal court *could* review a pure question of law related to the hardship determination. For example, if the BIA applied the *wrong legal standard* for ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship,"" or if it failed to consider a legally relevant factor. However, simply disagreeing with the BIA's application of the correct standard to the facts is not a question of law.
    *   **Constitutional Claims:** A federal court *could* review a constitutional claim, such as a severe due process violation in the *process* of making the hardship determination (e.g., if the BIA refused to consider relevant evidence, or if the individual was denied a fair opportunity to present their case). However, arguing that the BIA's *conclusion* on hardship was wrong is not typically a due process claim.
    *   **Abuse of Discretion (Extremely Rare):** While the statute generally bars review of discretionary decisions, some courts have held that review might be possible in cases of ""egregious"" or ""arbitrary and capricious"" abuse of discretion that rises to the level of a constitutional violation, but this is an exceptionally high bar and rarely met.

**In summary:**

*   **NTA Validity:** The individual has a strong basis to challenge the NTA's validity in federal court as a question of law, provided they properly exhausted administrative remedies.
*   **Hardship Finding:** The individual faces a significant statutory bar to federal court review of the BIA's substantive finding that their children would not face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. Review would only be possible under very narrow circumstances involving a pure question of law or a severe constitutional due process violation in the process of making that finding.",[],,0.8322100639343262,13.974713537771134,33.74994240837697
"Does a plaintiff's complaint alleging an unreasonable delay by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in adjudicating an EB-5 immigrant investor visa petition, and by the FBI in completing associated background checks, state a plausible claim for relief under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) or the Mandamus Act, particularly when the government asserts a ""visa availability approach"" as its processing rationale?","No, the plaintiff's Amended Complaint fails to state a plausible claim of unreasonable delay under the APA or the Mandamus Act.

Therefore, the complaint does not state a claim for unreasonable delay.","Yes, a plaintiff's complaint alleging an unreasonable delay by USCIS in adjudicating an EB-5 petition and by the FBI in completing associated background checks *can* state a plausible claim for relief under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) or the Mandamus Act, even when the government asserts a ""visa availability approach"" as its processing rationale. However, success is highly fact-dependent and challenging.

Here's a breakdown:

### I. Administrative Procedure Act (APA) - 5 U.S.C. § 706(1)

The APA allows courts to ""compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed."" This is the primary vehicle for challenging agency delays.

**Elements for an APA Unreasonable Delay Claim:**

1.  **Agency Action:** The adjudication of an EB-5 petition and the underlying background checks are agency actions.
2.  **Unreasonable Delay:** This is the core of the claim. Courts typically apply the six-factor test from *Telecommunications Research & Action Center v. FCC (TRAC v. FCC)*:
    *   **Time Agency Has Taken:** How long has the petition been pending?
    *   **Prejudice Suffered by Plaintiff:** What harm has the delay caused (e.g., business disruption, loss of investment opportunity, aging out of dependents)?
    *   **Effect of Expedited Action on Other Cases:** Would prioritizing this case unduly disrupt the agency's processing of other cases?
    *   **Agency's Resources:** Does the agency have limited resources?
    *   **Nature and Complexity of the Task:** EB-5 petitions are complex, involving significant financial and national security vetting.
    *   **Extent to Which Agency Action Is Within Its Discretion:** While the *outcome* of an adjudication is discretionary, the *duty to adjudicate* is not.

**Impact of the ""Visa Availability Approach"":**

The government's ""visa availability approach"" is a significant factor but not necessarily a complete defense.

*   **Government's Argument:** USCIS often argues that it prioritizes petitions for countries where visas are immediately available (i.e., no visa bulletin backlog) to maximize visa utilization. For countries with backlogs (like China or India for EB-5), they may argue that adjudicating petitions faster wouldn't result in a green card any sooner, as the visa number itself isn't available.
*   **Plaintiff's Counter-Argument:**
    *   **Duty to Adjudicate:** Regardless of visa availability, USCIS still has a statutory duty to adjudicate petitions in a ""reasonable time."" The ""visa availability approach"" might explain *some* delay, but it doesn't excuse *indefinite* delay.
    *   **Prejudice:** Even if a visa number isn't immediately available, a pending I-526 approval is crucial for many reasons (e.g., maintaining legal status, planning, demonstrating progress to investors, preventing dependents from aging out).
    *   **Challenging the Policy:** A plaintiff might argue that while the approach is a valid policy consideration, its *application* in their specific case, or the policy itself, leads to an unreasonable delay that violates the APA.
    *   **FBI Checks:** The ""visa availability approach"" doesn't directly explain delays in FBI background checks, which are a prerequisite for *any* adjudication. If the FBI checks are the bottleneck, the government's rationale for USCIS processing order is less relevant to that specific delay.

### II. Mandamus Act - 28 U.S.C. § 1361

The Mandamus Act grants district courts original jurisdiction to compel an officer or employee of the United States to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.

**Elements for a Mandamus Claim:**

1.  **Clear, Nondiscretionary Duty:** The government official must have a clear, ministerial, and nondiscretionary duty to perform the action.
2.  **Plaintiff's Clear Right:** The plaintiff must have a clear right to the performance of that duty.
3.  **No Other Adequate Remedy:** The plaintiff must have no other adequate remedy available.

**Application to EB-5 Delays:**

*   **Duty to Adjudicate:** While the *outcome* of an EB-5 petition is discretionary, the *duty to adjudicate* it within a reasonable time is often considered nondiscretionary. Courts have generally held that agencies have a duty to process applications.
*   **""Clear"" Duty Challenge:** The ""clear"" aspect can be tricky. The government will argue that *when* to adjudicate is discretionary, especially given the ""visa availability approach"" and resource constraints. However, an *indefinite* delay can transform a discretionary timing into a failure to perform a clear duty.
*   **Overlap with APA:** In practice, Mandamus claims for unreasonable delay often overlap significantly with APA claims under § 706(1). Many courts treat them similarly in this context.

### III. Challenges and Nuances

*   **Judicial Deference:** Courts generally grant significant deference to agency expertise in managing their dockets and allocating resources.
*   **FBI Background Checks:** Courts are extremely reluctant to interfere with national security background checks. These are often considered highly discretionary and sensitive. Plaintiffs typically have less success compelling the FBI directly. The best a court might do is order USCIS to follow up with the FBI or adjudicate if the FBI checks are the *only* remaining hurdle and have been pending for an exceptionally long time.
*   **Remedy:** Even if a court finds an unreasonable delay, it typically won't order USCIS to *approve* the petition. Instead, it will usually order USCIS to adjudicate the petition within a specified timeframe (e.g., 60-90 days) or to provide a status update and a timeline for adjudication.
*   **Fact-Intensive:** The success of such a claim hinges on the specific facts: the exact length of the delay, the reasons provided (or not provided) by the agency, the specific prejudice to the plaintiff, and the agency's overall processing times for similar petitions.

### Conclusion

A plaintiff's complaint alleging unreasonable delay in EB-5 adjudication and FBI background checks *can* state a plausible claim under the APA or Mandamus Act. The ""visa availability approach"" is a significant defense for the government, but it does not automatically defeat the claim. Plaintiffs must demonstrate that, even considering this approach, the delay in their specific case is unreasonable, that they have suffered prejudice, and that the agency has failed in its fundamental duty to adjudicate petitions within a reasonable timeframe. The hurdle is particularly high for compelling the FBI directly.",[],,0.8085870742797852,13.365293796332423,29.421844323058934
"In a child custody dispute where one parent has been deported due to alleged domestic violence, can a U.S. federal court order the children to travel abroad to visit the deported parent, even if the other parent fears for her safety and that of the children if they were to leave the U.S.?","Yes, a U.S. federal court can order children to travel abroad for visitation with a deported parent if the trial court finds that the deported parent is not an unfit caregiver and that in-person contact is in the children's best interest. Such an order is permissible, particularly when the deported parent's inability to enter the United States makes international travel the only reasonable option for visitation. The court must consider all relevant factors, including acts of domestic violence between the parties, the safety of the child, and the safety of either party. However, specific statutory language regarding a party's absence or relocation due to domestic violence will not be applied if that party has not, in fact, relocated or been absent for that reason. Electronic communication may supplement but not replace in-person visitation.",,,,,,,,"Yes, a U.S. federal court can order children to travel abroad for visitation with a deported parent if the trial court finds that the deported parent is not an unfit caregiver and that in-person contact is in the children's best interest.

However, specific statutory language regarding a party's absence or relocation due to domestic violence will not be applied if that party has not, in fact, relocated or been absent for that reason. Electronic communication may supplement but not replace in-person visitation.","Based on U.S. law and practice:

1.  **Federal Court Jurisdiction:**
    Generally, U.S. federal courts **do not have jurisdiction over domestic relations matters**, which include child custody, visitation, and child support. These issues are almost exclusively handled by **state courts**. While there are very narrow exceptions (e.g., diversity jurisdiction if parties are from different states and meet a high monetary threshold, or specific federal statutes like the International Child Abduction Remedies Act, which deals with the *return* of abducted children, not ordering initial travel), a federal court would almost certainly decline to hear a case solely focused on ordering international visitation in a custody dispute.

    Therefore, the premise of a U.S. federal court making such an order is highly unlikely. It would be a **state court** that would consider such a request.

2.  **State Court Considerations (Assuming it were a state court):**
    If this question were posed to a state court, the court's paramount concern would be the **""best interest of the child.""** Given the circumstances described, it would be **highly unlikely** for a U.S. state court to order children to travel abroad to visit a parent deported for alleged domestic violence, especially if the other parent fears for their safety.

    Here's why a state court would be extremely hesitant:

    *   **Safety Concerns (Domestic Violence Allegations):** Allegations of domestic violence are taken very seriously. If the deportation was due to *alleged* domestic violence, the court would scrutinize the findings and any evidence related to those allegations. Ordering children into a situation where there's a credible fear of harm or abuse would be contrary to their best interest.
    *   **Risk of International Abduction:** Courts are extremely cautious about ordering children to travel to foreign countries, particularly if there's any risk that the deported parent might not return the children to the U.S. This risk is heightened when there's a history of conflict or allegations of violence. The U.S. is a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, which provides a mechanism for the return of children wrongfully removed or retained, but prevention is always preferred over post-abduction remedies.
    *   **Enforceability of U.S. Orders Abroad:** A U.S. court order for visitation or return might not be easily enforceable in a foreign country, especially if that country is not a signatory to relevant international treaties or does not have a reciprocal agreement with the U.S.
    *   **Safety of the Destination Country:** The court would consider the political stability, legal system, and general safety of the country where the deported parent resides.
    *   **Logistical Challenges:** Issues like passport requirements, travel costs, and the practicalities of ensuring safe travel and return would also be considered.
    *   **Parental Rights vs. Child Safety:** While a deported parent still retains parental rights (unless those rights have been terminated), the court must balance those rights against the child's right to safety and well-being. In cases of alleged domestic violence and fear for safety, the latter almost always takes precedence.

**Conclusion:**

No, a U.S. federal court would almost certainly **not** order children to travel abroad for visitation in such a scenario due to lack of jurisdiction.

If the matter were before a **state court** (which is the correct forum), it would be **highly improbable** for such an order to be issued. Given the allegations of domestic violence and the other parent's credible fears for the safety of herself and the children, a state court would prioritize the children's safety and well-being above all else. The court would likely explore alternative forms of contact, such as virtual visitation (video calls), rather than ordering international travel that poses significant safety risks.",[],,0.832828938961029,12.496118311036792,38.75615071070234
"An individual, who is a lawful permanent resident (LPR), applies for naturalization. During the review, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) discovers that the individual's original application for LPR status contained a material misrepresentation, specifically omitting a prior marriage. The individual contends that this omission was an attorney's inadvertent error, not fraudulent or willful, and that they were not otherwise inadmissible on the true facts. Based on this discovery, USCIS denies the naturalization application, concluding the individual was not ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence."" Is the individual eligible for naturalization?","No, the individual is not eligible for naturalization. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirms that an individual is not ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence"" if their application for adjustment to LPR status contained a material misrepresentation, even if the misrepresentation was not fraudulent or willful, and even if the individual believes they would not have been inadmissible on the true facts. This is because the application, containing a material misrepresentation, did not comply with 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(a)(2), which requires all information to be ""true and correct."" Failure to be lawfully admitted for permanent residence is a statutory bar to naturalization.",,,,,,,,"No, the individual is not eligible for naturalization.

Failure to be lawfully admitted for permanent residence is a statutory bar to naturalization.","No, the individual is likely **not eligible for naturalization**.

Here's why:

1.  **""Lawfully Admitted for Permanent Residence"" Requirement:** A fundamental requirement for naturalization is that the applicant must have been ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence"" (INA § 318). This means that the LPR status must have been obtained in compliance with all substantive and procedural requirements of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) at the time it was granted.

2.  **Material Misrepresentation Vitiates Lawful Admission:** Even if the misrepresentation was not deemed ""fraudulent"" (i.e., lacking willful intent to deceive), a *material* misrepresentation in the original LPR application means the individual was not ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence."" A misrepresentation is material if it has a natural tendency to influence, or was capable of influencing, the decision of the immigration official. Omitting a prior marriage is generally considered material because it prevents USCIS from fully assessing eligibility, especially regarding grounds of inadmissibility related to marriage (e.g., bigamy, prior sham marriages, or even just the accuracy of marital history for background checks).

3.  **Intent vs. Lawfulness of Admission:** While the individual's argument about ""attorney's inadvertent error, not fraudulent or willful"" might be relevant to specific grounds of inadmissibility (like INA 212(a)(6)(C)(i) which requires *willful* misrepresentation), it does not necessarily cure the defect in the *lawfulness* of the original admission for naturalization purposes. The fact remains that the LPR status was granted based on incomplete or incorrect information, which deprived the government of the opportunity to make a fully informed decision.

4.  **""Not Otherwise Inadmissible on the True Facts"":** This argument, while important, also doesn't automatically make the original admission ""lawful."" Even if the prior marriage itself would not have made the individual inadmissible, the *act of misrepresenting or omitting* that fact during the application process means the LPR status was not properly obtained. The government was prevented from inquiring into the true facts.

**Conclusion:**

USCIS's denial is consistent with established legal precedent. Courts have consistently held that an individual who obtained LPR status through a material misrepresentation, even if not fraudulent, was not ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence"" and is therefore ineligible for naturalization. The LPR status, in such cases, is considered void *ab initio* (void from the beginning) for naturalization purposes, regardless of how long the individual has held the physical green card.

The individual's LPR status itself could potentially be subject to rescission proceedings if USCIS determines the misrepresentation was material.",[],,0.8508995771408081,17.473166666666668,9.36894444444448
"If the Secretary of Homeland Security revokes an approved visa petition under 8 U.S.C. § 1155 for what they deem to be good and sufficient cause, can the affected individual seek judicial review of that revocation decision in a U.S. federal court?","No, a U.S. federal court lacks jurisdiction to review such a decision. The Secretary of Homeland Security's decision to revoke a visa petition authorized by 8 U.S.C. § 1155 is discretionary, and pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), Congress has removed federal courts' jurisdiction to review such discretionary actions.",,,,,,,,"No, a U.S. federal court lacks jurisdiction to review such a decision. The Secretary of Homeland Security's decision to revoke a visa petition authorized by 8 U.S.C. § 1155 is discretionary, and pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), Congress has removed federal courts' jurisdiction to review such discretionary actions.","Generally, the ability of an affected individual to seek judicial review of a Secretary of Homeland Security's decision to revoke an approved visa petition under 8 U.S.C. § 1155 for ""good and sufficient cause"" is **severely limited**, though not entirely impossible in very narrow circumstances.

Here's a breakdown of why:

1.  **Discretionary Nature of the Decision:**
    *   8 U.S.C. § 1155 states that the Secretary of Homeland Security (or the Attorney General, as the statute originally read) ""may, at any time, for good and sufficient cause, revoke the approval of any petition.""
    *   The phrase ""good and sufficient cause"" grants the Secretary a high degree of discretion.
    *   Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), agency actions ""committed to agency discretion by law"" are generally not subject to judicial review (5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2)). Courts have largely interpreted the revocation authority under § 1155 as falling into this category.

2.  **Immigration-Specific Judicial Review Bars:**
    *   The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) contains specific provisions that limit judicial review of certain immigration decisions.
    *   8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) specifically bars judicial review of ""any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security."" While § 1155 isn't explicitly listed, the discretionary nature of the ""good and sufficient cause"" standard often brings it under the purview of such bars.

3.  **Narrow Exceptions: Constitutional Claims and Questions of Law:**
    *   Despite the broad bars on judicial review, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D) provides a crucial exception: ""Nothing in subparagraph (B) or (C), or in any other provision of this Act (other than this section) which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.""
    *   This means that while a federal court generally cannot review the Secretary's *discretionary judgment* that ""good and sufficient cause"" exists, it *can* review:
        *   **Constitutional claims:** For example, if the individual alleges a violation of due process (e.g., no notice of the intent to revoke, no opportunity to respond, or a decision based on constitutionally impermissible factors).
        *   **Pure questions of law:** For example, if the Secretary misinterpreted the statute itself, acted outside their statutory authority (ultra vires), or applied an incorrect legal standard.

**Conclusion:**

An affected individual **cannot typically seek judicial review of the Secretary's discretionary determination that ""good and sufficient cause"" exists** to revoke an approved visa petition under 8 U.S.C. § 1155. Federal courts will generally decline to second-guess the factual findings or the exercise of discretion in such matters.

However, an individual **may be able to seek judicial review on very narrow grounds** if they can articulate a genuine **constitutional claim** (e.g., a due process violation) or a **pure question of law** (e.g., the Secretary acted beyond their statutory authority or misinterpreted the law) rather than merely challenging the discretionary outcome itself. The bar for successful review in such cases is very high.",[],,0.8479971885681152,15.790671936758894,22.816877470355763
"An individual facing a deportation order, whose claims for U-visa waitlist eligibility and employment authorization adjudication have been dismissed by a federal district court, seeks a preliminary injunction to prevent removal while awaiting a decision on their U-visa application, and also has remaining claims challenging the agency's failure to issue interim work authorization documents. The individual subsequently receives employment authorization through an unrelated process. Does the district court have jurisdiction to grant the preliminary injunction, and are the remaining interim work authorization claims moot?","No, the district court lacks jurisdiction to grant a preliminary injunction staying removal.

1.  **Does the district court have jurisdiction to grant the preliminary injunction to prevent removal?**

    **No, it is highly unlikely the district court has jurisdiction to grant the preliminary injunction in this scenario.**

    *   **Jurisdiction Stripping:** Federal courts face significant jurisdiction stripping in immigration matters, particularly concerning discretionary decisions and orders of removal. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B) generally strips courts of jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions by the Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security. While 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D) restores jurisdiction for ""constitutional claims or questions of law,"" the underlying U-visa application process, including waitlist eligibility and the decision to grant interim benefits, is largely discretionary.
    *   **Prior Dismissal:** The fact that the federal district court *already dismissed* claims for U-visa waitlist eligibility and employment authorization adjudication is a strong indicator that the court has already found a lack of jurisdiction or a lack of reviewable legal error regarding the agency's handling of these discretionary aspects. A preliminary injunction to prevent removal while awaiting a discretionary U-visa decision would likely be seen as an attempt to circumvent these prior dismissals or to compel a discretionary act.
    *   **Enjoining Removal:** Furthermore, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f) severely limits judicial review of removal orders, stating that ""no court shall have jurisdiction to enjoin or restrain the removal of any alien pursuant to a final order of removal unless the alien shows by clear and convincing evidence that the entry of such order is prohibited as a matter of law."" Simply awaiting a discretionary U-visa decision, especially after related claims have been dismissed, typically does not meet this high bar. The individual would need to present a new, reviewable legal or constitutional claim that directly challenges the legality of the removal itself, independent of the discretionary U-visa process.

2.  **Are the remaining interim work authorization claims moot?**

    **Yes, the remaining interim work authorization claims are moot.**

    *   **Mootness Doctrine:** A case becomes moot when the issues presented are no longer ""live"" or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome. A federal court's jurisdiction is limited to ""cases"" and ""controversies"" under Article III of the Constitution.
    *   **Relief Obtained:** The individual's claims challenged the agency's *failure to issue interim work authorization documents*. The subsequent receipt of employment authorization through an unrelated process means the specific relief sought by those claims (the issuance of work authorization) has now been obtained. The court can no longer provide effective relief for the *failure to issue* the document, as the document has now been issued.
    *   **No Live Controversy:** There is no longer a live controversy regarding the *issuance* of interim work authorization. Unless the claims were specifically for damages incurred during the period *before* the work authorization was received, the claims for the *issuance* of the document itself are moot.",[],,0.8260719776153564,15.67727272727273,20.877280431433007

    *   **Exemption 6 (Personnel and Medical Files):** Protects information in personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a ""clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.""

    *   **Balancing Test:** To apply these exemptions, the agency must balance the privacy interest of the individual (the judge) against the public interest in disclosure.
        *   **Privacy Interest:** Judges have a privacy interest in not being subjected to harassment, threats, or unwanted scrutiny based on complaints, especially given the often contentious nature of immigration cases. Releasing names, genders, and specific work locations could facilitate such targeting.
        *   **Public Interest:** There is a public interest in government transparency and accountability, including the conduct of public officials like judges.
    *   **Outcome:** Courts have often sided with agencies in protecting the identities of lower-level government employees or those whose duties expose them to potential harassment, especially when the public interest in their *specific identity* is deemed less significant than the privacy interest. However, the *nature* of the complaint and the *outcome* (e.g., disciplinary action) might still be disclosable, even if the judge's identity is withheld.

2.  **Redacting information about other complaints as ""non-responsive"" from a specific complaint file:**
    *   **Yes, this is standard FOIA practice.**
    *   FOIA requires agencies to provide records that are *responsive* to the request. If a request specifically asks for ""all complaints against Judge X,"" then information pertaining to ""complaints against Judge Y"" would be considered non-responsive to that particular request.
    *   Agencies are not required to provide information that falls outside the scope of the request. If the requester wanted information about other judges, they would need to submit a broader request.

3.  **Declining to proactively publish immigration judge complaint resolutions:**
    *   **Yes, generally, EOIR can decline to proactively publish all complaint resolutions.**
    *   FOIA primarily mandates *reactive* disclosure (responding to specific requests), not *proactive* publication, with some exceptions.
    *   **Proactive Disclosure Requirements (5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2)):** Agencies are required to proactively publish certain types of records in an electronic ""reading room,"" including:
        *   Final opinions and orders made in the adjudication of cases.
        *   Statements of policy and interpretations adopted by the agency.
        *   Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public.
        *   Records that have been or are likely to be the subject of frequent FOIA requests.
    *   **Analysis:** Unless a specific complaint resolution rises to the level of a ""final opinion"" or ""order"" in an adjudication, or becomes a frequently requested record, FOIA does not compel proactive publication. Many internal complaint resolutions may not meet these criteria. While agencies *can* choose to publish more information proactively, FOIA doesn't *require* them to publish every complaint resolution. They would still be obligated to release them in response to a specific FOIA request, subject to applicable exemptions.

In summary, EOIR has a strong basis under FOIA to withhold identifying information of judges from complaint records (balancing privacy against public interest), to redact non-responsive information, and to decline proactive publication of all complaint resolutions. However, these actions can be challenged by requesters, and the specific facts of each case and the agency's justification are crucial.",[],,0.8298776149749756,15.419006482982176,21.14751566720693
"Can a U.S. lawful permanent resident successfully sue the U.S. State Department for unreasonable delay in processing an immigrant visa for their spouse under the Administrative Procedure Act, or for violating their Fifth Amendment due process rights, given a processing delay of under two years exacerbated by a global pandemic?","No, a U.S. lawful permanent resident cannot successfully sue the U.S. State Department for unreasonable delay or Fifth Amendment due process violations under these circumstances.

The Court dismissed the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claim for unreasonable delay because:
1.  The State Department's practice of processing visa applications on a first-in, first-out basis is considered a ""rule of reason"" for decision-making, and Congress has not established a specific statutory timetable for visa processing.
2.  A delay of approximately fourteen months (less than two years) is not deemed unreasonable as a matter of law, especially given the extraordinary backlog of cases (increasing from approximately 75,000 to 473,000) and the disruption to services caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.
3.  Granting relief would place the plaintiff ahead of other similarly situated applicants, interfering with the State Department's allocation of resources and its prioritization of ""mission critical"" functions during the pandemic.

5.  No impropriety or bad faith on the part of the agency was alleged.
Consequently, the mandamus action based on the APA claim also failed.

The Court dismissed the Fifth Amendment due process claims (both substantive and procedural) because:

2.  Since there is no protected liberty or property interest at stake in an immigrant visa and a process governed by a rule of reason exists for applicants, there can be no procedural due process violation.
The plaintiff's equal protection claim, also a Fifth Amendment claim, was dismissed as a matter of law for similar reasons.

Claims against the DHS defendants were dismissed as moot because the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) had already approved the I-130 petition and transferred it to the National Visa Center, completing its role in the process.

Here's a breakdown of why:

### I. Administrative Procedure Act (APA) Claim for Unreasonable Delay (5 U.S.C. § 706(1))

The APA allows courts to ""compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed."" While this is the most common avenue for challenging immigration processing delays, success is far from guaranteed, especially under the circumstances described.

**Factors Courts Consider for ""Unreasonable Delay"" (often referred to as the *TRAC* factors):**

1.  **Time Agency Has Taken:** A delay of ""under two years"" for an immigrant visa, while frustrating, is often not considered *per se* unreasonable in the context of complex immigration processes, even without a pandemic. Many visa categories have processing times that routinely exceed this.
2.  **Expedited Processing for Life/Safety:** Whether the petitioner or beneficiary has any interest in expedition that ""cries out for prompt resolution."" While family separation is difficult, it generally doesn't rise to the level of an immediate life-or-death emergency unless there are specific, documented medical or humanitarian crises.
3.  **Effect of Delay on Private Interests:** The LPR certainly has a significant private interest in reuniting with their spouse. However, courts balance this against the agency's operational realities.
4.  **Complexity of the Case:** Immigrant visa processing involves multiple steps, background checks, security clearances, and coordination between different agencies (USCIS, NVC, Consular Posts). This inherent complexity contributes to longer processing times.
5.  **Agency Resources and Priorities:** This is where the ""global pandemic"" factor becomes critical. Courts are highly deferential to agencies regarding resource allocation and operational challenges, especially when a global crisis significantly impacts their ability to process applications. The State Department can argue, and courts are likely to accept, that the pandemic caused unprecedented disruptions, reduced staffing, consular post closures, and shifting priorities, making delays unavoidable.
6.  **Extent to Which Agency Has Control Over Delay:** The pandemic was largely outside the State Department's control.

**Likelihood of Success for APA Claim:**

*   **Low to Moderate.** While an LPR can *file* such a lawsuit, successfully obtaining an order compelling the State Department to expedite processing within a specific timeframe is difficult.
*   Courts are generally reluctant to micromanage agency operations, particularly in the realm of foreign affairs and immigration, where national security and foreign policy considerations are often implicated.
*   The ""under two years"" delay, coupled with the pandemic's impact, provides the State Department with a strong defense against a claim of *unreasonable* delay. The court would likely find that the delay, while regrettable, is not unreasonable given the extraordinary circumstances.
*   Even if successful, the remedy is typically an order to *act* on the application, not necessarily to *approve* it or to do so within an unrealistic timeframe.

### II. Fifth Amendment Due Process Claim

This claim is **highly unlikely to succeed.**

**Key Principles:**

1.  **No Constitutional Right to a Visa:** Foreign nationals seeking to enter the U.S. from abroad generally have no constitutional right to a visa. The decision to grant a visa is considered a privilege, not a right, and is largely within the discretion of the executive branch.
2.  **Consular Nonreviewability Doctrine:** U.S. courts generally lack jurisdiction to review the decisions of consular officers regarding visa issuance or denial. This doctrine is a significant barrier to any challenge to visa processing.
3.  **LPR's Rights vs. Spouse's Rights:** While a U.S. citizen or LPR has a constitutional right to *petition* for their alien relatives, this right pertains to the *filing* of the petition (Form I-130) and its adjudication by USCIS. It does not extend to a constitutional right to the *grant* of the visa itself for the foreign national spouse, nor does it guarantee a specific processing timeline for the State Department's consular processing. Once the I-130 is approved, the process shifts to the State Department, where the foreign national spouse's lack of constitutional rights regarding entry becomes paramount.
4.  **Due Process Requires a Protected Interest:** For a Fifth Amendment due process claim to succeed, there must be a protected ""liberty"" or ""property"" interest at stake. Courts have consistently held that a foreign national abroad does not have such an interest in obtaining an immigrant visa. While the LPR has an interest in family unity, this interest has not been interpreted by courts as creating a constitutional right to compel the State Department to process a spouse's visa within a specific timeframe, especially when the spouse is outside the U.S.

**Likelihood of Success for Due Process Claim:**

*   **Extremely Low.** Courts have consistently rejected such claims, citing the plenary power of Congress over immigration and the consular nonreviewability doctrine. The pandemic context further complicates any argument that the delay constitutes a constitutional violation.

### Conclusion

Given a processing delay of under two years and the significant impact of a global pandemic, an LPR would face substantial legal hurdles in successfully suing the U.S. State Department.

*   The **APA claim** is possible to file, but success in compelling expedited action is unlikely due to judicial deference to agency operations, the reasonable nature of the delay in the context of immigration, and the mitigating factor of the pandemic.
*   The **Fifth Amendment due process claim** is highly unlikely to succeed due to the lack of a constitutional right to a visa for foreign nationals abroad and the consular nonreviewability doctrine.

While the LPR's frustration is understandable, the legal framework provides significant discretion to the State Department in visa processing, particularly during extraordinary global events.",[],,0.8411779999732971,14.101351850644413,28.09482884527617
"An EB-5 investor, John, filed a Form I-526 petition based on an investment in a limited partnership that included a ""Call Option"" allowing the general partner to repurchase John's interest for a fixed amount if the business was successful. USCIS denied John's petition, stating the Call Option meant his capital was not ""at risk"" and was a ""guaranteed return."" Concurrently, other investors in the same partnership, who submitted functionally identical petitions, received different denial notices from USCIS, citing various other reasons or fewer reasons for denial, with no explanation for the varied treatment. If John challenges USCIS's decision under the Administrative Procedure Act, what is the likely outcome regarding the ""at risk"" determination and the disparate treatment of petitions?","The court would likely find that USCIS's reasoning in denying John's petition on the grounds that the Call Option made his capital not ""at risk"" and constituted a ""guaranteed return"" was arbitrary and capricious, as the Call Option did not guarantee the return of capital regardless of the business's success or failure, nor did it provide the investor with any rights to exercise it. Additionally, the court would likely find that USCIS acted arbitrarily and capriciously by issuing different denial notices with varying reasons to functionally equivalent petitions without providing any explanation for the disparate treatment. The appropriate remedy would be to remand John's petition to USCIS for reconsideration consistent with the court's opinion, requiring USCIS to either treat all similar petitions in the same manner or sufficiently explain any reasons for treating them differently. The court would not likely order John's petition granted at this stage.",,,,,,,,"The court would likely find that USCIS's reasoning in denying John's petition on the grounds that the Call Option made his capital not ""at risk"" and constituted a ""guaranteed return"" was arbitrary and capricious, as the Call Option did not guarantee the return of capital regardless of the business's success or failure, nor did it provide the investor with any rights to exercise it.

The appropriate remedy would be to remand John's petition to USCIS for reconsideration consistent with the court's opinion, requiring USCIS to either treat all similar petitions in the same manner or sufficiently explain any reasons for treating them differently. The court would not likely order John's petition granted at this stage.","This scenario presents two distinct challenges under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA): the substantive ""at risk"" determination and the procedural issue of disparate treatment.

Here's a breakdown of the likely outcome:

### 1. ""At Risk"" Determination Regarding the Call Option

**Legal Standard:** Under the EB-5 program, an investor's capital must be ""at risk."" This means the capital must be subject to actual loss and not subject to any guarantee of return or redemption. USCIS interprets this strictly, requiring the investor to be fully exposed to the entrepreneurial risks of the commercial enterprise.

**Analysis of the Call Option:**
*   **USCIS's Argument:** USCIS would likely argue that a ""Call Option"" allowing the general partner to repurchase John's interest for a **fixed amount if the business was successful** constitutes a mechanism that limits John's risk and provides a form of ""guaranteed return"" (or at least a guaranteed floor for his return in successful scenarios). Even though John could still lose his money if the business fails, the fixed repurchase price in a successful scenario caps his potential loss and removes the full entrepreneurial risk associated with market valuation. USCIS often views any arrangement that provides a predetermined exit price, especially one contingent on success, as undermining the ""at risk"" requirement.
*   **John's Counter-Argument:** John might argue that the capital is still ""at risk"" because if the business fails, he loses everything. The call option is at the discretion of the general partner, not John, and it doesn't guarantee a return; it merely sets a price if the GP *chooses* to exercise it upon success. He is still exposed to the risk of the enterprise failing.
*   **Likely Outcome on this Specific Point:** Courts generally grant significant deference to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations, especially in complex areas like immigration. Given USCIS's strict interpretation of ""at risk,"" and the fact that the call option provides a **fixed amount** upon success, a court is **likely to uphold USCIS's determination** that John's capital was not fully ""at risk."" The ""fixed amount"" aspect, contingent on success, is often seen as a way to mitigate the investor's exposure to the full range of market fluctuations and entrepreneurial risk, even if the risk of total loss remains.

### 2. Disparate Treatment of Petitions

**Legal Standard:** The APA requires agency actions not to be ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law"" (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). A core principle of administrative law is that an agency must treat similarly situated individuals similarly or provide a reasoned explanation for departing from its own precedents or for treating identical cases differently. Failure to do so is a classic example of arbitrary and capricious action.

**Analysis of Disparate Treatment:**
*   **USCIS's Problem:** The fact that other investors in the *same partnership* with *functionally identical petitions* received *different denial notices* citing *various other reasons or fewer reasons*, with *no explanation for the varied treatment*, is a significant procedural flaw. This indicates a lack of consistency and reasoned decision-making by USCIS.
*   **John's Strong Argument:** John has a very strong argument that USCIS acted arbitrarily and capriciously. USCIS cannot apply different standards or provide inconsistent rationales for denying identical petitions without a clear, rational, and articulated explanation for the divergence. This undermines the fairness and predictability of the administrative process.
*   **Likely Outcome on this Specific Point:** A court is **highly likely to find that USCIS acted arbitrarily and capriciously** regarding the disparate treatment. The court would likely **remand the case back to USCIS** with instructions to:
    *   Provide a consistent and reasoned explanation for its decisions across all functionally identical petitions from the same partnership.
    *   Re-adjudicate John's petition (and potentially the others) in a manner that is consistent with its stated policies and previous decisions, or provide a clear justification for any deviation.

### Overall Likely Outcome

While John faces an uphill battle on the substantive ""at risk"" determination due to judicial deference to USCIS's interpretation, he has a **very strong case regarding the disparate treatment.**

The most probable outcome is that the court would:
1.  **Uphold USCIS's interpretation of the ""at risk"" requirement** as applied to the call option, finding it to be a permissible (though strict) interpretation of the regulations.
2.  **Overturn the denial based on the arbitrary and capricious nature of the disparate treatment.**
3.  **Remand John's petition to USCIS** for re-adjudication. This means USCIS would have to reconsider John's petition, but this time, it would be compelled to provide a consistent and reasoned explanation for its decision, aligning it with how it treats other identical petitions from the same project. This does not guarantee approval, but it forces USCIS to act lawfully and consistently.",[],,0.8334552049636841,15.371517857142859,27.714419642857166
A Minnesota county's jail receives an immigration detainer from U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) for an individual who has completed their state-level sentence and is scheduled for release.

Can the Minnesota county lawfully comply with this detainer request?,"No, a Minnesota county cannot lawfully hold an individual based solely on an immigration detainer if that person would otherwise be released from custody.

The continued detention of a person who would otherwise be released from custody constitutes an arrest. Neither Minnesota law nor federal law grants state and local officials the authority to make such an arrest based on an immigration detainer.","No, a Minnesota county generally **cannot lawfully comply** with an ICE detainer request to hold an individual beyond their scheduled release time solely based on the detainer.

Here's why:

1.  **ICE Detainers are Requests, Not Warrants:** An ICE detainer is a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for a local law enforcement agency to hold an individual. It is not a judicial warrant issued by a judge based on probable cause.
2.  **Fourth Amendment Concerns:** Holding an individual beyond their state-mandated release time without a judicial warrant or other independent probable cause determination by a judge is widely considered a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.
3.  **Lack of State Authority/Mandate:** Minnesota does not have a state law requiring local law enforcement agencies to comply with ICE detainers. In the absence of such a state mandate, and given the federal nature of immigration enforcement, local agencies are not compelled to act as federal immigration agents.
4.  **Civil Liability Risk:** Numerous court cases across the country have found that local jurisdictions can be held civilly liable for unlawfully detaining individuals based solely on ICE detainers. This exposes counties to potential lawsuits for damages. Many Minnesota county attorneys and sheriffs' associations have advised against complying with these voluntary holds due to this significant legal risk.

While a Minnesota county jail can lawfully *notify* ICE of an individual's impending release, holding them *beyond* their scheduled release time solely on the basis of an ICE detainer is generally not permissible and carries substantial legal risk for the county. If ICE wishes to take custody, they would typically need to present a judicial warrant or arrive to take custody *before* the individual's scheduled release.",[],,0.8500762581825256,14.501674876847293,27.987241379310348
"An asylum seeker from Country X arrived in the United States, claiming fear of persecution.

For purposes of determining whether an alien is subject to the firm resettlement bar to asylum, a viable and available offer to apply for permanent residence in a country of refuge is not negated by the alien’s unwillingness or reluctance to satisfy the terms for acceptance, nor by allowing their qualifications for permanent residence to lapse or purposefully becoming ineligible. The offer does not need to have been accepted, only available.",,,,,,,,"Yes, the asylum seeker can be barred from asylum.

The offer does not need to have been accepted, only available.","Yes, the asylum seeker *can* be barred from asylum in the U.S. based on firm resettlement in Country Y, given their stated reasons for not accepting the offer.

Here's why:

1.  **Definition of Firm Resettlement:** Under U.S. immigration law (8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(2)(A)(vi) and 8 C.F.R. § 208.15), an applicant is barred from asylum if they ""firmly resettled in any country before arriving in the United States."" Firm resettlement occurs if the applicant received an offer of permanent resident status, citizenship, or some other type of permanent residency, and could have remained in that country indefinitely.

2.  **Application to the Facts:**
    *   **Offer of Permanent Status:** Country Y offered ""permanent resident status through a humanitarian program."" This clearly meets the threshold of an offer of permanent residency.
    *   **Awareness and Opportunity:** The asylum seeker ""was aware of this offer"" and ""chose not to complete the process."" This indicates they had the opportunity to accept the offer and could have remained in Country Y indefinitely.
    *   **Reasons for Not Accepting:**
        *   **Perceived costs and time:** These are generally not considered valid reasons to negate a firm resettlement offer. The law expects an asylum seeker to take reasonable steps to secure safety in a third country if such an opportunity exists.
        *   **General fear of crime in Country Y:** This is the most critical point. Asylum requires a fear of persecution *on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion*. A ""general fear of crime"" does not meet this specific standard. While unfortunate, it does not mean that Country Y was unable to provide a safe haven from the *persecution* the individual was fleeing from Country X. The standard for firm resettlement does not require the third country to be entirely free of crime or to be a preferred destination; it only requires that the individual could have found permanent safety there from the specific persecution they claim.

**Conclusion:**

Because Country Y offered permanent resident status, and the asylum seeker was aware of and chose not to complete the process for reasons that do not rise to the level of a new fear of persecution or an inability to access the offered status, an immigration judge or asylum officer would likely find that the asylum seeker firmly resettled (or could have firmly resettled) in Country Y.

"Under North Carolina law, can a trial court order a custodial parent to send children to a foreign country for visitation with a non-custodial parent who has been deported, particularly when there is a history of domestic violence against the custodial parent and concerns about the children's immigration status?","Yes, a North Carolina trial court can order children to travel to a foreign country for visitation with a non-custodial parent who has been deported, even with a history of domestic violence against the custodial parent and immigration concerns.

A statutory provision that prevents a party's absence or relocation due to domestic violence from weighing against them in custody determinations does not apply to the custodial parent's fear of future relocation to the foreign country for visitation.",,,,,,,,"Yes, a North Carolina trial court can order children to travel to a foreign country for visitation with a non-custodial parent who has been deported, even with a history of domestic violence against the custodial parent and immigration concerns.

Here's a breakdown of the factors and why such an order would be improbable:

1.  **Best Interest of the Child is Paramount:** In all custody and visitation matters, North Carolina courts must prioritize the ""best interest of the child."" This is the overarching legal standard. The combination of factors presented here creates significant concerns for the children's safety, well-being, and stability, making such an order contrary to their best interest.

2.  **History of Domestic Violence:**
    *   **NC Law Mandate:** North Carolina General Statutes (e.g., N.C.G.S. § 50-13.2(a)) explicitly require courts to consider evidence of domestic violence when making custody and visitation decisions.
    *   **Safety Concerns:** A history of domestic violence against the custodial parent raises grave concerns about the safety of the children if they are sent to a foreign country with the perpetrator. The court would be extremely hesitant to place children in a situation where they might be exposed to violence or where the custodial parent might be coerced or endangered in facilitating the visitation.
    *   **Risk of Abduction:** A history of domestic violence is a significant risk factor for international parental child abduction. Courts are very wary of ordering children to travel internationally, especially to countries that are not signatories to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, or where the legal system might not effectively enforce U.S. custody orders. Even if the country is a signatory, the history of violence would heighten the court's concern.

3.  **Deported Non-Custodial Parent:**
    *   **Inability to Enter U.S.:** The fact that the non-custodial parent (NCP) has been deported means they cannot legally enter the United States. This forces the issue of international travel for visitation.
    *   **Reason for Deportation:** The court would likely inquire into the reasons for deportation. If it was due to criminal activity, especially involving violence or moral turpitude, it would further weigh against ordering international visitation.

4.  **Children's Immigration Status Concerns:**
    *   **Risk of Inability to Return:** If the children are not U.S. citizens (e.g., they are green card holders, have temporary status, or are undocumented), sending them to a foreign country could jeopardize their ability to legally re-enter the United States. This could lead to them being stranded abroad, separated from their custodial parent, and losing their home, school, and community in North Carolina. This would be a severe detriment to their best interest.
    *   **Passport/Visa Issues:** The children might not have the necessary travel documents, or obtaining them could be complicated, especially if the NCP's cooperation is required and they are uncooperative or hostile.

5.  **Jurisdictional and Enforcement Issues:**
    *   **Loss of Control:** Once children leave the United States, a North Carolina court's ability to enforce its orders and ensure the children's safe return is significantly diminished.
    *   **Foreign Legal Systems:** The court would have to consider the legal system of the foreign country, its ability to protect the children, and its willingness to enforce U.S. custody orders.

**Conclusion:**

Given the confluence of these serious factors – the paramount concern for the children's best interest, the history of domestic violence (a major red flag for safety and abduction risk), the non-custodial parent's deportation, and the potential immigration complications for the children – a North Carolina trial court would almost certainly **deny** an order requiring the custodial parent to send the children to a foreign country for visitation. The risks to the children's safety, well-being, and legal status would be deemed too high. The court might explore alternative arrangements, such as virtual visitation, but direct international visitation under these circumstances is highly improbable.",[],,0.8502771854400635,15.51131090080617,25.67732153288938

For the challenge to the denial of voluntary departure, the record would be remanded to the Immigration Judge for further factual findings regarding the favorable and unfavorable factors relevant to that discretionary determination.","A U.S. federal court would likely decide these arguments as follows:

---

### 1. California Penal Code § 245(a)(4) as a Crime Involving Moral Turpitude (CIMT)

**Decision:** The federal court would **very likely find** that a conviction under California Penal Code § 245(a)(4) for assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury is a Crime Involving Moral Turpitude (CIMT).

**Reasoning:**

*   **Legal Standard for CIMT:** A CIMT is generally defined as a crime that involves ""inherent baseness, vileness, or depravity contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general."" Federal courts apply the ""categorical approach"" or, if the statute is divisible, the ""modified categorical approach"" to determine if a state conviction is a CIMT.
*   **Analysis of PC § 245(a)(4):** This statute criminalizes assault ""by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury.""
    *   **Categorical Approach:** Under the categorical approach, the court would look at the ""least culpable conduct"" criminalized by the statute. Even the least culpable conduct under § 245(a)(4) involves the intentional application of force that is *likely* to cause serious physical harm. This element elevates the offense beyond simple assault (which is generally not a CIMT) into the realm of aggravated assault.
    *   **Precedent:** Federal courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) have consistently held that aggravated assault, especially when it involves the intent to cause serious bodily harm or the use of force likely to cause such harm, constitutes a CIMT. The deliberate use of force with a high probability of causing severe injury demonstrates the ""inherent baseness"" required for a CIMT.
*   **Conclusion:** The nature of the offense, specifically the ""force likely to produce great bodily injury"" element, strongly indicates a disregard for the physical integrity of another person that is contrary to accepted moral standards. Therefore, the federal court would almost certainly uphold a finding that this conviction is a CIMT, making the individual ineligible for cancellation of removal (unless a specific exception, like the petty offense exception, applies, which is unlikely for this type of felony).

---

### 2. Defective Notice to Appear (NTA) for Lacking Time and Date

**Decision:** The federal court would **reject** the argument that the initial NTA defect (lacking time and date) warrants termination of removal proceedings, given that a subsequent Notice of Hearing (NOH) provided this information and the individual appeared.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Legal Background:**
    *   **_Pereira v. Sessions_ (2018) and _Niz-Chavez v. Garland_ (2021):** The Supreme Court held that an NTA that does not specify the time and date of the initial hearing does not trigger the ""stop-time rule"" for cancellation of removal purposes. These cases focused on the *eligibility* for cancellation of removal, specifically the accrual of physical presence.
    *   **Jurisdiction vs. Stop-Time Rule:** Federal courts, including the Supreme Court in *Niz-Chavez*, have clarified that the lack of a time and date in the initial NTA does *not* deprive the immigration court of jurisdiction over the removal proceedings, especially when a subsequent NOH provides the missing information and the individual appears.
    *   **Cure of Defect:** The overwhelming consensus among federal circuit courts (e.g., the Fifth Circuit in *DHS v. Lora*, and similar rulings in other circuits) is that a subsequent NOH that provides the time and date, followed by the alien's appearance, cures any jurisdictional defect arising from an incomplete initial NTA. The purpose of the NTA is to provide notice and initiate proceedings; the NOH ensures due process by providing specific hearing details.
*   **Application to the Case:** The individual received a subsequent NOH with the time and date and appeared at all scheduled hearings. This demonstrates that the individual received proper notice of the proceedings and had the opportunity to be heard. The immigration court therefore had jurisdiction.
*   **Conclusion:** The federal court would find that the immigration court properly exercised jurisdiction over the removal proceedings, and the NTA defect was cured by the subsequent NOH and the individual's appearance.

---

### 3. Denial of Voluntary Departure

**Decision:** The federal court would **likely affirm** the denial of voluntary departure.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Legal Standard for Voluntary Departure:** Voluntary departure is a discretionary form of relief. The immigration judge (IJ) and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) have broad discretion in granting or denying it.
*   **Standard of Review:** A federal court reviews the denial of voluntary departure for ""abuse of discretion."" This is a highly deferential standard. The court does not reweigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the agency. Instead, it examines whether the agency's decision was arbitrary, capricious, based on an error of law, or unsupported by substantial evidence.
*   **Factors for Denial:** A conviction for a serious offense, especially a CIMT like PC § 245(a)(4), is a significant negative factor that weighs heavily against a grant of voluntary departure. Such a conviction often precludes a finding of ""good moral character,"" which is a statutory requirement for voluntary departure. Even if good moral character is found, the severity of the crime provides a strong discretionary basis for denial.
*   **Application to the Case:** Given the individual's conviction for assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury (a likely CIMT), the IJ and BIA would have a rational and legally sound basis to deny voluntary departure. This serious criminal history would be a compelling negative factor outweighing any potential positive equities.
*   **Conclusion:** The federal court would almost certainly find that the IJ/BIA did not abuse their discretion in denying voluntary departure. The conviction for PC § 245(a)(4) provides a sufficient basis for the exercise of discretion to deny this relief.

---

**Overall Summary:**

A U.S. federal court would likely rule against the individual on all three arguments. The conviction under PC § 245(a)(4) would be deemed a CIMT, making the individual ineligible for cancellation of removal. The NTA defect would be considered cured by the subsequent Notice of Hearing and the individual's appearance, thus preserving the immigration court's jurisdiction. Finally, the denial of voluntary departure would likely be upheld as a valid exercise of discretion by the immigration authorities, given the serious nature of the conviction.",[],,0.8162182569503784,14.667158106747234,29.20953877139982
"A North Carolina resident is arrested by local law enforcement on state charges and placed in the county jail. After these state charges are dismissed, the Sheriff continues to hold the individual based solely on an immigration detainer and arrest warrant issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Sheriff's office has a 287(g) agreement with ICE, authorizing deputies to perform immigration enforcement functions. The resident files a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in state superior court, arguing that their continued detention is unlawful and that the immigration process is invalid. Does the state superior court have the authority to grant the habeas corpus petition and order the resident's release?","No. The North Carolina Supreme Court has held that if an application for a writ of habeas corpus alleges that the petitioner is being held pursuant to an immigration-related arrest warrant or detainer by a sheriff who is a party to a 287(g) agreement with the federal government, the state trial court must summarily deny the application. If the application does not initially reveal this, but the sheriff's return claims the petitioner is held under such federal authority via a 287(g) agreement, the trial court must then deny the request for discharge. State courts lack the authority to inquire into the validity of federal immigration processes or to interfere with detentions made under a 287(g) agreement, as such matters fall under exclusive federal jurisdiction.

The remedy for any alleged unlawful imprisonment in these circumstances lies exclusively with federal courts.","No, the North Carolina state superior court likely **does not have the authority** to grant the habeas corpus petition and order the resident's release under these circumstances.

Here's why:

1.  **Exclusive Federal Jurisdiction over Immigration:** Immigration law is an area of exclusive federal jurisdiction. Challenges to the validity of federal immigration detainers, arrest warrants issued by DHS, or the underlying immigration process itself fall squarely within federal authority. State courts generally lack jurisdiction to review the merits of federal immigration decisions or to issue habeas relief against federal immigration authorities or their agents acting under federal authority.

2.  **Nature of the Detention:** Once the state charges are dismissed, the individual's continued detention is based *solely* on federal immigration authority (the DHS detainer and arrest warrant). Even though the individual is physically held in a county jail by a county sheriff, the legal basis for that detention is now entirely federal.

3.  **287(g) Agreement:** The 287(g) agreement further solidifies the federal nature of the detention. Under a 287(g) agreement, authorized local law enforcement officers (like the deputies in the Sheriff's office) are deputized to perform certain immigration enforcement functions *as if they were federal immigration officers*. When they act under this authority, they are essentially acting as agents of the federal government. Therefore, the detention, while carried out by local officials, is legally a federal immigration detention.

4.  **Proper Forum for Challenge:** The proper forum for challenging the legality of a federal immigration detainer, an immigration arrest warrant, or the validity of the underlying immigration process is in **federal court**, typically through a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241.

While state courts have general habeas corpus jurisdiction to challenge unlawful detention, this jurisdiction does not extend to reviewing the merits of federal immigration decisions or ordering the release of individuals held solely on the basis of valid federal immigration authority. The resident's argument that the ""immigration process is invalid"" is a federal question that must be adjudicated in a federal court.",[],,0.8553662300109863,17.41259061833689,12.842425373134375
"A lawful permanent resident, who is a non-English speaker with significant ties to his country of origin, pleads guilty to an aggravated felony that mandates deportation. His attorney did not explicitly advise him of the mandatory deportation consequences, and he did not request an interpreter during the plea hearing. He claims he did not fully understand the proceedings and that avoiding deportation was his primary concern, despite telling the judge at the time of the plea that he understood the potential for deportation. The trial court advised him of the possibility of deportation as required by statute, and he responded affirmatively when asked if he understood. He seeks to withdraw his plea four years later, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel and a violation of his right to an interpreter. Should the trial court grant his motion to withdraw his guilty plea?","No. A trial court should not grant a post-sentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea unless the defendant demonstrates a ""manifest injustice,"" a showing that rests on the defendant to prove extraordinary circumstances.

Here's a breakdown of the legal arguments and why the motion is likely to fail:

1.  **Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (IAC) - *Padilla v. Kentucky*:**
    *   **Deficient Performance:** Under *Padilla v. Kentucky*, defense counsel has an affirmative duty to advise non-citizen clients about the immigration consequences of a guilty plea, especially when those consequences are ""truly clear."" Pleading guilty to an aggravated felony *mandates* deportation. Therefore, counsel's failure to explicitly advise the defendant of the *mandatory* deportation consequences likely constitutes deficient performance.
    *   **Prejudice:** To establish IAC, the defendant must also show prejudice, meaning there is a ""reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.""
        *   **Against Prejudice:** The defendant told the judge at the time of the plea that he understood the *potential* for deportation. The trial court also advised him of the *possibility* of deportation as required by statute, and he responded affirmatively. This significantly weakens his claim that he would have acted differently if he had known it was mandatory. While ""potential"" is different from ""mandatory,"" his affirmation of understanding at the time suggests he was aware of a significant risk and proceeded anyway. It's difficult to prove four years later that he would have rejected the plea and risked a trial (and potentially a harsher sentence) if he had known the deportation was mandatory, especially when he accepted the ""potential"" risk.
        *   **Delay:** The four-year delay in seeking to withdraw the plea is a substantial factor against him. Motions to withdraw guilty pleas are generally disfavored after sentencing, and the longer the delay, the higher the burden on the defendant to show a ""manifest injustice."" His claim that avoiding deportation was his primary concern, despite his affirmative responses to the judge, is undermined by this delay.

2.  **Violation of Right to an Interpreter:**
    *   **Defendant's Burden:** While non-English speakers have a right to an interpreter to ensure due process and understanding of proceedings, the burden often falls on the defendant or their counsel to request one if needed. The defendant *did not request an interpreter*.
    *   **Court's Actions:** The trial court fulfilled its duty by advising him of the possibility of deportation and asking if he understood, to which he responded affirmatively. The court had no reason to believe he did not understand the proceedings, especially given his affirmative responses.
    *   **Retrospective Claim:** His claim four years later that he ""did not fully understand the proceedings"" is self-serving and difficult to prove, especially when contradicted by his statements to the judge at the time of the plea.

**Conclusion:**

While counsel's performance regarding the mandatory nature of deportation was likely deficient under *Padilla*, the defendant faces significant hurdles in proving prejudice. His affirmative responses to the judge regarding his understanding of the *potential* for deportation, coupled with his failure to request an interpreter and the substantial four-year delay in seeking to withdraw the plea, strongly weigh against granting his motion. Courts are generally reluctant to allow defendants to withdraw pleas years later based on claims contradicted by the record at the time of the plea. The standard for withdrawing a plea post-sentencing is high, requiring a showing of ""manifest injustice,"" which is unlikely to be met here.",[],,0.8370624780654907,13.931792700729932,34.22050656934309
"A U.S. citizen sponsors his alien spouse for immigration by signing a USCIS Form I-864 Affidavit of Support. At the time, they have a minor child who is a U.S. citizen and was born before the affidavit was signed, and this child is not listed on the affidavit. The couple later separates, and the sponsored spouse seeks monetary damages from the sponsor for breach of the Affidavit of Support. When calculating the sponsor's obligation, what household size should the court use for the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) Guidelines, and if the spouse also loaned the sponsor money in a foreign currency, in what currency should the repayment be awarded?","The court erred by using the FPL Guidelines for a two-person household. The sponsor only promised to support the alien spouse in the Affidavit of Support, and the U.S. citizen child was not listed on the form as an immigrant intended to be sponsored, as the Affidavit of Support does not apply to U.S. citizens. Therefore, the court should calculate the damages using the FPL Guidelines for a one-person household.

1.  **Household Size for Federal Poverty Level (FPL) Guidelines:**
    The court should use a household size of **three (3)** for calculating the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) Guidelines.

    *   **Reasoning:** The USCIS Form I-864 Affidavit of Support requires the sponsor to demonstrate an income at least 125% of the FPL for their household. The ""household size"" for this purpose includes:
        *   The sponsor themselves.
        *   The sponsored immigrant(s) (in this case, the spouse).
        *   Any other dependents listed on the sponsor's most recent federal income tax return.
        *   Any other immigrants previously sponsored by the sponsor on an I-864 who are still subject to the affidavit.
        *   **Crucially, any minor children of the sponsor, even if not explicitly listed on the I-864 or the tax return, if they are financially dependent on the sponsor.** The FPL is designed to reflect the actual number of individuals the sponsor is legally obligated to support. Since the minor child is a U.S. citizen and was born before the affidavit was signed, they are a dependent of the sponsor and must be included in the household size calculation for determining the sponsor's financial obligation under the I-864.

2.  **Currency for Repayment of the Loan:**
    The repayment for the loan made in a foreign currency should be awarded in **U.S. dollars**, converted from the foreign currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the date the **judgment is entered** by the court.

    *   **Reasoning:** While the loan was made in a foreign currency, U.S. courts typically issue judgments in U.S. dollars. When an obligation is denominated in a foreign currency, the court will convert that amount into U.S. dollars. The general rule in U.S. courts for converting foreign currency obligations is to use the exchange rate on the date the judgment is entered, rather than the date the loan was made or the date of the breach. This ""judgment day rule"" aims to make the plaintiff whole at the time the court makes its final determination.",[],,0.8120527863502502,9.719716216216217,55.0325472972973

USCIS's interpretation that the degree must be ""in a specific specialty that is directly related to the proffered position"" is consistent with the statute.

Here's a breakdown of the considerations:

1.  **The ""Specific Specialty"" Requirement:**
    The core of the ""specialty occupation"" definition is that it requires ""a theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge"" and ""a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) is normally the minimum requirement for entry into the particular position."" USCIS looks for a direct nexus between the degree and the occupation.

2.  **Challenges with a Generalized BBA:**
    *   **Lack of Depth:** A generalized BBA often covers a broad range of business functions (marketing, finance, management, HR, operations, accounting) without providing deep specialization in any single area. USCIS has historically been skeptical of degrees that are too general, arguing they don't provide the ""highly specialized knowledge"" required for many H-1B roles.
    *   **Difficulty in Demonstrating Nexus:** If the proposed H-1B occupation is, for example, a ""Financial Analyst,"" a BBA with a concentration in Finance would likely be a strong match. However, a *generalized* BBA might struggle to demonstrate that it provides the specific theoretical and practical knowledge required for that particular financial role, especially if the curriculum didn't include advanced finance courses.

3.  **When a Generalized BBA *Might* Satisfy the Requirement:**
    Despite the challenges, there are situations where a generalized BBA *could* potentially satisfy the requirement:

    *   **Concentration/Major within the BBA:** If the ""generalized"" BBA actually includes a significant concentration or major in a specific field directly related to the H-1B occupation (e.g., a BBA with a concentration in Information Systems for an IT role, or a BBA with a strong marketing track for a marketing role), the petitioner can emphasize this specialization.
    *   **Nature of the Occupation:** If the H-1B occupation itself is genuinely broad and requires a *general* understanding of various business principles, and the industry standard for that specific role is indeed a general business degree, it might be acceptable. However, such roles are often scrutinized to ensure they are not merely administrative or managerial positions that don't require ""highly specialized knowledge.""
    *   **Progressive Work Experience:** If the beneficiary has a generalized BBA *and* significant, progressive work experience in a specialized field directly related to the H-1B occupation, this experience can sometimes be used to argue that the beneficiary possesses the ""equivalent of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty."" This typically requires a credential evaluation that equates the experience to a specialized degree.
    *   **Detailed Job Duties and Curriculum Analysis:** The petitioner must meticulously describe the job duties, demonstrating how they require the theoretical and practical application of knowledge gained from the BBA curriculum. A detailed analysis of the BBA transcript and course descriptions, showing how specific courses relate to the job duties, is crucial.
    *   **Expert Opinion Letter:** In challenging cases, an expert opinion letter from a university professor or industry expert can help explain how the generalized BBA, combined with the specific job duties, meets the ""specific specialty"" requirement.

**Conclusion:**

While a generalized bachelor's degree in Business Administration is not automatically disqualified, it faces higher scrutiny from USCIS compared to a more specialized degree (e.g., a B.S. in Computer Science for a Software Engineer role). The petitioner bears the burden of proof to clearly demonstrate a direct and strong nexus between the specific duties of the proposed H-1B occupation and the highly specialized knowledge gained through the generalized BBA curriculum. This often requires a robust petition that highlights any concentrations, relevant coursework, and/or supplementary experience to overcome the perception of a lack of ""specific specialty.""",[],,0.8406619429588318,17.927904490377767,13.766582323592331

The plaintiff countered, requesting a transfer to the District of Maryland if D.C. was found to be an improper venue, citing his counsel's bar admissions and USCIS's location. Given these circumstances, to which district should the court transfer the case?","The court should transfer the case to the District of Maryland. The District of Columbia is not a proper venue because USCIS does not reside there, the events giving rise to the claim (application filings and delays) occurred in Virginia, and the plaintiff resides in Virginia. Although the Eastern District of Virginia would also be a proper venue as the plaintiff resides there and the claim arose there, the court decided to transfer to the District of Maryland. This decision was based on the convenience of the parties and the interests of justice, considering that USCIS resides in Maryland, and the plaintiff's current counsel is barred in D.C. and Maryland but not in Virginia, thereby avoiding significant inconvenience and expense for the plaintiff.",,,,,,,,"The court should transfer the case to the District of Maryland.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  **Improper Venue in D.C.:** The defendant (USCIS) moved to transfer or dismiss for improper venue, implying that the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is not a proper venue. This is common for federal agencies whose headquarters for venue purposes might be in the state where they are incorporated or primarily located, rather than just where they have an office in D.C.

2.  **Proper Venue Options:**
    *   **Eastern District of Virginia (EDVA):** This is a proper venue because the plaintiff resides there. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2), venue is proper in ""a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred."" For an action to compel agency action, the plaintiff's residence is often considered a place where the impact of the agency's inaction is felt, and where the plaintiff's interactions with the agency might have originated. USCIS also requested this district.
    *   **District of Maryland (D. Md.):** This is also a proper venue because USCIS is headquartered there. Under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1), venue is proper in ""a judicial district in which any defendant resides."" For a federal agency, its residence is typically its principal office or headquarters. The plaintiff also specifically requested this district as an alternative.

3.  **Transfer Statute (28 U.S.C. § 1406(a)):** Since D.C. is likely an improper venue, the court would operate under 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a), which allows a court to ""transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought."" Both EDVA and D. Md. are districts where the case ""could have been brought.""

4.  **Balancing Factors and Plaintiff's Preference:**
    *   While USCIS requested EDVA, the plaintiff, when faced with improper venue, specifically requested the District of Maryland. A plaintiff's choice of forum, even a secondary one, is often given weight.
    *   The District of Maryland is the actual headquarters of USCIS, making it a natural and convenient forum for the defendant agency to litigate.
    *   The plaintiff's counsel's bar admissions in Maryland also support this choice, indicating practical convenience for the plaintiff.

Given that both districts are proper venues, and the plaintiff explicitly requested the District of Maryland (citing valid reasons like the defendant's location and counsel's convenience) as an alternative to the improper D.C. venue, the court would likely honor that request.",[],,0.8374820351600647,9.398560872624913,51.755306122448985
"In a motion for attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), what level of evidence is required to establish a party's net worth, particularly when the administrative record contains information suggesting a higher net worth than a bare affidavit attests?","To receive an EAJA fee award, a party must demonstrate that their net worth did not exceed $2,000,000 at the time the civil action was filed. While an affidavit alone may sometimes be sufficient, courts must assess the entire record to determine if the net worth requirement is met, especially when the record contains significant information about the party's financial situation. The party seeking the award bears the burden of proof and must show that their testimony is consistent with the balance of the record. Therefore, a bare assertion in an affidavit, made under penalty of perjury, that one's net worth has never exceeded the threshold is insufficient if other record evidence raises concerns about its accuracy or if the party fails to provide documentation regarding the value of their assets and liabilities. In such a situation, the court may deny that part of the motion without prejudice and order supplemental briefing to provide the necessary documentation.",,,,,,,,"To receive an EAJA fee award, a party must demonstrate that their net worth did not exceed $2,000,000 at the time the civil action was filed.

In such a situation, the court may deny that part of the motion without prejudice and order supplemental briefing to provide the necessary documentation.","In a motion for attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), the level of evidence required to establish a party's net worth depends significantly on whether the government challenges the applicant's assertion and, critically, whether the administrative record contains conflicting information.

Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Initial Showing (Prima Facie Evidence):**
    *   **General Rule:** Typically, a sworn affidavit from the applicant (or a knowledgeable representative for an entity) attesting to their net worth, detailing assets and liabilities, is sufficient to make a *prima facie* showing of eligibility. This affidavit should provide specific figures that allow for the calculation of net worth and demonstrate that it falls below the EAJA thresholds ($2 million for individuals, $7 million for businesses/organizations with fewer than 500 employees).
    *   **Purpose:** This initial affidavit creates a rebuttable presumption of eligibility.

2.  **When the Administrative Record Suggests a Higher Net Worth or the Government Challenges:**
    *   **Increased Scrutiny:** If the government challenges the applicant's net worth, or if the administrative record itself contains information that contradicts the affidavit or suggests a higher net worth, the applicant cannot simply rely on a ""bare affidavit."" The level of evidence required increases significantly.
    *   **Burden Shift:** While the initial burden is on the applicant to allege eligibility, once a *prima facie* case is made, the burden shifts to the government to *disprove* eligibility. However, if the government points to specific conflicting evidence (especially from the administrative record), the applicant then has a responsibility to provide more detailed and convincing evidence to resolve the discrepancy.
    *   **Required Evidence:** In such cases, the applicant will likely need to provide:
        *   **Detailed Financial Statements:** Balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements for the relevant period.
        *   **Tax Returns:** Federal and state income tax returns.
        *   **Asset Valuations:** Documentation supporting the valuation of significant assets, particularly real estate, business interests, or other substantial holdings. This might include appraisals, property tax assessments, or market analyses. Assets are generally valued at fair market value, not historical cost, unless they are depreciated assets used in a business where historical cost (less depreciation) is more appropriate.
        *   **Liability Documentation:** Loan agreements, mortgage statements, and other documents substantiating reported liabilities.
        *   **Bank Statements:** To verify cash and liquid assets.
        *   **Explanation of Discrepancies:** The applicant must directly address and explain any discrepancies between their affidavit, the administrative record, and any other financial documents. Simply ignoring the conflicting information will likely lead to a denial of fees.
        *   **Testimony:** In rare cases, if there's a significant factual dispute, live testimony from the applicant or a financial expert might be required.

3.  **Standard of Proof:**
    *   While the initial affidavit is a *prima facie* showing, the ultimate determination of net worth, when challenged, is typically made by a **preponderance of the evidence**. This means the applicant must present enough credible evidence to convince the court or agency that it is ""more likely than not"" that their net worth falls below the statutory threshold.

**In summary:** A bare affidavit is generally sufficient for an initial showing. However, if the administrative record contains information suggesting a higher net worth, or if the government otherwise challenges the applicant's eligibility, the applicant must provide **detailed, verifiable, and credible financial documentation** to substantiate their net worth claim and reconcile any apparent discrepancies. Failure to do so will likely result in a finding that the applicant has not met their burden of proving EAJA eligibility.",[],,0.8196021318435669,16.99291218637993,14.642701612903267
"A U.S. citizen, convicted of specified offenses against a minor, filed a Form I-130 Petition for Alien Relative on behalf of his spouse. The USCIS denied the petition, concluding in its ""sole and unreviewable discretion"" that the citizen failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt he posed no risk to his spouse, as required by the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. The citizen and his spouse then sued in federal district court, alleging the denial was arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and violated their due process and right to marry. Does the district court have subject matter jurisdiction to review the USCIS's discretionary ""no-risk"" determination, even when the plaintiffs characterize their claims as legal and constitutional issues?","No, the district court does not have subject matter jurisdiction to review the USCIS's discretionary ""no-risk"" determination.

Therefore, the district court correctly concluded it lacked jurisdiction.","This is a complex question involving the interplay of specific statutory bars to judicial review and the general principle of judicial review for constitutional claims.

Here's a breakdown:

**1. The Adam Walsh Act's Jurisdictional Bar**

The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (AWA) significantly restricts judicial review of these ""no-risk"" determinations. Specifically, 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(1)(A)(viii)(II) states:

> ""The Secretary of Homeland Security, in the Secretary's **sole and unreviewable discretion**, may waive the application of subclause (I) [the general prohibition on approving petitions for certain offenders] if the Secretary determines that the petitioner poses no risk to the beneficiary.""

This language, ""sole and unreviewable discretion,"" is a very strong statutory preclusion of judicial review for the *substance* of the Secretary's ""no-risk"" determination. Courts generally interpret such language to mean that they cannot second-guess the agency's factual findings or the exercise of its judgment in making that specific discretionary decision. Claims that the decision was ""arbitrary and capricious"" or an ""abuse of discretion"" typically fall squarely within this bar when applied to the *merits* of the discretionary finding.

**2. The Exception for Constitutional Claims and Questions of Law (8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D))**

However, there's a crucial statutory exception in immigration law. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D) states:

> ""Nothing in subparagraph (B) or (C), or in any other provision of this chapter (other than this section) which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of **constitutional claims or questions of law** raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.""

While this provision primarily refers to petitions for review in the court of appeals, courts generally apply its underlying principle to district court jurisdiction as well, especially when the claim is not one that would typically go directly to the court of appeals (like a final order of removal). The Supreme Court has affirmed that courts retain jurisdiction to review constitutional challenges to agency action, even when a statute purports to bar review.

**Applying this to the Scenario:**

*   **""Arbitrary and Capricious"" / ""Abuse of Discretion"" (Substantive Review):** The district court would **not** have subject matter jurisdiction to review the *substance* of the USCIS's ""no-risk"" determination under the guise of these claims. The ""sole and unreviewable discretion"" language in the AWA directly precludes such review of the merits of the discretionary decision. The court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency on whether the petitioner actually poses a risk.

*   **Due Process Claims:** The district court **would likely** have subject matter jurisdiction to review *procedural* due process claims. For example, if the plaintiffs alleged that USCIS failed to provide them with notice, an opportunity to be heard, or used an unconstitutionally biased decision-maker, these would be reviewable constitutional claims. The court would examine whether the *process* by which the decision was made was constitutionally adequate, not the *outcome* of the ""no-risk"" determination itself.

*   **Right to Marry Claims:** The district court **would likely** have subject matter jurisdiction to review claims that the AWA itself, or its application in a particular manner, unconstitutionally infringes on the fundamental right to marry. This would be a challenge to the *constitutionality of the statute* or the *agency's interpretation of its statutory authority* (a question of law), rather than a challenge to the discretionary ""no-risk"" finding. For example, if the plaintiffs argued that the ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" standard was unconstitutional as applied to their right to marry, that would be a reviewable constitutional claim.

**Conclusion:**

The district court **would generally not have subject matter jurisdiction** to review the USCIS's discretionary ""no-risk"" determination on its merits (i.e., whether the agency was correct in concluding the petitioner posed a risk). Claims of ""arbitrary and capricious"" or ""abuse of discretion"" challenging the *substance* of that finding would be barred by the AWA's ""sole and unreviewable discretion"" language.

However, the district court **would likely have subject matter jurisdiction** to review genuine **constitutional claims** (e.g., procedural due process violations, or challenges to the constitutionality of the AWA itself as it impacts the right to marry) or **questions of law** (e.g., whether USCIS misinterpreted the statute or exceeded its statutory authority). Courts are careful to distinguish between a disguised attempt to review the merits of a discretionary decision and a legitimate constitutional or legal challenge to the agency's process or statutory interpretation.",[],,0.8553024530410767,15.857613543714933,25.530639777468735
"Maria, a Mexican citizen, entered the United States on a TD visa, which required her to maintain a foreign residence and not intend to establish permanent residence. She later began the process of seeking lawful permanent resident status through a Petition for Alien Relative filed by her U.S. citizen sister. While this petition was pending, she filed for dissolution of her marriage in an Arizona court. The trial court dismissed her petition, ruling that her TD visa status, and the federal law associated with it, legally precluded her from establishing domicile in Arizona. Is the trial court's dismissal of her divorce petition on the basis of federal preemption correct?","No, the trial court's dismissal of Maria's divorce petition based on federal preemption is incorrect. The Arizona Court of Appeals vacated the dismissal, holding that federal law does not prevent a holder of a TN or TD visa from establishing an Arizona domicile if they have begun seeking an immigrant visa or adjustment of status that could lead to permanent residency. Congress contemplated that these visa holders might be able to establish a United States domicile by following these processes. Allowing an Arizona court to exercise jurisdiction in this dissolution proceeding would not alter Maria's immigration status or limit remedies under federal immigration law. The case was remanded to the trial court to determine whether Maria satisfies the domicile requirement under Arizona law by weighing relevant factors, including her immigration status and intent.",,,,,,,,"No, the trial court's dismissal of Maria's divorce petition based on federal preemption is incorrect.

The case was remanded to the trial court to determine whether Maria satisfies the domicile requirement under Arizona law by weighing relevant factors, including her immigration status and intent.","No, the trial court's dismissal of Maria's divorce petition on the basis of federal preemption is **likely incorrect**.

Here's why:

1.  **Domicile for Divorce vs. Immigration Intent:**
    *   **Domicile for divorce purposes** generally requires two elements: (1) physical presence in the state, and (2) an intent to remain in that state indefinitely. It does not necessarily require an intent to become a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident (green card holder).
    *   **TD visa requirements** prohibit the intent to establish *permanent residence* in the United States *for immigration purposes*. This is a different legal standard than the intent required for state law domicile.

2.  **The *Elkins v. Moreno* Precedent:**
    *   The U.S. Supreme Court case *Elkins v. Moreno*, 435 U.S. 647 (1978), is highly relevant here. While that case dealt with G-4 visa holders and in-state tuition, its core holding established that federal immigration law does not automatically preclude a non-immigrant alien from forming the requisite intent to establish domicile for state law purposes, *unless* federal law expressly prohibits such intent or makes it impossible to fulfill both federal and state requirements simultaneously.
    *   The Court distinguished between an intent to remain indefinitely (for domicile) and an intent to abandon foreign residence or establish *permanent residence* in the immigration sense. A person can intend to remain indefinitely in a state *as long as their visa allows*, without intending to violate their visa terms or establish *permanent residence* in the immigration sense.

3.  **Application to Maria's Case:**
    *   Maria's TD visa requires her to maintain a foreign residence and not intend to establish *permanent residence* (i.e., become a green card holder or citizen).
    *   However, she can still form the intent to reside in Arizona indefinitely *as a TD visa holder*, renewing her visa as long as possible, without necessarily violating the terms of her visa. Her intent to remain indefinitely for state domicile purposes is not automatically negated by her non-immigrant visa status.
    *   The trial court's ruling suggests a blanket preclusion, which *Elkins v. Moreno* generally rejects. Federal immigration law does not preempt a state's ability to define domicile for its own purposes, unless there's a direct and unavoidable conflict.

4.  **The Pending Petition for Alien Relative:**
    *   Ironically, Maria's action of beginning the process of seeking lawful permanent resident status through her sister's petition *strengthens* her argument that she *does* have an intent to remain permanently in the United States. This demonstrates an actual intent to establish a long-term presence, which is consistent with the intent required for domicile, even if it's a separate immigration process. It shows her *actual intent* is to remain, rather than being legally precluded from forming such intent.

**Conclusion:**

The trial court's dismissal was likely incorrect because federal immigration law, specifically Maria's TD visa status, does not automatically preclude her from establishing domicile in Arizona for the purpose of obtaining a divorce. The intent required for state law domicile (""intent to remain indefinitely"") is distinct from the intent prohibited by her non-immigrant visa (""intent to establish permanent residence"" in the immigration sense). The court should have considered whether Maria, as a factual matter, possessed the intent to remain indefinitely in Arizona, rather than ruling that her visa status legally prevented her from doing so.",[],,0.8291908502578735,13.732952344052695,29.401179775280923
"A Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status applicant, whose I-360 petition was revoked by USCIS because it was received on his 21st birthday instead of before, challenges the revocation.

Here's an analysis of the extent to which a U.S. District Court would likely have subject matter jurisdiction over each of the applicant's claims:

**General Principles of Subject Matter Jurisdiction in Immigration:**

1.  **Federal Question Jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1331):** Federal courts generally have jurisdiction over cases ""arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States."" This is the primary basis for reviewing APA and constitutional claims.
2.  **Administrative Procedure Act (APA):** The APA (5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.) provides a cause of action for judicial review of agency actions, unless a statute specifically precludes review or the action is committed to agency discretion by law.
3.  **Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) Jurisdictional Bars:** The INA, particularly § 242, contains several provisions that broadly limit judicial review of immigration decisions. These ""zipper clauses"" often channel review to the Courts of Appeals for final orders of removal or preclude review of certain discretionary decisions. However, these bars are generally interpreted not to preclude review of:
    *   **Pure questions of law:** Challenges to the legality or interpretation of statutes or regulations.
    *   **Constitutional claims:** Colorable claims that an agency action violates constitutional rights.
    *   **Challenges to agency procedures or regulations themselves:** As opposed to the application of discretion in a specific case.

---

**Analysis of Each Claim:**

**1. APA Challenge to Filing Regulations (Unreasonable for not permitting same-day electronic or hand delivery):**

*   **Nature of the Claim:** This is a challenge to the *legality* and *reasonableness* of an agency regulation itself, not a challenge to a discretionary decision made under that regulation. The applicant is arguing that the regulation, as written and applied, is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law under APA § 706(2)(A).
*   **Jurisdictional Bar Impact:** Courts generally retain jurisdiction to review challenges to the validity of agency regulations, even in the immigration context. The INA's jurisdictional bars typically target review of discretionary decisions or final orders of removal, not the underlying rules that govern agency conduct. A challenge to a regulation's reasonableness under the APA is a pure question of law.
*   **Conclusion:** The U.S. District Court would **likely have subject matter jurisdiction** over this claim under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and the APA.

**2. APA Challenge to 16-Month Delay (Unreasonable):**

*   **Nature of the Claim:** This is a claim that the agency has ""unreasonably delayed"" agency action, falling under APA § 706(1). The applicant is not challenging the merits of the decision, but the agency's dilatory conduct.
*   **Jurisdictional Bar Impact:** Claims of unreasonable delay are generally reviewable by federal courts. While the INA bars review of certain discretionary decisions, it does not typically bar review of claims that an agency has failed to act or has acted with unreasonable delay. Courts have a role in ensuring agencies act within a reasonable timeframe.
*   **Conclusion:** The U.S. District Court would **likely have subject matter jurisdiction** over this claim under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and the APA.

**3. Constitutional Rights Challenge (Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses):**

*   **Nature of the Claim:** This is a direct challenge alleging violations of fundamental constitutional rights (Equal Protection and Due Process) due to the inability to file electronically, unlike other applicants.
*   **Jurisdictional Bar Impact:** Federal courts generally retain jurisdiction to review ""colorable"" constitutional claims, even in the face of broad statutory jurisdictional bars in immigration law. The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed this principle (e.g., *INS v. St. Cyr*, *McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc.*). While Congress can limit judicial review, it must do so explicitly and provide an adequate substitute for judicial review, especially for constitutional claims. Challenges to agency procedures that allegedly violate due process or equal protection are typically reviewable.
*   **Conclusion:** The U.S. District Court would **likely have subject matter jurisdiction** over this claim under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.

---

**Overall Summary:**

The U.S. District Court would **likely have subject matter jurisdiction over all three claims**. This is because:

*   The claims involve **pure questions of law** (challenging the legality/reasonableness of regulations and agency delay) and **constitutional claims**, which are generally preserved from the broad jurisdictional bars found in the INA.
*   The revocation of the I-360 petition, in this context, is based on an interpretation of a filing deadline and the agency's own regulations, rather than a purely discretionary decision on the merits of the SIJ classification itself. Challenges to such interpretations and the underlying regulations are typically reviewable.
*   The APA provides a cause of action for reviewing agency actions that are arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law, or for compelling agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.

It's important to note that while jurisdiction is likely, the applicant would still need to demonstrate the merits of their claims to succeed.",[],,0.8298060894012451,13.72566590772291,27.4658514563869

**Claims That May Proceed in District Court:**

1.  **APA Claim: Unreasonable Filing Requirements (Challenge to the validity of the ""before 21st birthday"" regulation):**
    *   **Reasoning:** While 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) generally bars judicial review of discretionary decisions by USCIS, the exception in **8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D)** preserves jurisdiction for ""constitutional claims or questions of law."" A challenge to the *legality* or *reasonableness* of an agency regulation itself (e.g., whether it exceeds statutory authority, is arbitrary and capricious, or is contrary to law) is typically considered a ""question of law."" Therefore, the District Court would likely have jurisdiction to review whether the ""before 21st birthday"" filing requirement, as applied to SIJ applicants, is a valid and reasonable regulation under the APA.

2.  **APA Claim: Unreasonable Delay in Revocation:**
    *   **Reasoning:** Claims of unreasonable delay or agency inaction are generally reviewable under the APA (5 U.S.C. § 706(1)) and/or mandamus jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1361). Courts typically retain jurisdiction to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed, even in the immigration context. This is a procedural challenge to the timing of the agency's action, not a challenge to the merits of a discretionary decision.

3.  **Equal Protection Claim:**
    *   **Reasoning:** **8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D)** explicitly preserves jurisdiction for ""constitutional claims."" An Equal Protection claim, alleging discriminatory treatment, is a constitutional claim and thus would not be barred from review by the District Court.

4.  **Due Process Claim:**
    *   **Reasoning:** Similar to Equal Protection, a Due Process claim (e.g., alleging a lack of fair notice or opportunity to be heard) is a constitutional claim. **8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D)** ensures that such claims are reviewable by the District Court.

**Claims Subject to Jurisdictional Bars:**

*   **None of the specific claims listed are *inherently* subject to jurisdictional bars in this context, assuming they are framed as challenges to the legality of the regulation, constitutional violations, or unreasonable delay.**

**Important Nuance:**

It's crucial to distinguish between challenging the *legality* or *constitutionality* of a regulation or agency action (which is generally reviewable) and challenging the *application* of a discretionary decision *on its merits* (which is often barred). In this scenario, the applicant is challenging the underlying filing requirement itself and the process, not merely asking the court to second-guess USCIS's discretionary decision to deny the petition based on a valid rule. The federal court decisions that have allowed SIJ-related challenges to proceed have focused on the ""questions of law"" and ""constitutional claims"" exceptions to the broad jurisdictional bars.",[],,0.8209177851676941,14.335985735575903,26.850463593783275
"An individual in removal proceedings, who has a U.S. citizen spouse with chronic health conditions like high cholesterol and asthma, files a motion to reopen her case to apply for cancellation of removal, asserting that her removal would cause ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" to her spouse. She also argues that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) applied an incorrect legal standard in evaluating her prima facie eligibility for relief. How should a U.S. Court of Appeals rule on the petition for review?","The U.S. Court of Appeals should deny the petition for review. The court would find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion by determining that the individual failed to establish prima facie eligibility for cancellation of removal, as the spouse's conditions (high cholesterol and asthma) and associated emotional hardship were not shown to be ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" beyond what is normally expected from the deportation of an alien with close family members. Furthermore, the court would conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion by applying an incorrect legal standard, as the record indicates the BIA and the Immigration Judge (IJ) used the ""reasonable likelihood"" standard, citing relevant precedent, despite not explicitly expounding upon it. The individual's claim regarding the rescission of her in absentia removal order would be considered forfeited.",,,,,,,,"The U.S. Court of Appeals should deny the petition for review.

The individual's claim regarding the rescission of her in absentia removal order would be considered forfeited.","A U.S. Court of Appeals' ruling on this petition for review would depend critically on the specific nature of the ""incorrect legal standard"" argument and the deference afforded to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) in evaluating hardship.

Here's a breakdown of how the Court of Appeals would likely approach the case:

1.  **Jurisdiction:**
    *   The Court of Appeals generally has jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, including denials of motions to reopen, but its jurisdiction is limited.
    *   **Questions of Law:** The Court has jurisdiction to review ""questions of law"" *de novo* (meaning, without deference to the BIA's interpretation). The argument that the BIA applied an ""incorrect legal standard"" falls squarely into this category.
    *   **Discretionary Decisions:** The Court generally *lacks* jurisdiction to review purely discretionary decisions, such as the BIA's ultimate decision on whether to grant cancellation of removal or whether the facts presented *actually* meet the ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" standard, *unless* there's a constitutional claim or a question of law involved. However, it *can* review whether the BIA abused its discretion in denying a motion to reopen.

2.  **Review of the ""Incorrect Legal Standard"" Argument:**
    *   This is the petitioner's strongest argument for a favorable ruling. If the petitioner can demonstrate that the BIA misinterpreted the statutory definition of ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" (8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1)(D)) or applied an incorrect burden of proof for *prima facie* eligibility, the Court of Appeals would review this *de novo*.
    *   **Ruling:** If the Court finds that the BIA indeed applied an incorrect legal standard, it would likely **grant the petition for review, vacate the BIA's decision, and remand the case to the BIA** with instructions to apply the correct legal standard. This means the BIA would have to re-evaluate the motion to reopen using the proper legal framework.

3.  **Review of the ""Exceptional and Extremely Unusual Hardship"" Argument (if the legal standard was correctly applied):**
    *   If the Court finds that the BIA applied the *correct* legal standard for ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" and *prima facie* eligibility, then the Court would review the BIA's *application* of that standard to the facts for **abuse of discretion**.
    *   **Abuse of Discretion Standard:** This is a highly deferential standard. The BIA's decision will be upheld unless it was ""arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law,"" or if the BIA acted without a rational explanation, or if it failed to consider all relevant factors. The Court will *not* reweigh the evidence or substitute its own judgment for that of the BIA regarding whether the hardship meets the statutory threshold.
    *   **""Exceptional and Extremely Unusual Hardship"":** This is a very high bar. It requires hardship ""substantially beyond that which would ordinarily be expected to result from an alien's deportation."" While chronic health conditions like high cholesterol and asthma are serious, they are also common. The BIA would consider factors like the severity of the conditions, the availability of care for the spouse in the petitioner's absence, the spouse's dependence on the petitioner, and the overall impact on the spouse's well-being.
    *   **Ruling:** It is very difficult to overturn a BIA's discretionary finding on hardship under an abuse of discretion standard.
        *   If the BIA considered the evidence regarding the spouse's health conditions and reasonably concluded that, even with the petitioner's removal, the hardship did not rise to the ""exceptional and extremely unusual"" level, the Court would likely **deny the petition for review** on this ground.
        *   However, if the BIA completely ignored significant evidence, failed to articulate a rational basis for its decision, or made a decision that was so lacking in foundation as to be arbitrary, the Court *could* find an abuse of discretion and remand the case. This is a rare outcome for the factual determination of hardship itself.

**Conclusion:**

The most likely outcome depends on the strength of the ""incorrect legal standard"" argument:

*   **If the petitioner successfully demonstrates that the BIA applied an incorrect legal standard for *prima facie* eligibility or the definition of ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship,"" the Court of Appeals should **grant the petition for review, vacate the BIA's decision, and remand the case** for reconsideration under the correct legal standard.** This is the most promising path for the petitioner.
*   **If the Court finds that the BIA applied the correct legal standard, but merely disagreed with the BIA's factual conclusion that the hardship did not meet the ""exceptional and extremely unusual"" threshold, the Court of Appeals would likely **deny the petition for review**, as it would defer to the BIA's discretionary judgment under the abuse of discretion standard.**

Therefore, the ruling hinges on whether the BIA's error was one of law (reviewable *de novo*) or a discretionary application of the law to the facts (reviewable for abuse of discretion, which is much harder to overturn).",[],,0.8223636150360107,16.561873528879236,26.511316539923968
"Under what circumstances may a U.S. District Court deny a prevailing party's motion for attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) due to insufficient proof of financial eligibility, even when an affidavit from the party attests to meeting the statutory net worth requirement?","A U.S. District Court may deny in part, without prejudice, a motion for attorney's fees under the EAJA when a prevailing party's affidavit asserting compliance with the $2,000,000 net worth requirement is insufficient, particularly when challenged by defendants citing record evidence that suggests a potentially higher net worth. While an affidavit can be an efficient way to present evidence of net worth, the court must assess the entire record to determine if the financial eligibility burden of proof is met.

The key principle is that the burden of proof for financial eligibility rests squarely with the applicant, and a mere conclusory statement in an affidavit, without more, is often insufficient for the court to make a finding.

Here are the primary circumstances:

1.  **Lack of Specificity and Detail in the Affidavit:** A barebones affidavit that merely states the party meets the net worth requirement (e.g., ""My net worth does not exceed $2 million"") without providing any supporting financial data, itemization of assets and liabilities, or explanation of valuation methods, may be deemed insufficient. Courts require enough detail to independently verify the claim.

2.  **Failure to Provide Supporting Documentation:** Even with an affidavit, courts often require supporting documents to substantiate the claims made. This can include:
    *   Tax returns (personal or business)
    *   Balance sheets
    *   Statements of assets and liabilities
    *   Appraisals for real estate or other significant assets
    *   Bank statements
    *   Documentation of business ownership and structure (for organizations)
    If the applicant fails to provide these documents when requested by the court or the government (respondent), the affidavit alone may not suffice.

3.  **Ambiguity or Inconsistency in the Financial Information:** If the affidavit is vague, internally inconsistent, or contradicts other information already in the record (e.g., financial disclosures made in other contexts during the litigation), the court may find the proof insufficient.

4.  **Failure to Respond to Court Inquiries or Discovery:** If the court or the government (as the respondent) requests additional information or discovery regarding the applicant's financial status, and the applicant fails to adequately respond or provides evasive answers, the court may deny the motion, even if an initial affidavit was filed.

5.  **Complex Financial Structures:** For individuals with complex assets (e.g., multiple business interests, trusts, significant real estate holdings, substantial investments) or for organizations, a simple affidavit is almost never enough. The court needs a clear picture of how all assets and liabilities are valued and aggregated to determine net worth.

6.  **Disputed Valuation Methods:** If the government challenges the applicant's valuation of assets (e.g., arguing that fair market value should be used instead of book value, or disputing the value of a particular asset), and the affidavit does not provide a clear, verifiable basis for the valuation, the court may find the proof inadequate.

In essence, while an affidavit is a necessary component, it functions as sworn testimony. For EAJA purposes, it must be sufficiently detailed and, often, corroborated by other financial records to allow the court to confidently conclude that the applicant meets the statutory net worth limits (currently $2 million for individuals and $7 million for businesses/organizations with no more than 500 employees). Without such verifiable proof, the court is justified in denying the fee motion.",[],,0.8433977961540222,16.93178137651822,19.97900809716603
"An employer seeks an H-1B visa for a ""Vice President of Strategic Planning"" role, requiring a bachelor's degree in Business Administration or a closely related field.

Furthermore, as this was a new position for Vision Builders, it could not demonstrate what it ""normally requires"" for the role.","A court would likely **uphold USCIS's denial** in this scenario. Here's why:

1.  **Definition of ""Specialty Occupation"":** The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) defines a ""specialty occupation"" as one requiring ""theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge"" and requiring ""attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in a specific specialty, or its equivalent, as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States."" (8 CFR § 214.2(h)(4)(ii)).

2.  **""Specific Specialty"" Requirement:** USCIS has consistently interpreted the ""specific specialty"" requirement narrowly. They often argue that broad, generalized degrees like ""Business Administration,"" ""Management,"" or ""Liberal Arts"" do not, by themselves, constitute a ""specific specialty"" unless the job duties are so specialized that only that degree (or a very closely related, specialized field within it) would qualify. The rationale is that a general business degree provides a broad foundation but not the ""highly specialized knowledge"" envisioned by the statute for many roles.

3.  **USCIS's Four Criteria for Specialty Occupation:** To qualify as a specialty occupation, the position must meet at least one of four criteria:
    *   A bachelor's or higher degree in a specific specialty (or its equivalent) is normally the minimum requirement for entry into the particular position.
    *   The degree requirement is common to the industry in parallel positions among similar organizations, or the employer normally requires a degree or its equivalent for the position.
    *   The nature of the specific duties is so specialized and complex that it requires a person with a bachelor's or higher degree in a specific specialty.

4.  **Application to ""Vice President of Strategic Planning"":** While a ""Vice President"" title suggests a high-level role, the title alone is not determinative. USCIS would scrutinize the *actual duties* and the *required degree*.
    *   **Generalized Degree:** USCIS's argument that a ""generalized business administration degree"" does not meet the ""specific specialty"" requirement is a common and often successful one. For a role like ""Strategic Planning,"" USCIS might expect a degree in a more focused field like ""Finance,"" ""Economics,"" ""Marketing Analytics,"" ""Operations Research,"" or ""Business Analytics,"" especially if the strategic planning involves highly technical or quantitative analysis. A general business administration degree, without a specific concentration or a demonstration that its curriculum is uniquely tailored to the specific strategic planning duties, often falls short.
    *   **Employer's Burden:** The burden is on the employer to demonstrate that the position meets the specialty occupation criteria. Simply stating ""Business Administration or closely related field"" might not be specific enough to overcome USCIS's scrutiny. The employer would need to show that the *specific curriculum* of a general business administration degree provides the *highly specialized knowledge* required for *this particular* Vice President of Strategic Planning role, and that this is common in the industry.

5.  **Judicial Review Standard (Deference to Agency):** When a court reviews an agency's decision (like USCIS's), it generally applies a deferential standard. The court will uphold the agency's decision unless it finds it to be ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law."" (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). Given USCIS's consistent interpretation of ""specific specialty"" and the broad nature of a ""Business Administration"" degree, it is highly likely that a court would find USCIS's denial to be a *reasonable* exercise of its discretion and a permissible interpretation of its own regulations. The court would likely conclude that USCIS had a rational basis for its decision.

**Conclusion:**

Based on USCIS's established interpretation of ""specialty occupation"" and the ""specific specialty"" requirement, and the deference courts typically give to agency decisions, a court would most likely **uphold USCIS's denial**. The employer would face a significant challenge in proving that USCIS misinterpreted the regulatory standard or abused its discretion, especially given the generalized nature of the degree requirement presented in the petition.",[],,0.8406686186790466,17.477796849757677,15.693291935918182
"An asylum seeker, Mr. X, claims he fears torture if returned to his home country.

1.  **Actions Under Color of Law:** The perpetrators were uniformed police officers. Even if their actions were illegal under domestic law, they were acting under the ""color of law"" or ""apparent authority"" of their official position. They used their status as police officers to gain entry, make accusations, and inflict harm.
2.  **CAT's Broad Definition:** The CAT defines torture as pain or suffering inflicted ""by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.""
    *   **""By a public official"":** The officers clearly fall into this category.
    *   **""Acquiescence"":** The government's common claim that such officers are ""rogue agents"" does not automatically negate official capacity. If the government is aware of these officers' corrupt activities and personal vendettas (as Mr. X alleges they are ""known for""), and fails to investigate, prosecute, or otherwise control them, this can be interpreted as ""acquiescence"" to their actions. The state's failure to prevent or punish torture committed by its agents can be sufficient for a CAT claim.
3.  **Motive Related to State Function:** The explicit reason given for the beating and robbery – retaliation for reporting a corrupt local official – directly links the officers' actions to a state-related function (anti-corruption efforts) and the abuse of state power. It's not a purely private dispute.

In essence, the CAT does not require the state to officially sanction or authorize the torture. It focuses on whether the perpetrators were state actors (or acting with state involvement/acquiescence) and used their official position to inflict the harm.

However, there is a **critical exception under VAWA** that allows a self-petitioner to overcome this bar.

Here's a breakdown:

1.  **The General Rule (INA 204(c) - Marriage Fraud Bar):**
    *   If a person has been found to have entered into a marriage for the purpose of evading immigration laws, they are generally barred from receiving approval of *any* subsequent visa petition based on *any* marriage. This is a very serious and often permanent bar.
    *   Even though the marriage was annulled (meaning it was legally void from the beginning), the *finding* that it was entered into for the purpose of evading immigration laws still stands. The annulment doesn't erase the government's determination of fraudulent intent.

2.  **The VAWA Exception:**
    *   The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) specifically provides an exception to the marriage fraud bar (INA 204(c)) for self-petitioners.
    *   Under VAWA, a self-petitioner who has been found to have entered into a prior fraudulent marriage can still have their I-360 VAWA petition approved **if they can demonstrate that the subsequent marriage (the one forming the basis of the VAWA petition) was entered into in good faith.**
    *   The purpose of this exception is to ensure that victims of abuse are not penalized for a prior mistake or misjudgment, especially when they are genuinely seeking relief from an abusive relationship.

3.  **Applying it to Your Scenario:**
    *   The petitioner would need to present compelling evidence that the *later marriage* (the one where battery or extreme cruelty occurred) was entered into in **good faith**.
    *   Demonstrating battery or extreme cruelty in the later marriage is crucial for the VAWA petition itself, and it also helps to establish the good faith of that marriage. If the petitioner genuinely believed they were entering into a real marriage, only for it to become abusive, that supports the good faith requirement.
    *   USCIS will scrutinize the evidence to ensure that the petitioner did not enter into the *second* marriage with the primary intent of circumventing immigration laws, but rather with the intent of forming a genuine marital relationship.

**Conclusion:**

While the prior finding of marriage fraud is a serious negative factor, the **VAWA exception to INA 204(c) is specifically designed for situations like this.** The petitioner would have the burden to prove that the *abusive marriage* was entered into in good faith. If they can successfully do so, along with meeting all other VAWA eligibility requirements (including demonstrating battery or extreme cruelty), the prior annulled marriage for immigration fraud **should not be used to deny the subsequent I-360 VAWA self-petition.**",[],,0.8306792378425598,14.877699933906147,35.02003965631198

The court also noted that raw asylum grant statistics do not support a finding of due process denial.","Yes, an asylum applicant *can* attempt to challenge these aspects of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision, but the likelihood of success on judicial review is generally low due to the broad discretion afforded to the BIA and the high bar for proving legal error or due process violations.

Let's break down each point:

1.  **Challenging the BIA's decision not to refer their case to a three-member panel:**
    *   **Legal Basis:** The BIA has internal operating procedures, codified in 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e), that govern how cases are assigned for review (single member, two-member, or three-member panel). The vast majority of cases are initially reviewed by a single BIA member. A three-member panel is typically reserved for cases involving novel legal issues, circuit splits, or the need to establish precedent.
    *   **Likelihood of Success:** Courts generally treat the BIA's decision on panel composition as an internal administrative matter largely within the BIA's discretion. Challenges to the BIA's internal operating procedures are rarely successful unless the applicant can demonstrate a clear abuse of discretion or a violation of a specific statutory or regulatory mandate that prejudiced their case. Simply arguing that a three-member panel *should* have heard the case is usually insufficient. Courts typically defer to the agency's judgment on how to manage its caseload.

2.  **Arguing that the BIA was biased for not requiring the government to file a brief:**
    *   **Legal Basis:** There is no general requirement that the government (DHS/ICE) file a brief in every appeal before the BIA. The BIA has discretion to decide whether additional briefing is necessary. The burden of proof in asylum cases rests with the applicant, and it is the applicant's responsibility to present their case and arguments on appeal.
    *   **Likelihood of Success:** An argument of bias based solely on the absence of a government brief would be very difficult to win. To succeed, the applicant would likely need to show:
        *   **Actual Prejudice:** That the lack of a government brief somehow prevented the applicant from fully presenting their case or responding to an argument they were unaware of, or that it led to a fundamentally unfair process.
        *   **Specific Evidence of Bias:** More than just the absence of a brief; there would need to be evidence of actual prejudice or a pattern of unfairness.
    *   The BIA's role is to review the Immigration Judge's (IJ) decision and the arguments presented by the appealing party (usually the applicant). If the government chooses not to file a brief, it generally means they are relying on the IJ's decision and the record as it stands. This is not inherently biased.

3.  **Claiming a due process violation because a single BIA member rendered a decision that effectively precludes reversal of an immigration judge's order without an intervening change in law:**
    *   **Legal Basis:** This argument often relates to ""Affirmance Without Opinion"" (AWO) decisions, where a single BIA member can affirm an IJ's decision without issuing a separate opinion, effectively adopting the IJ's reasoning. The argument is that this process makes it harder to challenge the IJ's decision on judicial review because there's no separate BIA analysis to scrutinize.
    *   **Likelihood of Success:** This specific due process argument has been extensively litigated and, for the most part, rejected by federal circuit courts and the Supreme Court.
        *   **Supreme Court Precedent:** In *INS v. Chen*, the Supreme Court upheld the BIA's AWO procedure, finding that it does not violate due process as long as the IJ's decision provides a sufficient basis for judicial review.
        *   **Rationale:** Courts have reasoned that due process requires a *meaningful opportunity to be heard* and a *reasoned decision*. When the BIA issues an AWO, it is effectively adopting the IJ's decision as its own. Therefore, the IJ's decision is the ""reasoned decision"" that is subject to judicial review. The federal courts of appeals review the IJ's decision directly to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence and free from legal error.
        *   **""Precludes Reversal"" Argument:** While an AWO means the BIA hasn't added new reasoning, it does not ""preclude reversal"" by a federal court. A federal court can still reverse or remand an IJ's decision (adopted by the BIA via AWO) if it finds that the IJ's decision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, or if it is not supported by substantial evidence. The standard of review remains the same.
    *   **Conclusion:** While an applicant can certainly *make* this due process argument, it has generally not been successful in federal courts. The courts have consistently held that the AWO process, when the IJ's decision is adequate for review, does not violate due process.

In summary, while an asylum applicant has the right to raise these challenges in federal court, the legal landscape heavily favors the BIA's discretion and internal procedures. Success would require demonstrating a clear legal error, a fundamental unfairness, or actual prejudice that rises to the level of a due process violation, which is a high bar to meet.",[],,0.8386342525482178,13.984675324675326,36.78272727272727
"A lawful permanent resident seeking naturalization was convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, causing a loss of over $10,000. The sentencing for this offense was less than one year of imprisonment. Can this conviction be deemed an ""aggravated felony"" under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), thus precluding naturalization due to a lack of good moral character, even if the offense might also be classified as a ""theft offense"" under § 1101(a)(43)(G) which requires a minimum one-year imprisonment term?","Yes, the conviction can be deemed an aggravated felony.

Each subparagraph of § 1101(a)(43) lays out a separate aggravated felony, and there is no indication in the statute that an offense must satisfy multiple subparagraphs. Therefore, a conviction for conspiracy to commit wire fraud with a stipulated loss exceeding $10,000 qualifies as an aggravated felony under § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), precluding a finding of good moral character for naturalization.",,,,,,,,"Yes, the conviction can be deemed an aggravated felony.

Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Aggravated Felony Definition is Disjunctive:** The various subsections of 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43) define different types of aggravated felonies. If a conviction meets the criteria of *any one* of these subsections, it is considered an aggravated felony. The fact that it might *not* meet the criteria of another subsection is irrelevant if it clearly meets one.

2.  **Analysis under § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i):**
    *   This subsection defines an aggravated felony as ""an offense that—(i) involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.""
    *   **""Involves fraud or deceit"":** Conspiracy to commit wire fraud unequivocally involves fraud and deceit.
    *   **""Loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000"":** The question states the loss was ""over $10,000.""
    *   **Sentence Requirement:** Crucially, § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) *does not have a minimum sentence requirement*. It only requires the monetary loss threshold.
    *   **Conclusion for (M)(i):** Since the offense involved fraud/deceit and the loss exceeded $10,000, it perfectly fits the definition of an aggravated felony under this subsection, regardless of the sentence length.

3.  **Analysis under § 1101(a)(43)(G) (Theft Offense):**
    *   This subsection defines an aggravated felony as ""a theft offense (including receipt of stolen property) or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment imposed is at least 1 year.""
    *   While wire fraud *can* sometimes be considered a ""theft offense"" in certain contexts (as it deprives someone of property through deception), the key here is the sentence requirement.
    *   **""Term of imprisonment imposed is at least 1 year"":** The question states the sentencing was ""less than one year of imprisonment.""
    *   **Conclusion for (G):** Even if it were classified as a ""theft offense,"" it would *not* qualify as an aggravated felony under this subsection because it fails to meet the minimum one-year imprisonment term.

4.  **Impact on Naturalization:**
    *   An individual convicted of an aggravated felony is statutorily barred from establishing good moral character for naturalization purposes. 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f)(8) states that ""No person shall be regarded as, or found to be, a person of good moral character who, during the period for which good moral character is required to be established, is, or was—... (8) an aggravated felon (as defined in subsection (a)(43) of this section) who committed the aggravated felony on or after November 29, 1990.""
    *   Since the conviction for conspiracy to commit wire fraud meets the definition of an aggravated felony under § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), the lawful permanent resident would be deemed to lack good moral character and would be precluded from naturalization.

In summary, the conviction for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, with a loss exceeding $10,000, is an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) because that subsection has no minimum sentence requirement. The fact that it does not meet the criteria for a ""theft offense"" aggravated felony under § 1101(a)(43)(G) (due to the short sentence) is irrelevant, as meeting any one aggravated felony definition is sufficient.",[],,0.8581368923187256,13.249035132382897,36.51215419212494
"A rancher whose property is near the U.S. southern border experienced significant damage, including lost cattle profits, depleted water, and trash, directly linked to a dramatic increase in illegal immigration following the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) decisions to halt border wall construction and terminate the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) without conducting environmental analyses. Does this rancher have legal standing to challenge DHS's actions, and would DHS be found in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)?","Yes, the rancher (Steven Smith) has standing to sue, and DHS would be found in violation of NEPA.
The Court found that Smith suffered concrete and particularized injuries, including lost profits from cattle that ingested trash, depleted water reserves due to migrants tying down float systems in water troughs, and trespass with detritus left behind by migrants.

2.  **Responsive Migrants:** Migrants reacted predictably to these relaxed policies, leading to a sharp uptick in illegal immigration, which overwhelmed Border Patrol resources nationwide and diverted manpower away from areas like the Tucson Sector, where Smith lives, thus increasing unpatrolled areas.
3.  **Related Harms:** This dramatic increase in illegal immigration directly led to the increased migrant traffic on Smith’s land, causing the damage to his property, water, and cattle.
The Court concluded that both the cessation of border wall construction and the rescission of MPP constituted ""major Federal actions"" under NEPA, requiring environmental analysis. DHS concededly failed to perform this analysis, thus acting ""without observance of procedure required by law"" in violation of NEPA.",,,,,,,,"Yes, the rancher (Steven Smith) has standing to sue, and DHS would be found in violation of NEPA.

Here's a breakdown:

### 1. Legal Standing

To have legal standing under Article III of the U.S. Constitution, a plaintiff must demonstrate three elements:

*   **Injury-in-Fact:** The plaintiff must have suffered a concrete and particularized injury that is actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.
    *   **Application:** The rancher clearly meets this. Lost cattle profits represent a concrete economic injury. Depleted water and trash on the property are concrete environmental and property injuries. These are particularized to the rancher's specific property and business.
*   **Causation:** The injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court.
    *   **Application:** This is often the trickiest part in cases involving indirect effects. However, the question explicitly states the damage is ""directly linked to a dramatic increase in illegal immigration following the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) decisions."" By halting border wall construction and terminating MPP, DHS made policy decisions that directly impact border management and, as alleged, led to increased immigration flows. The increased human traffic, waste, and resource consumption by migrants are then directly linked to the rancher's specific damages. For NEPA purposes, the injury is also the *procedural* harm of not having the environmental impacts considered.
*   **Redressability:** It must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that a favorable court decision will redress the injury.
    *   **Application:** If a court finds DHS violated NEPA, it could order DHS to conduct the required environmental analyses (EA or EIS) and potentially reconsider its decisions based on those findings. While this wouldn't guarantee an end to all illegal immigration or all damage, it could lead to policy adjustments, mitigation measures, or a reinstatement of previous policies that might alleviate the rancher's injuries. This is generally considered sufficient for redressability in NEPA cases.

**Conclusion on Standing:** Given the explicit statement of direct linkage between DHS's actions, increased immigration, and the rancher's specific, concrete damages, the rancher would very likely have legal standing.

### 2. NEPA Violation

NEPA requires federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of ""major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment"" before taking those actions. This typically involves preparing an Environmental Assessment (EA) to determine if an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is necessary.

*   **""Major Federal Action"":**
    *   **Halting border wall construction:** This is a significant change in a federal infrastructure project. The construction itself was a major federal action, and its cessation, especially if it alters environmental conditions or impacts, would also likely qualify as a major federal action requiring NEPA review.
    *   **Terminating the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP):** This is a significant policy change with widespread implications for how the U.S. manages its border and processes asylum seekers. While policy changes can sometimes be debated under NEPA, if the policy change directly leads to physical environmental impacts (like increased human presence in sensitive areas, resource depletion, and waste), it is more likely to be considered a ""major federal action"" for NEPA purposes.
*   **""Significantly Affecting the Quality of the Human Environment"":**
    *   The rancher's described damages—depleted water, trash, and lost cattle profits (which are an economic impact stemming from environmental degradation)—clearly indicate a significant effect on the human environment, encompassing both the natural environment and the human relationship with it. The ""dramatic increase in illegal immigration"" itself, if directly attributable to DHS's actions, would represent a significant change in human activity in the affected area, with clear environmental consequences.
*   **Failure to Conduct Environmental Analyses:** The question explicitly states that DHS made these decisions ""without conducting environmental analyses."" This is the core procedural violation of NEPA. Agencies are required to *consider* environmental impacts *before* making such decisions, not after.

**Conclusion on NEPA Violation:** Both halting border wall construction and terminating MPP appear to be ""major federal actions"" with potentially ""significant environmental effects."" The failure to conduct any environmental analyses (EA or EIS) prior to implementing these decisions, especially given the alleged direct environmental and economic consequences, would very likely constitute a violation of NEPA.",[],,0.8498132824897766,16.255484892466026,15.706310419140635
"An individual applies for an EB-5 visa, having invested capital in a new commercial enterprise. Their investment agreement includes a ""call option,"" which grants the company the choice to buy out the investor's interest at a specified price after certain conditions are met, but does not give the investor any right to demand repayment. USCIS denies the EB-5 petition, asserting that the call option means the investor's capital is not ""at risk"" and thus constitutes a prohibited debt arrangement. Is USCIS's denial likely to be upheld as consistent with federal law and prior agency decisions?","No, USCIS's denial based solely on the presence of a call option that does not grant the investor a right to demand repayment is unlikely to be upheld. The court found that USCIS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it declared investors ineligible for visas due to call options, concluding that such options do not provide investors with any right to repayment and therefore still place their capital at risk. The court distinguished a call option (a right held by the company) from a sell option (a right held by the investor, which *does* make capital not at risk), finding that USCIS's interpretation stretched the rationale of *Matter of Izummi* and conflicted with the plain language of the regulations. Therefore, the denial, which lacks a rational connection between the facts and the choice made, would likely be set aside.",,,,,,,,"No, USCIS's denial based solely on the presence of a call option that does not grant the investor a right to demand repayment is unlikely to be upheld.

Therefore, the denial, which lacks a rational connection between the facts and the choice made, would likely be set aside.","No, USCIS's denial is **likely not to be upheld** as consistent with federal law and prior agency decisions.

Here's why:

1.  **The ""At Risk"" Requirement:**
    The fundamental principle of the EB-5 program is that the investor's capital must be ""at risk."" This means the capital must be subject to potential loss and must be invested in a way that demonstrates a commitment to the success of the new commercial enterprise. USCIS regulations and precedent (most notably *Matter of Izummi*) emphasize that the investor cannot have a guaranteed return of capital or a guaranteed repayment of the investment. The investor must bear the risk of loss and the opportunity for gain.

2.  **Distinction Between a Call Option and a Debt Arrangement/Redemption Right:**

    *   **Call Option (Company's Right):** In the scenario described, the ""call option"" grants the *company* the choice to buy out the investor's interest. This means the investor's capital remains invested and subject to the fortunes of the enterprise until the company *chooses* to exercise that option. The investor cannot force the company to buy them out.
    *   **Prohibited Debt Arrangement/Redemption Right (Investor's Right):** A prohibited debt arrangement or a redemption right, in the context of EB-5, typically involves the *investor* having the right to demand repayment of their capital, either at a specific time or upon certain conditions. This effectively guarantees the return of capital, removing the ""at risk"" element.

3.  **Why the Call Option is Consistent with ""At Risk"":**

    *   **Investor Bears Risk:** Until the company exercises the call option, the investor's capital is fully exposed to the business risks of the new commercial enterprise. If the enterprise fails before the option is exercised, the investor loses their capital. The investor cannot compel repayment.
    *   **No Guaranteed Return/Repayment:** The call option does not provide the investor with a guaranteed return or a guaranteed repayment. The decision to buy out rests solely with the company. The investor's capital is not a loan that must be repaid.
    *   **Bona Fide Exit Strategy:** A company-initiated call option can be a legitimate and common form of exit strategy for equity investors. USCIS generally permits various exit strategies (e.g., sale to a third party, company buyback) as long as they do not undermine the ""at risk"" nature of the initial investment. The key is that the investor does not have the right to demand repayment.

4.  **USCIS's Misinterpretation:**
    USCIS's assertion that the call option means the capital is not ""at risk"" and constitutes a prohibited debt arrangement appears to conflate a company's *option* to buy back equity with an investor's *right* to demand repayment of a debt. These are distinct legal concepts. The presence of a call option, where the company holds the option and the investor does not have a right to demand repayment, does not transform an equity investment into a debt instrument or remove the ""at risk"" nature of the capital.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the established ""at risk"" requirements under federal law and prior agency decisions (particularly *Matter of Izummi*), an investment agreement containing a call option that grants the *company* the choice to buy out the investor's interest, without giving the *investor* any right to demand repayment, should not be deemed a prohibited debt arrangement. The investor's capital remains ""at risk"" because they cannot compel repayment and are subject to the success or failure of the enterprise until the company chooses to exercise its option. Therefore, USCIS's denial in this scenario is likely inconsistent with federal law and prior agency decisions and would likely be overturned if challenged.",[],,0.8341167569160461,13.253089802130898,38.569282090309514
"A U-visa applicant, whose application has been pending for over four years, files a lawsuit against USCIS alleging unreasonable delay in determining their eligibility for the U-visa waitlist and failure to issue interim employment authorization documents (EAD). The applicant cites a 2011 regulation mandating EAD adjudication within 90 days or the issuance of interim documents. The government moves to dismiss all claims, arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction under IIRIRA provisions (8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(g), 1252(a)(5), and 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)) and failure to state a claim, further contending that the 2011 EAD regulation was repealed in 2017 and therefore does not apply. How should the court rule on these claims?","The court should rule as follows:
1.  **Jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(g) and 1252(a)(5):** The court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint. These IIRIRA provisions do not apply because the plaintiff is not challenging the commencement, adjudication, or execution of a removal order, nor seeking review of a removal order. Instead, the claims challenge the government's delay in adjudicating U-visa waitlist eligibility and work authorization.
2.  **Unreasonable Delay in U-Visa Waitlist Eligibility (APA & Mandamus):**
    *   **Jurisdiction:** The court has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). Determining eligibility for the U-visa waitlist is a mandatory assessment, not a discretionary decision specified by statute, as 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(2) requires eligible petitioners to be placed on the waitlist.
    *   **Merits (Failure to State a Claim):** The plaintiff fails to state a claim for unreasonable delay. While the four-year delay is substantial and several ""TRAC test"" factors favor the plaintiff (e.g., sense of Congress for 180-day processing, human welfare interests, prejudice by delay), the D.C. Circuit precedent places significant weight on the ""competing priorities"" factor. A judicial order expediting this single application would merely shift the plaintiff ahead of thousands of other equally worthy applicants, creating more unfairness than it would remedy, and would interfere with the agency's resource allocation, which is a matter for the political branches.
3.  **Failure to Adjudicate EAD under 8 U.S.C. § 1184(p)(6) (APA & Mandamus):** The court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this claim. The statute explicitly states that ""The Secretary may grant work authorization,"" indicating a purely discretionary decision. Therefore, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) strips the court of jurisdiction to review the Secretary's handling of such discretionary EAD requests, and there is no clear duty to act required for APA or mandamus relief.
4.  **Failure to Issue Interim Work Authorization under 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) (2011) (APA & Mandamus):**
    *   **Applicable Regulation:** The 2011 version of 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) applies. It was in effect when the plaintiff filed their application in June 2016 and when the 90-day adjudication period expired in September 2016. Applying the later-effective 2017 repeal retroactively would strip the plaintiff of a vested right to interim work authorization, which is impermissible without express congressional authorization.
    *   **Jurisdiction:** The court has jurisdiction. The 2011 regulation's language (""USCIS will adjudicate... within 90 days... Failure to complete the adjudication within 90 days will result in the grant..."") creates a clear, mandatory duty for the agency to either adjudicate or issue interim EAD, making it a discrete agency action required to be taken under the APA. Judicial review is not precluded by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as that section applies only to statutory, not regulatory, discretion.
    *   **Merits (Stated a Claim):** The plaintiff has stated a claim for agency action unlawfully withheld. The plain language of the 2011 regulation requires adjudication or issuance of interim EAD within 90 days of receipt, which the agency failed to do. The agency's interpretation that the 90-day clock begins only after a threshold determination on an underlying benefit has no support in the regulation's text and is contradicted by the agency's own reasons for repealing the rule.
5.  **Challenge to Repeal of 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) (2011) without Notice-and-Comment:** This claim is dismissed. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendants' arguments in opposition, thereby conceding the issue.

**I. Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction (IIRIRA Provisions)**

The government's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(g), 1252(a)(5), and 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) should likely be **DENIED** for the unreasonable delay claim, but potentially **GRANTED** for the specific interim EAD claim if it's solely based on a repealed regulation.

*   **8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) (Exclusive Jurisdiction for Specific Actions):** This provision is narrowly construed. In *Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (AADC)*, the Supreme Court held that § 1252(g) applies only to three specific actions: ""decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders."" An unreasonable delay in adjudicating a U-visa application or making a bona fide determination, or a failure to issue an interim EAD, does not fall within these narrow categories. Courts generally retain jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to review agency inaction or unreasonable delay. Therefore, § 1252(g) would not bar jurisdiction here.

*   **8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5) (Exclusive Jurisdiction for Judicial Review of Removal Orders):** This provision grants exclusive jurisdiction to the courts of appeals for judicial review of ""all questions of law and fact... arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States."" The applicant is not challenging a removal order or any action related to removal proceedings. This provision is clearly inapplicable.

*   **8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (No Judicial Review of Discretionary Decisions):** This provision bars judicial review of ""any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security.""
    *   While the *ultimate grant* of a U-visa is discretionary, the applicant is challenging the *unreasonable delay* in determining eligibility for the waitlist (which involves a bona fide determination) and the *failure to act* on an EAD. Courts generally distinguish between challenging the substance of a discretionary decision and challenging an agency's *failure to act* or *unreasonable delay* in acting, which is reviewable under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) (""the reviewing court shall compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed""). The duty to act within a reasonable time is generally considered a non-discretionary duty.
    *   Therefore, this provision would likely *not* bar jurisdiction over the unreasonable delay claim.

**II. Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim**

The government's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim should likely be **DENIED** for the unreasonable delay claim and **GRANTED** for the specific interim EAD claim based on the repealed regulation.

*   **Claim 1: Unreasonable Delay in Determining U-Visa Waitlist Eligibility**
    *   **Ruling:** The motion to dismiss this claim should be **DENIED**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The applicant alleges a delay of over four years in determining eligibility for the U-visa waitlist. This length of time, on its face, is prima facie unreasonable. Courts apply the *TRAC* factors (Telecommunications Research and Action Center v. FCC) to assess unreasonable delay: (1) the time agencies take to make decisions, (2) Congress's intent in establishing deadlines, (3) the extent to which delay causes injury, (4) the agency's resources, (5) the public interest, and (6) the agency's explanation for the delay.
    *   A four-year delay for a U-visa application, which often involves vulnerable individuals seeking humanitarian relief and protection, strongly suggests unreasonable delay and potential injury. The applicant has stated a plausible claim under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), that USCIS has unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed agency action.

*   **Claim 2: Failure to Issue Interim Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) based on 2011 Regulation**
    *   **Ruling:** The motion to dismiss this specific claim should be **GRANTED**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The government correctly argues that the 2011 regulation mandating EAD adjudication within 90 days or the issuance of interim documents (likely referring to 8 CFR § 274a.13(d)) was indeed repealed or significantly modified in 2017, removing the interim EAD requirement for initial EAD applications. If the regulation the applicant relies upon is no longer in effect or applicable to their situation, then the applicant cannot base a claim for relief on it.
    *   While the *need* for an EAD due to the delay is a compelling aspect of the applicant's overall situation, the specific legal basis for compelling an interim EAD *under that particular repealed regulation* is no longer valid. The court cannot order an agency to comply with a regulation that has been lawfully repealed.
    *   *However, it's important to note:* If the court finds unreasonable delay in the *bona fide determination* (Claim 1), and that determination is eventually made, the applicant *could then* become eligible for an EAD under current U-visa regulations (8 CFR § 214.14(c)(5)(ii)), which allows for employment authorization after a bona fide determination. The failure of this specific EAD claim does not undermine the unreasonable delay claim regarding the waitlist determination itself.

**Conclusion:**

The court should **DENY** the government's motion to dismiss the claim for **unreasonable delay** in determining U-visa waitlist eligibility, as it likely has subject matter jurisdiction under the APA and the applicant has stated a plausible claim.

The court should **GRANT** the government's motion to dismiss the specific claim for **failure to issue interim EADs** based on the 2011 regulation, as that regulation has been repealed.",[],,0.856991708278656,14.977096774193548,27.325388751033927
"A group of nonimmigrant visa applicants filed a lawsuit against U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleging unreasonable delays in the adjudication of their applications for extension of status and/or work authorization due to a new biometrics policy. Some plaintiffs' applications are adjudicated during the pendency of the lawsuit, while others remain pending at a USCIS service center located in the Northern District of Texas. What procedural actions will the D.C. District Court likely take regarding the claims of the plaintiffs?","The D.C. District Court will dismiss as moot the claims of those plaintiffs whose applications have been adjudicated since the suit was filed, due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction. For the remaining plaintiffs whose applications are still awaiting adjudication, the court will transfer their claims to the Northern District of Texas, where the relevant USCIS service center is located. This transfer is deemed appropriate because the transferee district is where the decision-making process for their applications occurs, and factors such as convenience of parties and witnesses, the interest of justice, and the location of evidence weigh in favor of transfer.",,,,,,,,"The D.C.

This transfer is deemed appropriate because the transferee district is where the decision-making process for their applications occurs, and factors such as convenience of parties and witnesses, the interest of justice, and the location of evidence weigh in favor of transfer.","The D.C. District Court will likely take the following procedural actions regarding the claims of the plaintiffs:

1.  **Dismissal of Claims for Adjudicated Plaintiffs (Mootness):**
    *   For the plaintiffs whose applications have been adjudicated during the pendency of the lawsuit, their claims for unreasonable delay in adjudication will likely be dismissed as **moot**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The primary relief sought in an unreasonable delay case under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) or mandamus is an order compelling the agency to act (i.e., adjudicate the application). Once the application is adjudicated, that specific relief has been granted, and there is no longer a live controversy for the court to resolve regarding *that specific application's delay*. While they might have suffered harm from the delay, the APA generally does not provide for monetary damages for unreasonable delay, and the specific injunctive relief sought is no longer necessary.

2.  **Retention of Jurisdiction and Proceeding on the Merits for Remaining Plaintiffs:**
    *   For the plaintiffs whose applications remain pending at the USCIS service center in the Northern District of Texas, the D.C. District Court will likely **retain jurisdiction and venue** and proceed to address the merits of their claims.
    *   **Venue Argument:** While the physical processing of the applications occurs in Texas, the lawsuit alleges that the *cause* of the unreasonable delays is a ""new biometrics policy."" Policy decisions for USCIS are made at its headquarters, which are located in Washington, D.C. Federal courts, particularly the D.C. District Court, often find venue proper in D.C. for challenges to agency-wide policies or actions, even if the individual impact is felt elsewhere, because a ""substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim"" (i.e., the policy formulation and implementation) occurred in D.C.
    *   **Merits Review (APA/Mandamus):** The court will then evaluate whether USCIS's delay in adjudicating these applications is ""unreasonable"" under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 706(1)) or whether USCIS has failed to perform a clear, non-discretionary duty (mandamus). This typically involves:
        *   **Ordering USCIS to file status reports:** The court will likely require USCIS to provide detailed updates on the status of the remaining plaintiffs' applications and explain the reasons for the continued delays, particularly in light of the new biometrics policy.
        *   **Setting a briefing schedule:** The court will likely set a schedule for the parties to file motions (e.g., cross-motions for summary judgment) addressing whether the delays are indeed unreasonable and whether the court should compel adjudication.
        *   **Potential for Injunctive Relief:** If the court finds the delays to be unreasonable, it could issue an order compelling USCIS to adjudicate the remaining applications within a specific, reasonable timeframe.

3.  **Consideration of Transfer (Less Likely Given Policy Challenge):**
    *   While less likely given the challenge to a *policy* originating in D.C., the court *could* theoretically consider transferring the claims of the remaining plaintiffs to the Northern District of Texas under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) for the ""convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice."" This would be more probable if the claims were purely about individual service center backlogs rather than a systemic policy issue. However, because the lawsuit specifically targets a ""new biometrics policy"" as the root cause, the D.C. District Court is generally considered an appropriate forum for such agency-wide policy challenges.

In summary, the D.C. District Court will likely dismiss the claims of those whose applications have been adjudicated due to mootness, and proceed to hear the merits of the claims of the remaining plaintiffs, focusing on whether the alleged biometrics policy has caused unreasonable delays in violation of the APA.",[],,0.8315377831459045,13.858727106227107,32.91490384615389
"An immigration advocacy group, similar to the American Immigration Council, seeks records from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding a program where CBP agents conducted credible fear interviews. The group specifically requested records related to training materials, supervision protocols, and grant/denial rates, but CBP only searched for a limited set of categories. USCIS and DHS withheld several documents, including drafts, issue papers, briefing memos, and an email containing names of CBP officers, citing deliberative process and personal privacy exemptions. The group challenges the adequacy of CBP's search and the agencies' withholdings. How would a federal court likely rule on these challenges based on the provided case precedent?","Based on the provided case precedent, a federal court would likely rule as follows:
1.  **CBP's Search:** The court would find CBP's search insufficient. CBP only searched for two out of seven requested categories, relying on the assertion that DHS and USCIS were the ""likely custodians"" for the others. The court found this justification inadequate, as CBP's role was not sufficiently limited to excuse it from searching other relevant categories, nor was the search description for the categories it *did* search adequately detailed. CBP would be ordered to conduct a more comprehensive search.
2.  **Exemption 5 (Deliberative Process) Withholdings by DHS and USCIS:** The court would likely find that DHS and USCIS did not adequately justify these withholdings. The agencies' descriptions of the documents (drafts, issue papers, briefing memos, meeting topics) and their role in a deliberative process were deemed too broad and conclusory, lacking specific detail on the decision or policy involved, the nature of the deliberation, or the specific foreseeable harm disclosure would cause. The agencies would be given an opportunity to supplement their Vaughn indices with more detailed justifications or release the documents, and in camera inspection would likely be ordered given the small number of documents.
3.  **Exemptions 6 and 7(C) (Personal Privacy) Withholdings by USCIS for CBP Officer Names:** The court would find these withholdings improper. While the document (an email concerning job duties) was considered a ""similar file"" under Exemption 6, the privacy interest in the CBP officers' names was deemed de minimis, especially compared to unredacted USCIS asylum officers' names in the same document. Even if a substantial privacy interest existed, the public interest in understanding government operations, particularly given that CBP officers were instructed not to disclose their identity during interviews, would significantly outweigh it.

**1. Challenge to CBP's Search Adequacy:**

*   **Likely Ruling:** The court would likely find CBP's search **inadequate** and order a more thorough search.
*   **Reasoning:** Agencies are required to conduct a search ""reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents."" The advocacy group specifically requested records related to ""training materials, supervision protocols, and grant/denial rates."" If CBP only searched for ""a limited set of categories"" that did not encompass all these explicit requests, it has failed to demonstrate a reasonable search. The burden is on the agency to show that its search was adequate, typically through detailed affidavits explaining the search terms used, the databases searched, and the personnel involved. A limited search that clearly misses requested categories would not meet this standard.

**2. Challenge to USCIS and DHS Withholdings (Exemption 5 - Deliberative Process):**

*   **Documents:** Drafts, issue papers, briefing memos.
*   **Likely Ruling:** The court would likely **uphold** the withholding of these documents under Exemption 5, *provided* the agencies can adequately demonstrate they are both **predecisional** and **deliberative**.
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   **Predecisional:** These documents must have been generated before the adoption of an agency policy or decision. Drafts, issue papers, and briefing memos are classic examples of predecisional documents, reflecting evolving thoughts and recommendations before a final decision is made.
    *   **Deliberative:** They must be part of the ""give-and-take"" of the decision-making process, containing opinions, recommendations, or policy discussions, rather than purely factual information.
    *   **Segregability:** The court would, however, require the agencies to demonstrate that any purely factual information contained within these documents cannot be reasonably segregated and released. If the agencies withheld entire documents without considering segregability, the court might order a review for segregable factual content. The agencies would need to provide a detailed *Vaughn* index or affidavits explaining the deliberative nature of the withheld content and the impracticality of segregating factual material.

**3. Challenge to USCIS and DHS Withholdings (Exemption 6 - Personal Privacy):**

*   **Document:** Email containing names of CBP officers.
*   **Likely Ruling:** The court would likely **uphold** the withholding of the CBP officers' names.
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   **""Similar files"":** An email containing names of government employees falls under the broad interpretation of ""personnel and medical files and similar files.""
    *   **Privacy Interest:** Individual government employees, including law enforcement officers, have a privacy interest in their names not being publicly disclosed, especially when performing routine duties, as such disclosure could lead to harassment, unwanted attention, or threats.
    *   **Public Interest:** To overcome this privacy interest, the advocacy group would need to demonstrate a significant public interest in the *specific identities* of these officers that outweighs their privacy interest. The public interest under FOIA is generally in ""what the government is up to,"" not in the identities of individual employees unless their specific identity sheds light on government misconduct or the agency's performance that cannot be gleaned otherwise. In this scenario, the group's interest is in the program's training, supervision, and rates, which can be assessed without knowing individual officers' names. Without specific allegations of misconduct against the named officers, the public interest in their identities is generally considered minimal and would not outweigh their privacy interest.

**In Summary:**

The court would likely side with the advocacy group regarding the **adequacy of CBP's search**, ordering a more comprehensive effort. However, it would likely side with USCIS and DHS regarding the **withholding of deliberative process documents** (drafts, issue papers, briefing memos) and the **names of CBP officers**, provided the agencies can adequately justify their claims under Exemption 5 (including segregability) and Exemption 6, respectively.",[],,0.8511747717857361,16.850242978003383,16.360196954314745

However, certain types of claims, particularly those involving questions of law or constitutional issues, remain reviewable.

Here's a breakdown of the circumstances for jurisdiction and typical resolution for each claim:

---

### I. Jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals

The general rule is that Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal. However, 8 U.S.C. § 1252 contains several limitations and exceptions:

*   **General Bar on Discretionary Decisions and Factual Findings:**
    *   **8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i):** Generally bars review of ""any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section... 1229b [cancellation of removal]... or 1229c [voluntary departure]."" These are discretionary forms of relief.
    *   **8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii):** Also bars review of ""any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, other than the granting of relief under section 1158(a) of this title.""
    *   **8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C):** Bars review for aliens removable for certain criminal offenses (not directly applicable here unless the GMC finding is based on such a crime).

*   **The Crucial Exception: Constitutional Claims and Questions of Law:**
    *   **8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D):** This provision explicitly states that nothing in the above bars (subparagraphs (B) or (C)) shall be construed as precluding review of ""constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals."" This is the gateway for the alien's claims.

---

#### A. Jurisdiction over the BIA's Finding of Lack of Good Moral Character (GMC)

1.  **Circumstances for Jurisdiction:**
    *   **Questions of Law:** A Court of Appeals *will* have jurisdiction if the alien is challenging the BIA's *legal interpretation* of what constitutes good moral character under 8 U.S.C. § 101(f) or other relevant statutes. For example, if the alien argues the BIA applied an incorrect legal standard, misinterpreted a statutory definition, or failed to consider a legally relevant factor.
    *   **Constitutional Claims:** Jurisdiction may exist if the alien asserts a due process violation related to the GMC finding (e.g., lack of notice, inability to present evidence, or a finding utterly devoid of evidentiary support amounting to arbitrary action).
    *   **Not Reviewable (Generally):** The Court of Appeals generally *lacks* jurisdiction to review the BIA's *factual findings* regarding GMC, as long as those findings are supported by ""substantial evidence."" For instance, if the BIA found the alien lied under oath, and there's evidence to support that finding, the court cannot re-weigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for the BIA's. Similarly, the ultimate discretionary decision to grant or deny cancellation or voluntary departure, even if GMC *was* found, is generally unreviewable.

#### B. Jurisdiction over the Ultra Vires Claim (Expired Temporary BIA Members)

1.  **Circumstances for Jurisdiction:**
    *   **Question of Law:** This claim is a quintessential ""question of law"" under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D). It challenges the fundamental legal authority and proper constitution of the agency panel that rendered the decision. The court would need to interpret statutes and regulations governing the appointment, terms, and authority of BIA members (including temporary members) to determine if the BIA acted within its statutory mandate. This is a direct challenge to the legality of the administrative process itself.

---

### II. How Claims Are Typically Resolved

#### A. Resolution of the BIA's Finding of Lack of Good Moral Character (GMC)

1.  **If Jurisdiction Exists (Question of Law/Constitutional Claim):**
    *   **Legal Error:** If the Court of Appeals finds that the BIA committed a legal error in interpreting or applying the good moral character standard, it will typically **vacate** the BIA's decision and **remand** the case back to the BIA. The BIA would then be instructed to reconsider the alien's GMC in light of the correct legal standard.
    *   **Constitutional Violation:** If a due process violation is found, the court would also likely **vacate** and **remand** for a new, procedurally proper determination.
2.  **If No Jurisdiction or No Legal/Constitutional Error:**
    *   If the court determines it lacks jurisdiction (e.g., the challenge is purely factual), or if it finds no legal or constitutional error in the BIA's GMC finding (i.e., the BIA correctly applied the law and its factual findings are supported by substantial evidence), the court will **affirm** the BIA's decision. Since GMC is a statutory prerequisite for cancellation of removal and voluntary departure, a valid finding of lack of GMC means the alien is ineligible for these forms of relief, and the denial would stand.

#### B. Resolution of the Ultra Vires Claim (Expired Temporary BIA Members)

1.  **If Jurisdiction Exists (Question of Law):**
    *   The Court of Appeals would examine the relevant statutes and regulations governing the appointment and terms of BIA members. It would determine whether the temporary BIA members who decided the alien's case were lawfully serving at the time of the decision.
    *   **If the Claim is Successful:** If the court finds that the temporary BIA members' terms had indeed expired, or that their continued service was otherwise unlawful, rendering the BIA panel improperly constituted (i.e., the decision was ultra vires), the court will **vacate** the BIA's decision. The case would then be **remanded** to the BIA for a new decision by a properly constituted panel. This means the alien gets a fresh review of their case by a lawfully appointed body, but it does not guarantee a different outcome on the merits of cancellation or voluntary departure.
    *   **If the Claim is Unsuccessful:** If the court finds that the temporary BIA members were lawfully serving, or that the challenge to their authority is without merit, the court will **affirm** the BIA's decision on this procedural point. The court would then proceed to review any other properly raised claims (like the GMC claim, if reviewable).

---

In summary, the alien's best chance for review lies in framing their challenges as ""questions of law"" or ""constitutional claims."" The ultra vires claim is a strong candidate for review, as it directly questions the legality of the decision-making body itself. The GMC claim is reviewable only to the extent it involves a legal interpretation or a fundamental procedural flaw, not merely a disagreement with the BIA's factual conclusions.",[],,0.8270473480224609,13.25151913192462,36.0272425280792

*   **(B) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated; or**
*   **(C) the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action.**

Let's analyze each potential district:

**1. District of Columbia:**
*   **Proper Venue? Yes.** USCIS is a federal agency, and its headquarters are located in or near Washington, D.C. Many courts interpret § 1391(e)(1)(A) to mean that the ""residence"" of a federal agency for venue purposes is where its principal office is located. Therefore, the District of Columbia is a proper venue.

**2. Northern District of Texas:**
*   **Proper Venue? Yes.** The petition was processed and denied at a USCIS service center in the Northern District of Texas. The denial of the petition is the ""events or omissions giving rise to the claim."" Therefore, the Northern District of Texas is a proper venue under § 1391(e)(1)(B).

**3. District of Maryland:**
*   **Proper Venue? Yes.** The plaintiff resides in Maryland, and no real property is involved in this immigrant visa petition challenge. Therefore, the District of Maryland is a proper venue under § 1391(e)(1)(C).

**Conclusion on Proper Venue:**
Venue would be proper in **all three districts**: the District of Columbia, the Northern District of Texas, and the District of Maryland.

---

**Should the case be transferred there?**

The decision to transfer a case is governed by **28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)**, which states: ""For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.""

Since D.C. is a proper venue, the court must weigh the factors of convenience and the interest of justice to determine if a transfer is warranted.

**Factors to Consider:**

1.  **Plaintiff's Choice of Forum:** The plaintiff initially filed in the District of Columbia. While not absolute, a plaintiff's choice of forum is generally given some deference, especially when it is a proper venue.
2.  **Convenience of Parties:**
    *   **Plaintiff:** Resides in Maryland. The District of Maryland would be the most convenient forum for the plaintiff. The District of Columbia is also relatively convenient, being adjacent to Maryland. The Northern District of Texas would be significantly inconvenient for the plaintiff.
    *   **Government/USCIS:** The agency's headquarters are in D.C. The specific decision-makers are in the Northern District of Texas. However, in administrative review cases, the ""witnesses"" are typically the administrative record itself, which is usually electronic and accessible from anywhere. Live testimony from agency personnel is rare.
3.  **Convenience of Witnesses:** As noted, in administrative review cases, this factor often carries less weight as the primary ""witness"" is the administrative record. If any agency personnel were to testify, those involved in the specific denial would be in N.D. Texas, while policy-level officials might be in D.C.
4.  **Interest of Justice:** This is a broad category that includes factors like judicial economy, the local interest in the controversy, and the relative ease of access to sources of proof. D.C. courts have extensive experience with administrative law challenges against federal agencies.

**Analysis of Transfer Options:**

*   **Transfer to Northern District of Texas:** While N.D. Texas is where the denial occurred, transferring the case there would impose a significant burden on the plaintiff, who resides in Maryland. Given that the administrative record is likely electronic, the benefit of having the case in the district where the service center is located is often outweighed by the inconvenience to the plaintiff.
*   **Transfer to District of Maryland:** This would be the most convenient forum for the plaintiff. It is a proper venue, and the government itself has proposed it as an alternative. This would maximize the convenience for the party bringing the suit without unduly burdening the government, especially since the administrative record is electronic.
*   **Keep in District of Columbia:** D.C. is a proper venue and is geographically close to the plaintiff's residence in Maryland. D.C. courts are well-versed in federal administrative law.

**Recommendation:**

While the District of Columbia is a proper venue and the plaintiff's initial choice, a strong argument can be made for transferring the case to the **District of Maryland**.

*   **Rationale:** The District of Maryland is a proper venue under § 1391(e)(1)(C) because the plaintiff resides there. Transferring the case to Maryland would significantly enhance the convenience for the plaintiff, who is the party seeking relief, without imposing an undue burden on the government (especially given the electronic nature of administrative records). The government's willingness to consider Maryland as a transfer location further supports this.

Therefore, while the case could properly remain in D.C., the court **should transfer the case to the District of Maryland** for the convenience of the parties and in the interest of justice, primarily to accommodate the plaintiff's residence. Transferring to the Northern District of Texas would likely be denied due to the substantial inconvenience to the plaintiff.",[],,0.84061598777771,11.639088037899722,42.837949072246374
"Under U.S. immigration law, can a foreign-born child claim citizenship through a parent who never actually resided in the U.S., by arguing that the parent constructively satisfied statutory physical presence requirements for citizenship transmission, particularly when a foreign government's actions, rather than a U.S. government error, prevented actual physical presence?","No, the court affirmed that the constructive physical presence doctrine does not apply to transmit United States citizenship under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 in such circumstances. The Act's plain language provides only limited exceptions to physical presence requirements (for military service or government employment), and courts decline to read broader equitable exceptions into the statute. The precedent allowing constructive physical presence for transmission (*Matter of Navarrete*) is specifically limited to scenarios where a U.S. government error prevented compliance with the physical presence requirements. Since no U.S. government error caused the father's inability to reside in the U.S., the doctrine does not apply. Consequently, the related equal protection claim also fails because there was no differential treatment compared to a similarly situated individual (i.e., one affected by U.S. government error).",,,,,,,,"No, the court affirmed that the constructive physical presence doctrine does not apply to transmit United States citizenship under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 in such circumstances.

Consequently, the related equal protection claim also fails because there was no differential treatment compared to a similarly situated individual (i.e., one affected by U.S. government error).","No, under U.S. immigration law, a foreign-born child generally **cannot** claim citizenship through a parent who never actually resided in the U.S. by arguing that the parent constructively satisfied statutory physical presence requirements.

Here's why:

1.  **Strict Interpretation of Physical Presence:** U.S. citizenship law, particularly regarding the transmission of citizenship at birth abroad (under INA 301), interprets physical presence requirements very strictly. The statutes typically require *actual* physical presence in the United States by the U.S. citizen parent for a specified period *before* the child's birth.

2.  **No ""Constructive Presence"" Doctrine:** The concept of ""constructive physical presence"" is generally not recognized or accepted as a substitute for actual presence in the context of citizenship transmission. While ""constructive presence"" might be a concept in other areas of law (like tax or domicile), it is not applied to the strict statutory requirements for transmitting U.S. citizenship. Courts and administrative bodies have consistently held that the plain language of the statute requiring physical presence means just that – actual, bodily presence in the U.S.

3.  **Reason for Absence is Irrelevant:** The reason for the parent's inability to be physically present in the U.S. (even if due to compelling circumstances like the actions of a foreign government preventing their return) does not typically excuse the failure to meet the statutory physical presence requirement. U.S. law focuses on whether the U.S. citizen parent *actually* met the U.S. statutory criteria, not on the external factors that prevented them from doing so. This is distinct from situations where a U.S. government error might have prevented someone from meeting a requirement, which could potentially lead to equitable relief in some very specific circumstances, but not for the fundamental physical presence requirement for citizenship transmission.

**In summary:** For a foreign-born child to acquire citizenship through a U.S. citizen parent, the parent must have met the specific, statutorily defined physical presence requirements through *actual* residence in the United States. The theory of ""constructive satisfaction"" due to external impediments, even those caused by a foreign government, is not a recognized basis for claiming citizenship in this context.",[],,0.8447567820549011,13.254244306418219,29.297391304347855

This consequently qualifies it as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F) and 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), triggering removability and ineligibility for cancellation of removal.",,,,,,,,"Yes, a conviction for criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree in violation of N.Y.

This consequently qualifies it as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(F) and 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), triggering removability and ineligibility for cancellation of removal.","This is a complex question that requires a careful application of immigration law and criminal law principles, particularly the ""categorical approach"" used by courts.

Here's a breakdown:

**1. Is N.Y. Penal Law § 265.03(1)(b) a ""Crime of Violence"" under 18 U.S.C. § 16?**

To determine if a state conviction is a ""crime of violence"" under 18 U.S.C. § 16, courts apply the ""categorical approach,"" comparing the elements of the state statute to the federal definition.

18 U.S.C. § 16 defines ""crime of violence"" as:
*   **(a) the ""elements clause"":** an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or
*   **(b) the ""residual clause"":** any other offense that is a felony and, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.

Let's analyze N.Y. Penal Law § 265.03(1)(b): ""A person is guilty of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree when... (1) with intent to use the same unlawfully against another, such person possesses a loaded firearm.""

*   **Against § 16(a) (Elements Clause):** This clause requires that the *elements* of the state crime include the ""use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force."" N.Y. Penal Law § 265.03(1)(b) requires ""intent to use unlawfully against another."" While this intent is concerning and suggests a propensity for violence, the *mere intent* to use a weapon unlawfully is not the same as the *actual use, attempted use, or threatened use* of physical force. Possession with intent is a preparatory offense, not one that inherently involves the *use* of force as an element. Therefore, this conviction **does not** categorically fit within § 16(a).

*   **Against § 16(b) (Residual Clause):** The Supreme Court, in *Sessions v. Dimaya*, 584 U.S. 148 (2018), found the residual clause of 18 U.S.C. § 16(b) to be unconstitutionally vague. As a result, this clause **cannot** be used to define a ""crime of violence"" for immigration purposes.

**Conclusion for ""Crime of Violence"":** Based on current Supreme Court precedent, a conviction under N.Y. Penal Law § 265.03(1)(b) is **not** considered a ""crime of violence"" under 18 U.S.C. § 16.

**2. Is the Individual Removable as an Alien Convicted of an Aggravated Felony and Ineligible for Cancellation of Removal?**

Even though the conviction is not a ""crime of violence"" under 18 U.S.C. § 16, it can still be an ""aggravated felony"" under a *different* subsection of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).

The INA defines ""aggravated felony"" in 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43). One relevant category is:
*   **(E)(ii):** ""an offense described in section 921(a)(3) of title 18, United States Code (relating to firearms).""

N.Y. Penal Law § 265.03(1)(b) is a felony conviction for criminal possession of a loaded firearm with intent to use it unlawfully. This clearly falls under the category of an offense ""relating to firearms.""

Therefore, a conviction for N.Y. Penal Law § 265.03(1)(b) **is considered an aggravated felony** under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii) because it is a felony offense relating to firearms.

**Consequences of an Aggravated Felony Conviction for an LPR:**

*   **Removability:** An alien convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable (removable) under INA § 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) [8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii)].
*   **Ineligibility for Cancellation of Removal:** An alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony is ineligible for cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents under INA § 240A(a)(3) [8 U.S.C. § 1229b(a)(3)].

**Final Answer:**

While a conviction for N.Y. Penal Law § 265.03(1)(b) for criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree is **not** considered a ""crime of violence"" under 18 U.S.C. § 16 (due to the categorical approach and the unconstitutionality of the residual clause), it **is** considered an ""aggravated felony"" under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(E)(ii) as an offense ""relating to firearms.""

Therefore, as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, the individual **is removable** and **is ineligible for cancellation of removal**.",[],,0.8427587151527405,10.752016745159604,43.18861817547531
"A beneficiary of an I-140 petition requests to port to a new employer under 8 U.S.C. § 1154(j) while the I-140 petition is still pending. USCIS subsequently issues a Request for Evidence (RFE) for the I-140 petition but sends it only to the original petitioning employer. The original employer fails to respond, and USCIS denies the petition. The beneficiary attempts to appeal the denial but is told they are not a recognized party. Did USCIS act improperly in this scenario?","Yes, USCIS acted improperly. The court ruled that when an I-140 petition is pending before USCIS and the agency receives notice that the beneficiary has requested to port to a new employer, USCIS acts inconsistently with the portability provision (8 U.S.C. § 1154(j)) if it continues to treat only the original employer as a party to the petition adjudication proceeding.

Consequently, the court vacated the denial of the I-140 petition and remanded the case for USCIS to provide the beneficiary an opportunity to respond to the request for evidence.","No, USCIS did not act improperly in this scenario. Here's a breakdown of why:

1.  **I-140 Petition is Employer-Sponsored:** The I-140 Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker is filed by the *employer* (the petitioner) on behalf of the foreign national (the beneficiary). As such, the employer is the primary party to the petition.

2.  **RFE Sent to the Petitioner:** USCIS's standard and proper procedure is to communicate directly with the petitioner (or their authorized legal representative) regarding the I-140 petition. Since the employer is the petitioner, sending the RFE only to the original petitioning employer is correct. The beneficiary is not a party to the I-140 petition in the same legal sense as the employer and therefore does not typically receive direct communications like RFEs.

3.  **Denial Due to Non-Response:** If an RFE is issued and the petitioner fails to respond within the allotted time, USCIS is within its rights to deny the petition based on the available evidence (or lack thereof).

4.  **Beneficiary's Standing to Appeal:** For an I-140 petition, only the *petitioner* (the employer) has the legal standing to appeal a denial. The beneficiary, while directly impacted by the outcome, is not considered a party with the right to appeal the denial of an I-140 petition.

5.  **AC21 Portability (8 U.S.C. § 1154(j)) Requirements:** The beneficiary's request to port under AC21 is also a critical point. Portability under INA 204(j) (8 U.S.C. § 1154(j)) generally requires that:
    *   The I-140 petition has been *approved*.
    *   An I-485 adjustment of status application has been pending for *180 days or more*.

    In this scenario, the I-140 petition was *still pending* when the beneficiary requested to port. Therefore, the conditions for AC21 portability had not yet been met. The denial of the I-140 petition means that the beneficiary would not have been eligible to port under AC21 anyway, as there would be no approved I-140 to port from.

In summary, USCIS followed established procedures by communicating with the petitioner, denying the petition due to non-response, and correctly informing the beneficiary that they lacked standing to appeal the I-140 denial. The beneficiary's attempt to port was premature given the pending status of the I-140.",[],,0.8470324277877808,12.55861484593838,36.81640966386556
"An alien from El Salvador seeks asylum and withholding of removal in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security presents an Interpol Red Notice indicating an active warrant for the alien's arrest in El Salvador for violating Article 345 of the Salvadoran Penal Code, which proscribes participation in an illicit organization whose purpose is the commission of crimes. The Red Notice also suggests the alien is a ""hit man"" for a gang. Can the Interpol Red Notice constitute sufficient evidence to trigger the serious nonpolitical crime bar, and how would the court assess the ""seriousness"" of such a crime for purposes of asylum and withholding eligibility?","Yes, an Interpol Red Notice may constitute reliable evidence indicating that the serious nonpolitical crime bar for asylum and withholding of removal applies to an alien.

### I. Can the Interpol Red Notice Constitute Sufficient Evidence to Trigger the Serious Nonpolitical Crime Bar?

Yes, an Interpol Red Notice, especially one with the level of detail provided, **can constitute sufficient evidence** to trigger the serious nonpolitical crime bar, though its sufficiency often depends on the specific facts and corroborating evidence.

1.  **Government's Burden of Proof:** The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) bears the burden of proving that the alien committed a serious nonpolitical crime. For asylum, the standard is ""serious reasons for considering that the alien has committed a serious nonpolitical crime."" For withholding of removal, it's ""reasonable grounds to believe that the alien has committed a serious nonpolitical crime."" Both standards are lower than ""preponderance of the evidence"" but higher than ""mere suspicion.""

2.  **Nature of an Interpol Red Notice:**
    *   An Interpol Red Notice is an international alert issued by Interpol at the request of a member country. It is a request to law enforcement worldwide to provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.
    *   **It is not a conviction.** It indicates an active arrest warrant and serious allegations, but it does not mean the individual has been found guilty in a court of law.
    *   However, it is an official document from a foreign government, indicating a formal legal process is underway.

3.  **Precedent from *Matter of T-M-B-*:** The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has addressed the evidentiary value of Interpol Red Notices. In *Matter of T-M-B-*, 21 I&N Dec. 775 (BIA 1997), the BIA held that an Interpol Red Notice, **coupled with other corroborating evidence**, can be sufficient to establish ""reasonable grounds to believe"" that an alien committed a serious nonpolitical crime.
    *   While *T-M-B-* suggested corroboration, the *detail* within the Red Notice itself is crucial. A Red Notice that merely states ""wanted for crime"" might not be enough.
    *   **In this specific case:** The Red Notice is highly detailed:
        *   It specifies an **active warrant**.
        *   It cites a **specific penal code article (Article 345 of the Salvadoran Penal Code)**. This allows the court to look up the specific law and understand the nature of the alleged crime.
        *   It describes the crime: **""participation in an illicit organization whose purpose is the commission of crimes.""** This is a serious allegation of organized criminal activity.
        *   It further suggests the alien is a **""hit man"" for a gang.** This is an extremely grave allegation, implying direct involvement in murder or conspiracy to commit murder.

4.  **Conclusion on Sufficiency:** Given the specific and serious allegations contained within this Red Notice (active warrant, specific penal code violation, participation in an illicit criminal organization, and the ""hit man"" designation), it would likely be considered **strong evidence**, and potentially **sufficient on its own** to meet the ""reasonable grounds to believe"" or ""serious reasons for considering"" standard, even without extensive additional corroboration. The ""hit man"" allegation, in particular, points to an inherently serious crime. The alien would then have the opportunity to rebut this evidence.

### II. How Would the Court Assess the ""Seriousness"" of Such a Crime?

The court (an Immigration Judge, and on appeal, the BIA or federal circuit courts) would assess the ""seriousness"" of the crime by considering several factors, focusing on the nature and impact of the alleged offense:

1.  **Nature of the Crime:**
    *   **Inherent Gravity:** Crimes like murder, torture, terrorism, drug trafficking, and violent assault are almost universally considered serious.
    *   **Organized Crime:** ""Participation in an illicit organization whose purpose is the commission of crimes"" (Article 345) falls squarely into the category of organized crime. This is inherently serious because it involves a concerted effort to undermine public safety and the rule of law.
    *   **""Hit Man"" Allegation:** This is perhaps the most critical detail. Being a ""hit man"" implies direct involvement in contract killings, attempted murder, or conspiracy to commit murder. These are among the most serious crimes imaginable.

2.  **Harm Caused or Intended:**
    *   The court would consider the actual or potential harm to individuals and society. Organized criminal activity, especially involving ""hit men,"" causes immense societal harm, including violence, intimidation, and destabilization.

3.  **Penalties Imposed or Potentially Imposed:**
    *   While not determinative, the severity of the potential sentence under Salvadoran law for violating Article 345 would be considered. Crimes carrying lengthy prison sentences (e.g., 5+ years) are generally indicative of seriousness. Participation in criminal organizations and murder typically carry very severe penalties.

4.  **International Consensus:**
    *   The court would consider how such crimes are viewed internationally. Organized crime, gang violence, and contract killings are universally condemned as serious offenses.

5.  **Disproportionate Violence (for ""nonpolitical"" aspect, but relevant to gravity):**
    *   While the question focuses on ""seriousness,"" the court would also implicitly consider if the alleged acts involved disproportionate or atrocious violence, which often points to seriousness. Being a ""hit man"" certainly fits this description.

6.  **Lack of Political Motivation (for ""nonpolitical"" aspect):**
    *   For the crime to be ""serious nonpolitical,"" it must also lack a genuine political objective. Gang activity, even if it involves violence and seeks to control territory, is generally considered nonpolitical because its primary aims are power, profit, and control, rather than genuine political change or the overthrow of a government. The ""hit man"" role is almost always for personal gain, revenge, or to enforce gang control, not for a political purpose in the sense required by refugee law.

**In conclusion:** The court would almost certainly find the alleged crime of ""participation in an illicit organization whose purpose is the commission of crimes,"" especially with the specific allegation of being a ""hit man"" for a gang, to be a **serious nonpolitical crime**. The nature of the alleged acts, the potential for extreme violence and harm, and the lack of a genuine political motive would weigh heavily in favor of triggering the bar, making the alien ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal.",[],,0.8345548510551453,14.347075494165278,26.705870842264062
"An asylum seeker submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for all documents related to their asylum application, which was granted in 2013.

Here's the likely outcome:

1.  **Initial Stance:** The government will likely maintain its position that the official grant date of 2013 is the ""final decision"" for the purpose of Exemption 5. Therefore, documents from 2010-2012 would be considered predecisional and deliberative, reflecting internal discussions, recommendations, and opinions leading up to that 2013 decision.

2.  **Asylum Seeker's Challenge:** The asylum seeker has a strong legal basis to challenge this. The core of their argument is that if a *de facto* final decision was made in 2010, then documents generated *after* that point (2010-2012) are no longer ""predecisional"" to *that specific decision*. Instead, they would be post-decisional or relate to the implementation of the decision, and thus generally fall outside the scope of Exemption 5.

3.  **Key Factors for Determination:**
    *   **Evidence of a 2010 Decision:** The asylum seeker would need to present compelling evidence or argument that a final, substantive decision to grant asylum was indeed made in 2010, even if the official notification or final paperwork wasn't completed until 2013. This could involve internal agency communications, a specific action taken by the agency, or a change in the applicant's status that functionally constituted a grant.
    *   **Agency's Justification:** The government would need to specifically explain *why* the 2013 date is the definitive final decision and how the 2010-2012 documents remained part of the *deliberative process leading to that 2013 decision*, rather than being post-decisional to an earlier grant. They would need to demonstrate that the documents still reflect opinions, recommendations, or advice that were subject to change before the final 2013 action.
    *   **Nature of the Documents:** Even if the 2013 date is upheld, purely factual information within the documents (e.g., dates, names, objective data) must be disclosed, as Exemption 5 only protects the deliberative portions. The agency has a duty to segregate and release non-exempt material.

**Likely Outcome:**

The outcome is **highly dependent on whether the asylum seeker can successfully demonstrate that a final decision was effectively made in 2010.**

*   **If the asylum seeker can provide compelling evidence that the agency made a final, substantive decision to grant asylum in 2010 (even if the formal notification was delayed),** then the documents from 2010-2012 would likely be deemed post-decisional to *that* decision and would **likely be disclosed**, as Exemption 5 would no longer apply to them. The government's burden to prove the documents are predecisional to the *final* decision would be significantly harder to meet.
*   **If the asylum seeker cannot provide such evidence, and the government can credibly argue that the 2010-2012 documents were still part of an ongoing, evolving deliberative process that culminated in the *final* decision in 2013,** then the government's Exemption 5 claim would likely be upheld, and the documents would **likely remain withheld** (subject to segregability of factual information).

In practice, this often leads to a back-and-forth between the requester and the agency, potentially escalating to an administrative appeal or even litigation, where a court would ultimately decide the ""final decision"" date based on the evidence presented by both parties. The burden of proof to justify the withholding remains with the government.",[],,0.8289165496826172,16.45864179104478,24.79605970149254
"Imagine a noncitizen, Ms. A, was convicted under a state law that criminalizes accessory-after-the-fact with a ""general intent"" requirement. Federal immigration authorities classify this conviction as an ""aggravated felony"" related to obstruction of justice, which generically requires ""specific intent,"" and initiate expedited removal proceedings. Ms. A argues the state law is not a categorical match and that the expedited removal process violated her due process rights due to procedural errors.

The court would grant the petition for review, vacate the removal order, and remand the case, directing the government to facilitate the noncitizen's return for further proceedings.","Based on a federal court's review, here's the likely outcome regarding Ms. A's aggravated felony classification and the validity of her removal order:

1.  **Aggravated Felony Classification (Categorical Match):**
    *   **Likely Outcome:** Ms. A is highly likely to succeed in arguing that her state conviction for accessory-after-the-fact with a ""general intent"" requirement is *not* a categorical match for an ""aggravated felony"" related to obstruction of justice, which generically requires ""specific intent.""
    *   **Reasoning:** Federal courts apply the ""categorical approach"" (and sometimes the ""modified categorical approach"") to determine if a state conviction matches a generic federal offense for immigration purposes. This approach compares the elements of the state statute of conviction to the elements of the generic federal offense. A key element is *mens rea* (the mental state required for the crime).
        *   The generic federal offense of ""obstruction of justice"" (and related aggravated felonies) almost universally requires *specific intent* to obstruct, impede, or influence the administration of justice.
        *   Ms. A's conviction was under a state law requiring only ""general intent.""
        *   If the state statute criminalizes conduct with a lower *mens rea* (general intent) than the generic federal offense requires (specific intent), then the state statute is *broader* than the federal offense. Under the categorical approach, if the least culpable conduct criminalized by the state statute does not meet the elements of the generic federal offense, there is no categorical match.
        *   Therefore, the federal court would likely find that the state conviction, requiring only general intent, does not categorically match the specific intent requirement of an aggravated felony for obstruction of justice. This would mean Ms. A's conviction is *not* an aggravated felony.

2.  **Validity of Removal Order (Due Process):**
    *   **Likely Outcome:** If Ms. A can demonstrate that the procedural errors in her expedited removal proceedings were substantial and prejudiced her, the federal court *could* find a due process violation.
    *   **Reasoning:** While judicial review of expedited removal orders is limited, federal courts retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims, including due process challenges. To succeed on a due process claim in removal proceedings, Ms. A would generally need to show:
        1.  A procedural error occurred.
        2.  The error deprived her of a fundamental right (e.g., the right to a full and fair hearing, the opportunity to present her case).
        3.  The error caused her prejudice (i.e., the outcome of her case might have been different without the error).
    *   Given that the underlying aggravated felony classification is likely to be overturned, any procedural errors that prevented her from effectively challenging that classification or presenting other defenses would be particularly relevant.
    *   **Remedy:** If a due process violation is found, the typical remedy is not to terminate the removal proceedings outright, but to *remand* the case back to the immigration agency (e.g., the Board of Immigration Appeals or an Immigration Judge) for new proceedings consistent with due process.

**Overall Conclusion:**

Ms. A has a very strong argument against the aggravated felony classification due to the clear mismatch in the *mens rea* requirement between her state conviction (general intent) and the generic federal offense of obstruction of justice (specific intent). A federal court is highly likely to agree with her on this point, which would mean her conviction is *not* an aggravated felony.

Regarding her due process claim, its success depends on the specific nature and impact of the procedural errors. However, if she can demonstrate material errors that prejudiced her, especially in light of the likely incorrect aggravated felony classification, the court could find a due process violation and remand her case for new, properly conducted proceedings. The removal order, as issued under the premise of an aggravated felony, would likely be invalidated or at least subject to re-evaluation.",[],,0.825271487236023,13.99490254426425,27.7036596736597

Here's why:

1.  **Vacated Order is Nullified:** When the BIA grants a motion to reconsider and ""expressly vacates"" the initial order, that initial order is rendered null and void. It ceases to be a legally operative decision. There is no longer a live controversy regarding that specific order for the court to review.

2.  **Mootness:** The petition for judicial review filed against the initial order becomes moot. A federal court can only hear ""cases and controversies."" Once the underlying order has been vacated and replaced, there is no longer any effective relief the court can grant with respect to the original order.

3.  **New Final Agency Action:** The BIA's issuance of a new order, especially one with ""materially different reasoning,"" constitutes a new and distinct final agency action. For a party to seek judicial review of this new order, they typically must file a **new petition for judicial review** within the statutory timeframe (usually 30 days from the date of the new BIA order).

4.  **Focus on the Operative Decision:** Federal appellate courts review the *final, operative* decision of the administrative agency. Once the BIA has superseded its initial decision with a new one, the new decision is the one that must be challenged.

Here's a breakdown of the likely reasoning based on precedent:

### I. Argument 1: Texas Statute is Indivisible and Not a Categorical Match

**Precedent:** The Supreme Court's decisions in *Mathis v. United States*, *Descamps v. United States*, and *Pereira v. Sessions* govern the categorical and modified categorical approaches.

*   **Categorical Approach:** A court first compares the elements of the state statute of conviction to the elements of the federal immigration offense. If the state statute criminalizes a broader range of conduct than the federal offense, it is not a categorical match.
*   **Modified Categorical Approach:** If the state statute is ""divisible"" – meaning it lists alternative elements in the disjunctive, some of which would match the federal offense and some would not – the court may then look to a limited class of documents from the record of conviction (e.g., indictment, jury instructions, plea agreement, judgment) to determine which alternative element formed the basis of the conviction.

**Application:**

1.  **Divisibility of Texas Penal Code § 22.04(a):** Texas Penal Code § 22.04(a) states: ""A person commits an offense if he intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or with criminal negligence, by act or omission, causes to a **child, elderly individual, or disabled individual**: (1) serious bodily injury; (2) **bodily injury**; (3) disability; (4) disfigurement; or (5) impairment or endangerment.""
    *   This statute is clearly **divisible**. It lists alternative victim types (child, elderly, disabled) and alternative types of harm (serious bodily injury, bodily injury, etc.) in the disjunctive.
    *   The federal ground for removal, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), specifically refers to a ""crime of **child** abuse."" The Texas statute's inclusion of ""elderly individual"" or ""disabled individual"" means it is not a categorical match to the federal definition.

2.  **Application of Modified Categorical Approach:** Because the statute is divisible, the court would apply the modified categorical approach. The plea agreement explicitly indicated that the victim was a ""child younger than 14."" This document from the record of conviction clearly establishes that the conviction was for injury to a *child*, not an elderly or disabled individual.

**Likely Ruling on Argument 1:** The federal court of appeals would **reject** the argument that the Texas statute is indivisible. It would find the statute divisible and, by applying the modified categorical approach and reviewing the plea agreement, determine that the conviction was specifically for injury to a *child*.

### II. Argument 2: State's Definition of ""Bodily Injury"" is Overbroad

**Precedent:** Federal courts, particularly the Fifth Circuit (which covers Texas), have consistently addressed the scope of Texas's definition of ""bodily injury"" in the context of federal immigration and sentencing laws.

*   **Federal Definition of ""Crime of Child Abuse"":** While 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) does not explicitly define ""child abuse,"" courts generally interpret it to encompass conduct that causes physical or mental injury, sexual abuse, exploitation, or neglect of a child. The core concept involves some form of harm or injury.
*   **Texas Definition of ""Bodily Injury"":** Texas Penal Code § 1.07(a)(8) defines ""bodily injury"" as ""physical pain, illness, or any impairment of physical condition.""

**Application:**

1.  **Comparison of Definitions:** The individual argues that ""physical pain, illness, or any impairment of physical condition"" is overbroad compared to the federal concept of ""injury"" in child abuse.
    *   **""Physical pain"" and ""illness"":** These elements are generally considered to fall squarely within the common understanding of ""injury"" or ""harm"" in the context of child abuse.
    *   **""Any impairment of physical condition"":** This is the most likely point of contention. However, federal courts, including the Fifth Circuit, have generally held that Texas's definition of ""bodily injury"" is *not* overbroad when compared to federal standards for ""physical injury"" or ""bodily injury"" in various contexts (e.g., crimes of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines, crimes involving moral turpitude). While ""any impairment"" could theoretically be very minor, courts typically interpret it as requiring some actual physical detriment, which aligns with the concept of ""injury"" in child abuse. The focus is on whether the state definition requires *some* level of physical harm, which Texas's definition does.

2.  **""By Omission"":** The fact that the injury occurred ""by omission"" is also consistent with the federal definition of ""child abuse,"" as neglect (a form of omission) is a recognized component of child abuse.

**Likely Ruling on Argument 2:** The federal court of appeals would **reject** the argument that Texas's definition of ""bodily injury"" is overbroad. Based on established precedent, the court would likely find that ""physical pain, illness, or any impairment of physical condition"" is sufficiently aligned with the federal understanding of ""injury"" or ""harm"" to a child for the purpose of establishing a ""crime of child abuse.""

### Conclusion

A federal court of appeals would likely **affirm** the Department of Homeland Security's assertion that the conviction under Texas Penal Code § 22.04(a) for ""injury to a child by omission"" is a ""crime of child abuse"" under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(E)(i). The court would apply the modified categorical approach, use the plea agreement to confirm the victim was a child, and find that Texas's definition of ""bodily injury"" is not overbroad compared to the federal understanding of child abuse.",[],,0.8299370408058167,14.293991112080484,27.91406608686171

Here's a breakdown:

**1. Withholding of Removal Claim: BIA Likely Erred**

The BIA's actions regarding the withholding of removal claim present several significant errors:

*   **Making New Factual Findings Without Remand:** When an applicant establishes past persecution, a presumption of future persecution arises. To rebut this presumption, the government (or the BIA on review) must show by a preponderance of the evidence that conditions have changed to such an extent that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear, or that the applicant could safely relocate. The BIA is primarily an appellate body, not a fact-finding one.
    *   **Error:** By relying on ""facts not found by the IJ"" to rebut the presumption of future persecution without remanding the case to the Immigration Judge (IJ) for further fact-finding, the BIA overstepped its appellate role. This deprives the applicant of the opportunity to present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, or respond to these new facts, violating principles of due process and fair hearing. The proper procedure, if new facts are relevant, is generally to remand to the IJ.

*   **Failure to Explicitly Address the ""Pattern-or-Practice"" Claim:** Even if the presumption of future persecution is rebutted, an applicant can still qualify for withholding of removal by demonstrating a ""pattern or practice"" of persecution against similarly situated individuals in the country of removal.
    *   **Error:** The BIA is required to provide a reasoned decision that addresses all material issues raised by the applicant. By failing to explicitly address the applicant's alternative ""pattern-or-practice"" claim, the BIA failed to fulfill its duty to provide a comprehensive and reasoned decision. This could mean the BIA overlooked a valid ground for relief.

**2. Convention Against Torture (CAT) Claim: BIA's Handling Not Inherently Erroneous (Based on Description)**

*   **Affirming by Incorporating IJ's Reasoning:** The BIA's decision to affirm the denial of the CAT claim by incorporating the IJ's reasoning is, by itself, not an error. Appellate bodies frequently adopt the reasoning of the lower tribunal when they find that reasoning to be sound and legally correct.
    *   **No Error (as described):** As long as the IJ's underlying reasoning was legally sound, supported by the evidence, and addressed all relevant arguments, the BIA's incorporation of that reasoning is a permissible and common method of appellate review. The prompt does not provide details about the *substance* of the IJ's reasoning, only the *method* of the BIA's affirmation. Therefore, based solely on the information provided, the BIA's *method* of handling the CAT claim was not erroneous. An error would only arise if the IJ's reasoning itself was flawed, which the prompt does not state.

**Conclusion:**

The BIA likely erred significantly in its handling of the **withholding of removal claim** by making new factual findings without remand and by failing to address a material alternative claim. Its handling of the **CAT claim**, by incorporating the IJ's reasoning, is not inherently erroneous unless the IJ's underlying reasoning was flawed.",[],,0.8449901938438416,15.38819863013699,30.244215753424697
"An individual in removal proceedings, a native and citizen of Cameroon, seeks review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision.

Therefore, the petition for review regarding the denial of the motion to remand is denied.","Based on general principles of immigration law and judicial review:

**1. Jurisdiction to Review the BIA's Affirmance of the Continuance Denial:**

*   **Generally No Jurisdiction:** Courts of Appeals generally lack jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions made by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) or an Immigration Judge (IJ). This is codified in **INA § 242(a)(2)(B)(ii)**, which states that ""no court shall have jurisdiction to review... any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security.""
*   **Motion to Continue is Discretionary:** A motion to continue removal proceedings is a quintessential discretionary decision. The IJ's decision to grant or deny a continuance is reviewed for abuse of discretion. The IJ's reasoning in this case (failure to show good cause, untimeliness, and lack of diligence) directly relates to the exercise of this discretion.
*   **Limited Exceptions:** While **INA § 242(a)(2)(D)** allows for judicial review of ""constitutional claims or questions of law,"" a denial of a motion to continue based on the facts presented (untimeliness, lack of diligence) is typically considered an application of a discretionary standard to the facts, not a pure question of law or a constitutional claim.
*   **Conclusion on Jurisdiction:** Therefore, it is highly probable that the **Court of Appeals would lack jurisdiction** to review the BIA's affirmance of the IJ's denial of the motion to continue. This decision falls squarely within the discretionary bar to judicial review.

**2. Did the BIA Abuse its Discretion in Denying the Motion to Remand?**

*   **Standard of Review:** The BIA's denial of a motion to remand is reviewed for abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. The BIA must provide a rational explanation for its decision.
*   **Requirements for Remand for Adjustment of Status:** For a motion to remand to pursue adjustment of status, the applicant typically needs to demonstrate:
    1.  **Prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status:** This includes having an approved visa petition (like the I-130 in this case).
    2.  **Immediate availability of a visa number:** The priority date for the approved I-130 must be current according to the Visa Bulletin.
    3.  **That the applicant merits a favorable exercise of discretion:** Even if statutorily eligible, adjustment of status is discretionary.
*   **Analysis of the Facts:**
    *   **Approved I-130:** The fact that the I-130 petition *was approved* is a significant development and satisfies one key requirement for *prima facie* eligibility.
    *   **Missing Information (Crucial):** The prompt *does not state whether a visa number was immediately available* at the time the motion to remand was filed (i.e., whether the priority date was current). This is a critical factor.
        *   If the priority date was *not* current, the BIA would almost certainly *not* have abused its discretion in denying the motion to remand, as the individual would not be immediately eligible for adjustment of status. The BIA is not required to remand a case to await a future visa availability.
        *   If the priority date *was* current, and the individual appeared otherwise *prima facie* eligible for adjustment (e.g., no obvious bars to adjustment, no significant negative discretionary factors), then the BIA's denial might be more susceptible to an abuse of discretion challenge. In such a scenario, the BIA would need to articulate a rational basis for denying the remand despite the apparent eligibility.
*   **Conclusion on Abuse of Discretion:**
    *   **Likely No Abuse (if visa not current):** If the priority date for the approved I-130 was *not* current at the time the motion to remand was filed, the BIA would **not have abused its discretion** in denying the motion. An approved I-130 alone does not guarantee immediate eligibility for adjustment of status.
    *   **Potential Abuse (if visa current and no other bars):** If the priority date *was* current, and the individual presented a strong *prima facie* case for adjustment of status (including eligibility for any necessary waivers and no significant negative discretionary factors), and the BIA failed to provide a rational explanation for its denial, then it **could be argued that the BIA abused its discretion**. However, the BIA still retains broad discretion in such matters, and the burden is high to show that their decision was arbitrary or capricious.

Without knowing whether a visa number was immediately available, it's difficult to definitively conclude on the abuse of discretion for the remand denial. However, the BIA often requires more than just an approved petition; immediate visa availability is a common prerequisite for granting a remand for adjustment of status.",[],,0.8237352967262268,15.228391608391608,27.279923748567825
"An alien was apprehended after illegal entry and provided an address to immigration officials. The address was deficient, leading to returned mail and the alien's in absentia removal. Eighteen years later, the alien moves to reopen removal proceedings, asserting that a different, correct address was initially provided and that the immigration officer made an error, thus entitling the alien to notice. The alien further argues that the original Notice to Appear (NTA) was defective for failing to specify the date and time of the hearing, making them eligible for cancellation of removal, particularly in light of subsequent Supreme Court precedent that clarified the ""stop-time rule."" How should a court rule on the alien's motion to reopen and claim of eligibility for cancellation of removal?","The court would deny the petition for review.

Here's how a court should rule:

**I. Motion to Reopen Based on Lack of Notice**

1.  **General Rule and Exceptions:**
    *   Motions to reopen removal proceedings generally have strict time limits (e.g., 90 days from the date of the final administrative order of removal).
    *   However, there are exceptions. For an *in absentia* removal order, an alien may file a motion to reopen:
        *   Within 180 days if the failure to appear was due to ""exceptional circumstances.""
        *   **At any time** if the alien did not receive notice of the hearing or if the alien was in federal or state custody and the failure to appear was through no fault of the alien. This is the ""lack of notice"" exception the alien is asserting.

2.  **Burden of Proof for Lack of Notice:**
    *   The burden is on the alien to demonstrate that they did not receive proper notice.
    *   If the government sent notice to the alien's last known address, there is a presumption of effective service. The alien must rebut this presumption.
    *   The alien's claim that a ""different, correct address was initially provided"" and that the ""immigration officer made an error"" is crucial here. The court would need to conduct a factual inquiry to determine:
        *   **What address did the alien actually provide?** This would involve reviewing the alien's initial intake forms, interview notes, and any other relevant documentation.
        *   **Was the address provided by the alien correct and complete?**
        *   **Did the immigration officer transcribe or record the address incorrectly?**
        *   **Did the alien fulfill their ongoing obligation to keep immigration authorities updated on their address?** (This is a significant factor, as aliens are generally required to notify DHS of any change of address within 10 days).

3.  **Impact of 18-Year Delay:**
    *   While the ""lack of notice"" exception has no statutory time limit, courts generally expect motions to be filed with reasonable diligence. An 18-year delay is substantial.
    *   The court would likely scrutinize why the alien waited so long to challenge the removal order. The alien would need to provide a compelling explanation for this delay, especially if they were aware of the removal order (e.g., through returned mail, or later attempts to re-enter the U.S.).
    *   If the alien genuinely had no knowledge of the proceedings or the removal order until recently, the delay might be excused. However, if the alien knew or should have known and simply chose not to act, the court might view the delay unfavorably, even if the ""no time limit"" rule technically applies.

4.  **Ruling on the Motion to Reopen:**
    *   **If the court finds the alien credibly provided a correct address, and the government's error led to the lack of notice:** The motion to reopen should be granted, as the alien was denied due process. The 18-year delay, while significant, would be less of a barrier if the alien truly had no notice and acted reasonably once they became aware.
    *   **If the court finds the alien provided a deficient address, failed to update their address, or cannot prove government error:** The motion to reopen would likely be denied as untimely, as the alien would not qualify for the ""lack of notice"" exception, and the general 90-day time limit would have long passed.

**II. NTA Defectiveness and Eligibility for Cancellation of Removal (Stop-Time Rule)**

1.  **The ""Stop-Time Rule"" and Supreme Court Precedent:**
    *   To be eligible for cancellation of removal under INA § 240A(b)(1), an alien must, among other things, demonstrate 10 years of ""continuous physical presence"" in the U.S.
    *   The ""stop-time rule"" states that the period of continuous physical presence is deemed to end when the alien is served with a Notice to Appear (NTA).
    *   *Pereira v. Sessions* (2018) and *Niz-Chavez v. Garland* (2021) clarified that an NTA that fails to specify the date and time of the initial removal hearing (a ""defective NTA"") does *not* trigger the stop-time rule. This means that continuous physical presence continues to accrue until a subsequent notice *does* specify the date and time, or until the alien is served with a perfected NTA.

2.  **Application to this Case:**
    *   **Contingency:** This argument only becomes relevant if the alien's motion to reopen is granted. If the motion is denied, the original removal order stands, and the question of cancellation of removal eligibility is moot.
    *   **If the motion to reopen is granted:** The court would then consider the merits of the alien's claim regarding the NTA.
    *   **NTA Defectiveness:** If the original NTA indeed failed to specify the date and time of the hearing, then under *Pereira* and *Niz-Chavez*, it would not have triggered the stop-time rule.
    *   **Accrual of Continuous Physical Presence:** This would mean the alien's continuous physical presence continued to accrue *past* the date of service of that defective NTA. Given that 18 years have passed since the initial apprehension, it is highly likely the alien would have accrued the necessary 10 years of continuous physical presence, provided they meet the other requirements (e.g., no breaks in presence that would reset the clock, no disqualifying criminal convictions).

3.  **Jurisdiction vs. Stop-Time Rule:**
    *   It's important to note that while a defective NTA doesn't trigger the stop-time rule, it doesn't necessarily mean the immigration court lacked jurisdiction to issue the *in absentia* order. The Supreme Court in *Pereira* specifically addressed the stop-time rule, not the jurisdictional validity of all NTAs. Subsequent circuit court decisions (e.g., *Mizrahi v. Garland*, 11th Cir. 2021) and BIA decisions (*Matter of Mendoza-Hernandez*, 2021) have clarified that an NTA lacking a date and time can still vest jurisdiction in the immigration court if a subsequent notice of hearing is sent.
    *   However, the alien's argument here is not that the *in absentia* order was jurisdictionally void *because* of the NTA defect (though that could be a secondary argument if the motion to reopen is granted), but rather that the NTA defect makes them eligible for cancellation of removal by preventing the stop-time rule from being triggered.

**Conclusion:**

The court's ruling will primarily hinge on the **motion to reopen** and the factual dispute regarding the **address and notice**.

*   **If the alien can credibly prove that they provided a correct address and the government made an error, leading to a lack of notice, the motion to reopen should be granted.** In this scenario, the 18-year delay, while long, might be excused if the alien genuinely lacked notice and acted with reasonable diligence upon becoming aware.
*   **If the motion to reopen is granted, then the alien's claim for eligibility for cancellation of removal based on the defective NTA and the stop-time rule would likely succeed.** The defective NTA would not have triggered the stop-time rule, allowing the alien to accrue the 10 years of continuous physical presence. The alien would then have the opportunity to present their case for cancellation of removal, demonstrating good moral character and exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative.
*   **However, if the alien fails to prove government error or a lack of notice, or if the court finds the 18-year delay to be unreasonable despite a potential lack of notice, the motion to reopen will be denied.** In that case, the original *in absentia* removal order stands, and the arguments regarding the NTA and cancellation of removal eligibility become irrelevant.

Given the extreme delay, the alien faces a significant uphill battle to convince the court that the motion to reopen is warranted, even under the ""lack of notice"" exception. The factual determination of who was at fault for the deficient address will be critical.",[],,0.8083228468894958,12.971573786566434,40.94018957345972
