"An individual in removal proceedings had their application for asylum and other relief denied due to failure to submit biometrics, despite being previously instructed by the Immigration Judge while pro se. They subsequently retained counsel, who also failed to advise them about the biometrics requirement.

Additionally, the court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA's discretionary decision not to invoke its *sua sponte* authority to reopen a case.","This individual faces significant challenges in overturning the denial of their motion to reopen, both regarding equitable tolling and compelling *sua sponte* reopening.

Here's a breakdown:

**I. Equitable Tolling Due to Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (IAC)**

1.  **The 90-Day Deadline:** Motions to reopen generally must be filed within 90 days of the date of the final administrative order of removal (8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(2)). The individual in this scenario filed *more than 90 days* after the final order.

2.  **Equitable Tolling Standard:** Equitable tolling allows for the extension of a filing deadline when an applicant has pursued their rights diligently but some extraordinary circumstance prevented timely filing. To successfully invoke equitable tolling, the applicant must typically show:
    *   **Diligence:** They acted with reasonable diligence in pursuing their rights.
    *   **Extraordinary Circumstance:** An extraordinary circumstance prevented timely filing.

3.  **Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (IAC) as an Extraordinary Circumstance:** IAC *can* be an extraordinary circumstance justifying equitable tolling. To establish IAC, an applicant must generally meet the requirements set forth in *Matter of Lozada*, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), which include:
    *   An affidavit from the applicant setting forth the agreement with counsel regarding the representation.
    *   Evidence that counsel was informed of the allegations and given an opportunity to respond.
    *   Proof that counsel's performance was deficient.
    *   **Prejudice:** That the applicant was prejudiced by counsel's performance (i.e., the outcome would have been different but for the deficient performance).

4.  **Application to the Facts - Challenges:**

    *   **Diligence and Prior Knowledge:** This is the most significant hurdle for the individual. They were *previously instructed by the Immigration Judge while pro se* about the biometrics requirement. This fact severely undermines their claim of diligence and that the IAC was the *sole* extraordinary circumstance preventing timely compliance.
        *   Even if counsel was ineffective, the individual had prior, direct knowledge of the requirement. A court or the BIA might question why the individual, having been previously instructed, did not ensure compliance or raise the issue with their retained counsel.
        *   While a client relies on counsel, their own prior knowledge could be seen as a failure of their own diligence, making it difficult to argue that counsel's ineffectiveness *alone* prevented them from acting.
    *   **Prejudice:** The prejudice prong is strong here. The failure to submit biometrics directly led to the denial of asylum and other relief without a merits hearing. This is a clear adverse outcome directly attributable to the failure to comply with a fundamental procedural requirement.
    *   **Meeting *Lozada* Requirements:** Assuming the individual can provide the necessary affidavits and notice to counsel, the core issue remains the diligence prong of equitable tolling in light of their prior knowledge.

**Conclusion on Equitable Tolling:** It is **unlikely** the individual could successfully overturn the denial of their motion to reopen based on equitable tolling. While counsel's failure was clearly deficient and prejudicial, the individual's prior instruction from the IJ about biometrics significantly weakens their argument that they acted with reasonable diligence or that counsel's ineffectiveness was the *sole* extraordinary circumstance preventing timely compliance. Courts and the BIA are generally reluctant to apply equitable tolling when an applicant had direct knowledge of the requirement.

**II. Compelling *Sua Sponte* Reopening by the BIA**

1.  **Nature of *Sua Sponte* Reopening:** The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has the discretionary authority to reopen a case *sua sponte* (on its own motion) at any time (8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(a)). This authority is reserved for ""exceptional situations"" and is not meant to cure every procedural defect or missed deadline.

2.  **Lack of Judicial Review:** Federal courts generally **lack jurisdiction to review the BIA's decision not to exercise its *sua sponte* authority.** This means an individual cannot compel the BIA to reopen their case *sua sponte*. The BIA's decision on this matter is considered purely discretionary and unreviewable.

3.  **Application to the Facts:** While the circumstances (denial of a merits hearing due to a procedural error, especially one involving biometrics, which are fundamental to the asylum process) *might* be compelling enough for the BIA to *consider* exercising its *sua sponte* authority, the individual **cannot compel** them to do so. Even if the BIA were to deny the request for *sua sponte* reopening, that denial would almost certainly not be reviewable by a federal court.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The individual faces a very difficult path.

*   **Equitable Tolling:** It is **unlikely** to succeed due to the individual's prior knowledge of the biometrics requirement, which undermines the ""diligence"" prong of equitable tolling.
*   **Compelling *Sua Sponte* Reopening:** It is **not possible** to compel the BIA to exercise its *sua sponte* authority, as such decisions are discretionary and generally not subject to judicial review.

Therefore, based on the facts provided, it is highly improbable that this individual could successfully overturn the denial of their motion to reopen or compel the BIA to *sua sponte* reopen their case.",[],,0.8167679905891418,14.436829145728645,27.001826633165848

"A group of international students had their F-1 visas terminated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after discovering they were ""enrolled"" in a sham university created by DHS as part of a sting operation. The termination letter stated their SEVIS record and Form I-20 had been set to ""Terminated due to your fraudulent enrollment."" The students filed a federal lawsuit challenging the termination, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and Due Process, and seeking an order prohibiting the Government from finding they committed fraud. The District Court dismissed the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding the DHS action was not final because reinstatement proceedings were pending and the case was not ripe for review. The students appealed. If these students were to proceed with their appeal, would the appellate court likely find that the DHS's termination of their F-1 visas constitutes a final agency action ripe for judicial review under the APA?","Yes, the appellate court would likely find that DHS's termination of the F-1 visas constitutes a final agency action ripe for judicial review under the APA. The termination order marked the consummation of the agency's decision-making process by stripping the students of their lawful status and placing a fraud notation on their records, thus determining a ""right or obligation.""

The court would disagree with the District Court's conclusions regarding finality and ripeness for two main reasons:
1.  **Finality of Agency Action:**
    *   **Reinstatement Proceedings Are Not a Prerequisite for Review:** There is no statutory or regulatory requirement for students to seek reinstatement after F-1 visa termination. Moreover, reinstatement proceedings do not provide a mechanism to review the propriety of the original termination order or the ""fraudulent enrollment"" decision. Even if reinstatement is granted, it does not ""wipe away"" the prior agency decision.
    *   **Removal Proceedings Are Not a Prerequisite for Review:** The finality of an order cannot be conditioned on potential, uninitiated removal proceedings, which may never occur. Furthermore, neither immigration judges nor the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) have the authority to review the USCIS's discretionary denial of a motion to reinstate student status or to overturn the initial termination decision. Therefore, removal proceedings do not offer an opportunity to contest the agency action. The termination is the culmination, not the initiation, of the agency's decision-making process.
2.  **Ripeness for Review:**
    *   The case is ripe because the parties are in a sufficiently adversarial posture, and the students are genuinely aggrieved by the termination of their lawful status and the permanent ""fraud"" notation on their records.

Here's why:

1.  **Separation of Powers and Executive Discretion:** The power to enforce immigration laws, including the timing and execution of deportations, rests primarily with the Executive Branch (specifically, the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, and its component agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE). Federal courts generally do not have the authority to compel an executive agency to take a specific discretionary action like immediate deportation. This would be an overreach of judicial power into executive functions.

2.  **Custody Issues:** The alien is currently in the custody of the criminal justice system (federal or state prison) to serve their sentence for murder and other felonies. ICE cannot simply ""take"" an individual from criminal custody. While ICE will typically place a ""detainer"" on such an individual, indicating their intent to take custody for deportation proceedings *after* the criminal sentence is served, the criminal justice system has primary jurisdiction over the individual until their sentence is completed or they are paroled.

3.  **No Nondiscretionary Duty:** A court might issue a writ of mandamus to compel an agency to perform a *nondiscretionary* duty (i.e., something the law *requires* them to do). However, the timing of deportation, especially for an incarcerated individual, is highly discretionary. There is no statute that mandates immediate deportation in such circumstances, overriding the criminal sentence.

4.  **Purpose of a Prior Removal Order:** A prior removal order establishes that the alien is legally removable. It does not, however, dictate the precise timing of that removal, especially when the individual is serving a lengthy criminal sentence. ICE prioritizes the removal of criminal aliens, but the actual execution of that removal typically occurs after they have completed their criminal sentence.

In summary, while the alien is clearly deportable and a high priority for removal due to their criminal convictions and the existing removal order, the timing of their deportation is an executive function. A federal district court's role is generally to review the legality of agency actions, not to dictate the day-to-day enforcement decisions of the Executive Branch, especially when it involves overriding a criminal sentence.",[],,0.8428930640220642,16.478967459324156,16.310588235294148

They are considered **""indebtedness""** and must meet specific collateralization and liability requirements to qualify as capital.

Here's a breakdown based on the regulation:

1.  **Definition of Capital (8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e)):**
    The regulation explicitly defines ""capital"" as: ""cash, equipment, inventory, other tangible property, cash equivalents, **and indebtedness secured by assets owned by the alien entrepreneur, provided that the alien entrepreneur is personally and primarily liable and that the assets of the new commercial enterprise upon which the petition is based are not subject to any claim of the creditor.**""

2.  **Why Loan Proceeds are Indebtedness, Not Just Cash:**
    *   While loan proceeds, once received by the investor, may physically be ""cash"" in their bank account, the EB-5 regulations look beyond the mere physical form to the *nature and source* of the funds.
    *   The regulation specifically includes ""indebtedness"" as a form of capital, but immediately attaches strict conditions to it. If loan proceeds were simply treated as ""cash"" without these conditions, the ""indebtedness"" clause would be redundant and easily circumvented.
    *   USCIS's intent is to ensure that the capital is truly ""at risk"" and that the investor's personal debt does not encumber the new commercial enterprise (NCE).

3.  **Requirements for Indebtedness to Qualify as Capital:**
    For loan proceeds (indebtedness) to be counted as capital for EB-5 purposes, all of the following conditions must be met:
    *   **Secured by assets owned by the alien entrepreneur:** The loan must be collateralized by assets that the investor personally owns, *not* by the assets of the NCE.
    *   **Alien entrepreneur is personally and primarily liable:** The investor must be personally responsible for repaying the loan.
    *   **Assets of the new commercial enterprise are not subject to any claim of the creditor:** The NCE's assets cannot be used as collateral for the investor's personal loan, nor can the creditor have any claim against the NCE's assets in the event of default by the investor.

**Conclusion:**

Therefore, proceeds from a loan are considered ""indebtedness"" under 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e) and must satisfy the specific collateralization and liability requirements outlined in the regulation. They cannot simply be presented as ""cash"" without demonstrating that these conditions have been met. Failure to meet these requirements will result in the borrowed funds not qualifying as capital for the EB-5 investment.",[],,0.8408781886100769,14.682833681696028,31.073826515377732

The agency properly applied FOIA Exemption 6 and satisfied its segregability obligations.","A court would likely rule against the agency's interpretation of the request and find its search inadequate. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

**1. Interpretation of the FOIA Request:**

*   **Legal Standard:** Agencies must interpret FOIA requests reasonably, not narrowly, and should not ""read into"" a request limitations that are not explicitly stated. The burden is on the agency to demonstrate that its interpretation is reasonable.
*   **Application:** The requester asked for ""records of guidelines, procedures, protocols, or policies"" related to specific practices. This language is broad and encompasses various forms of documented directives, whether formal or informal, centrally issued or locally developed.
    *   The agency's interpretation, limiting the request to ""official and centrally disseminated policies issued by its chief judicial office,"" is **unreasonably narrow**. It effectively re-writes the request to exclude a significant category of potentially responsive documents.
    *   Judicial operations, especially at the regional or individual court level, often involve local operating procedures, standing orders, or unwritten but documented protocols that guide daily practices like scheduling and continuances. These might not be ""official"" in the sense of being issued by the chief judicial office, but they are still ""guidelines, procedures, protocols, or policies"" in practice.
    *   The request did not specify ""central,"" ""official,"" or ""chief judicial office"" policies. By adding these limitations, the agency failed to interpret the request in a way that is ""reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents.""

**2. Adequacy of the Search:**

*   **Legal Standard:** An agency's search is adequate if it is ""reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant documents."" This means the agency must search in all places where responsive documents are likely to be found. The agency bears the burden of demonstrating the adequacy of its search, typically through detailed affidavits or declarations.
*   **Application:**
    *   **Flawed Premise:** Because the agency's interpretation of the request was unreasonably narrow, its search, which was based on that flawed interpretation, is **inherently inadequate**. If the agency only looked for a subset of what was requested, it necessarily failed to conduct a comprehensive search.
    *   **Failure to Search Obvious Locations:** The requester's argument that the search failed to include ""local operating procedures or policies that might be established and held by assistant chief judges or individual courts"" points to obvious locations where responsive documents would likely exist. Given that the request specifically concerned practices of ""regional courts and judges,"" it is highly probable that such courts and judges would maintain their own documented procedures, even if not centrally disseminated.
    *   **Agency's Burden:** The agency would struggle to meet its burden of demonstrating an adequate search if it can't show it looked in places where documents responsive to a *reasonable* interpretation of the request would be found. The fact that it found ""only a few documents"" further suggests the search was too limited.

**Court's Ruling:**

The court would likely:

1.  **Reject the agency's narrow interpretation** of the FOIA request, finding it unreasonable and inconsistent with the plain language of the request.
2.  **Rule that the agency's search was inadequate** because it failed to search in all locations reasonably likely to contain responsive documents, given a proper interpretation of the request.
3.  **Order the agency to conduct a new, broader search** that includes local operating procedures, policies, or guidelines established and held by assistant chief judges, individual courts, or other relevant personnel involved in the specific practices (scheduling hearings, adjudicating motions for continuance) at the regional level. The agency would need to submit new affidavits detailing the expanded search efforts.",[],,0.832114577,15.476013986013985,23.291713286713303

Kentucky* claim is substantial.

Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

**I. Legal Standard for Withdrawing a Guilty Plea Post-Sentence**

*   After sentencing, a defendant may withdraw a guilty plea only to correct a ""manifest injustice."" This is a high bar, and the defendant bears the burden of proof.
*   The court considers factors such as the timeliness of the motion, the defendant's assertion of innocence, and the prejudice to the state.

**II. Analysis of Defendant's Arguments**

**A. Limited English Proficiency (LEP) / Lack of Interpreter**

*   **Argument:** The defendant claims a limited understanding of English prevented a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary plea.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **""Order Interpreter – Swahili"" stamp:** This is a significant red flag. It suggests that at some point, the court or counsel recognized a potential language barrier. The ""unknown reasons"" for the stamp are critical; if it was for the defendant, it strongly supports the claim of LEP.
    *   **No request for interpreter:** While the defendant never requested one, this doesn't automatically negate the need. A defendant with limited English might not know to request one or might be intimidated.
    *   **Indicated understanding of immigration form:** The defendant indicated understanding when the court read the form. This is a counter-point, suggesting some level of comprehension. However, ""understanding"" a form being read aloud is different from fully comprehending complex legal concepts and the nuances of a plea agreement, especially when facing potential deportation.
    *   **Burden of Proof:** The defendant must prove that their English proficiency was so limited that they did not understand the nature of the charges, the rights being waived, or the consequences of the plea. This requires more than a mere assertion; it would likely involve testimony from the defendant, potentially an interpreter, and an assessment of their interactions with counsel and the court.
*   **Conclusion (LEP):** While the ""Order Interpreter"" stamp is concerning, the defendant's indication of understanding at the plea makes this argument challenging on its own. The court would need to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine the defendant's actual level of comprehension.

**B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (IAC) – Failure to Advise on Immigration Consequences**

*   **Argument:** Trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to adequately advise on the immigration consequences, and the defendant would have gone to trial if properly advised.
*   **Legal Standard (Strickland v. Washington):** To prove IAC, the defendant must show:
    1.  **Deficient Performance:** Counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.
    2.  **Prejudice:** There is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different (i.e., the defendant would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial).

*   **Application to Immigration Consequences (Padilla v. Kentucky):**
    *   In *Padilla v. Kentucky* (2010), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment requires criminal defense attorneys to advise non-citizen clients about the immigration consequences of a guilty plea. When the immigration consequences are ""presumptively mandatory"" (as deportation often is for an assault conviction), counsel must inform the client that conviction will lead to deportation.
    *   A first-degree misdemeanor assault is highly likely to be a deportable offense, and potentially an aggravated felony for immigration purposes, leading to mandatory deportation.

*   **Analysis (IAC):**
    1.  **Deficient Performance:**
        *   The defendant claims counsel failed to ""adequately advise."" This is key. The trial court reading a form about *potential* consequences does not absolve counsel of their independent duty under *Padilla* to provide specific, accurate, and comprehensive advice. Counsel's duty is to explain the *likelihood* and *severity* of the consequences, not just to have the client acknowledge a generic form.
        *   If counsel failed to explain that a guilty plea to first-degree misdemeanor assault would almost certainly lead to deportation, their performance was deficient under *Padilla*.
    2.  **Prejudice:**
        *   The defendant claims that if properly advised, they ""would have gone to trial."" This is the prejudice prong.
        *   Courts recognize that for many non-citizens, the immigration consequences (like deportation) are far more severe than the criminal sentence itself. Losing the right to live in the U.S. can be a devastating outcome.
        *   To establish prejudice, the defendant must credibly demonstrate that they would have rejected the plea and insisted on going to trial, even if the chances of acquittal were low, to avoid deportation. Factors considered include the strength of the government's case, the defendant's potential defenses, and the defendant's ties to the U.S.
        *   Given the severity of deportation, a credible claim that the defendant would have risked trial to avoid it often satisfies the prejudice prong.

**III. Conclusion and Recommendation**

The trial court **should grant the motion to withdraw the guilty plea** if the defendant can credibly demonstrate both prongs of the *Strickland* test regarding ineffective assistance of counsel.

*   The LEP argument, while potentially problematic, is strengthened by the ""Order Interpreter"" stamp.
*   However, the IAC claim under *Padilla* is the most compelling. If counsel failed to adequately explain the mandatory deportation consequences of the assault conviction, their performance was deficient. If the defendant can credibly assert that they would have chosen to go to trial to avoid deportation, then prejudice is established.

The court would likely need to hold an evidentiary hearing to:
1.  Determine the extent of the defendant's English proficiency at the time of the plea.
2.  Ascertain what advice (if any) trial counsel provided regarding immigration consequences.
3.  Assess the credibility of the defendant's claim that they would have gone to trial if properly advised.

Given the clear mandate of *Padilla v. Kentucky* and the severe, often mandatory, immigration consequences of an assault conviction for a non-citizen, the defendant has a strong basis for withdrawing the plea.",[],,0.8261575698852539,12.612775700262489,34.08503388946821
"A software services company, ""GlobalTech Solutions,"" had its H-1B visa petition for a ""Senior Software Engineer"" denied by USCIS on the grounds that it failed to demonstrate the position was a ""specialty occupation"" and did not provide sufficient details on job duties. GlobalTech now seeks to intervene in an ongoing lawsuit filed by another company, ""Innovate Systems,"" whose H-1B petition for a ""Project Manager IT"" was also denied by USCIS for similar reasons (failure to prove specialty occupation and employment relationship). GlobalTech argues that both cases involve common questions of law under the APA regarding USCIS's arbitrary and capricious denials.

The two companies' petitions would not share a single piece of evidence in common, and the job positions, while broadly involving computer technology, would have significantly varying specific functional responsibilities (e.g., ""Senior Software Engineer"" versus ""Project Manager IT""). Furthermore, Innovate Systems' case likely involves an additional legal question (proving an employer-employee relationship) not present in GlobalTech's case, which could prove dispositive and adds complexity.

The desire of counsel to coordinate a litigation strategy does not constitute a practical purpose that justifies intervention and would conflict with local rules for random case assignment.","The court should likely **deny** GlobalTech Solutions' motion for permissive intervention under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b).

Here's an analysis based on the requirements of FRCP 24(b):

**Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b) - Permissive Intervention:**

A court *may* permit anyone to intervene who:
1.  **Is given a conditional right to intervene by a federal statute; or** (Not applicable here)
2.  **Has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.**

In exercising its discretion, the court must consider whether the intervention will **unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties' rights.**

**Analysis:**

1.  **Timeliness:** The question states GlobalTech ""now seeks to intervene in an ongoing lawsuit,"" implying it's happening during the litigation. Assuming the motion is filed at a reasonable stage, timeliness might not be the primary hurdle, but it's always a factor for the court to consider.

2.  **Common Question of Law or Fact:**
    *   **Argument for Commonality (GlobalTech's position):** GlobalTech argues that both cases involve ""common questions of law under the APA regarding USCIS's arbitrary and capricious denials,"" specifically concerning the ""specialty occupation"" definition. Both companies are challenging USCIS's interpretation and application of the H-1B specialty occupation criteria for IT-related roles, and whether those denials meet the APA's ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard. This is a legitimate common legal question.
    *   **Argument Against Commonality (or limiting its weight):** While the *legal standard* for ""specialty occupation"" and the *standard of review* under the APA are common, the *application* of these standards is highly fact-specific.
        *   **Different Job Roles:** A ""Senior Software Engineer"" (GlobalTech) is distinct from a ""Project Manager IT"" (Innovate Systems). The specific duties, required qualifications, and industry norms for each role would be central to the ""specialty occupation"" analysis for *each individual petition*. The court would have to delve into two entirely separate factual records to determine if each specific job qualifies.
        *   **Additional Issues for Innovate Systems:** Innovate Systems' petition was also denied on the grounds of failing to prove an ""employment relationship."" This is a distinct legal and factual issue that is not present in GlobalTech's stated denial grounds. If GlobalTech intervenes, the court would be forced to adjudicate an issue (employment relationship) that is irrelevant to GlobalTech's case, adding complexity.

3.  **Undue Delay or Prejudice:** This is where GlobalTech's motion faces significant challenges.
    *   **Delay:** Adjudicating two separate H-1B petitions, each with its own unique factual record (different job duties, different companies, potentially different evidence submitted to USCIS), would almost certainly delay the resolution of Innovate Systems' original lawsuit. The court would have to review two administrative records instead of one.
    *   **Prejudice:** Innovate Systems could be prejudiced by the intervention. Its case, which includes the ""employment relationship"" issue, might become more complex and protracted by the introduction of GlobalTech's distinct factual scenario. Innovate Systems has a right to a timely adjudication of its specific claims.
    *   **Judicial Economy:** While there's a common legal thread, the significant factual differences and the additional ""employment relationship"" issue in Innovate's case mean that combining them might not actually promote judicial economy. Instead, it could lead to a more unwieldy and less efficient litigation process, essentially forcing the court to decide two separate APA challenges in one proceeding.

**Conclusion:**

While GlobalTech's motion does present a common question of law regarding the ""specialty occupation"" definition and APA review, the **significant factual differences between the two job roles, the presence of an additional, distinct legal issue (employment relationship) in Innovate Systems' case, and the high likelihood of undue delay and prejudice to the original parties** would strongly weigh against granting permissive intervention.

Courts generally exercise their discretion under Rule 24(b) cautiously, especially when the factual inquiries for the intervenor's claim would substantially diverge from the original action, even if there's some legal overlap. Therefore, the court would likely **deny** GlobalTech Solutions' motion for permissive intervention.",[],,0.8246684074401855,16.193607254814154,19.54637147335424

"After being convicted of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud and ordered to pay over $200,000 in restitution, an individual is found removable as an aggravated felon. If this individual, while detained and proceeding pro se, files a petition for review of the BIA's order 31 days after it was mailed, can they successfully challenge the use of the restitution amount to establish the aggravated felony, or argue ineffective assistance of counsel in their immigration proceedings?","No, the individual in this situation would likely not successfully challenge the use of the restitution amount to establish the aggravated felony, nor could they argue ineffective assistance of counsel in their immigration proceedings if not properly raised before the BIA.

Firstly, the court would likely have jurisdiction to hear the petition for review, despite it being received 31 days after the BIA order was mailed, because the ""prison mailbox rule"" (Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 25(a)(2)(A)(iii)) applies to pro se detainees in immigration proceedings. This rule deems a filing timely if it is deposited in the institution's internal mail system on or before the last day for filing, with a compliant certificate of service or evidence of deposit.

Secondly, regarding the aggravated felony determination, a restitution order tied to a fraud conspiracy conviction, clearly showing a loss to victims exceeding $10,000, provides clear and convincing evidence to establish that the conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M). The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) is permitted to rely on such sentencing-related material to determine the amount of loss, and the individual's restitution order for $229,717.30 linked to their conviction would be sufficient evidence.

Finally, any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel concerning immigration proceedings cannot be considered by the court if the individual failed to first raise it before the BIA on direct appeal or in a motion to reopen.

Additionally, other unreasoned and unsupported claims would likely be considered abandoned.","Based on the information provided, the individual will likely **not** be able to successfully challenge either the use of the restitution amount or argue ineffective assistance of counsel in this specific petition for review. Here's why:

1.  **Timeliness of the Petition for Review (Fatal Flaw):**
    *   **Statutory Requirement:** Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(1), a petition for review of a final order of removal must be filed ""not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.""
    *   **Application:** The individual filed their petition 31 days after the BIA's order was mailed. This means the petition was filed one day late.
    *   **Consequence:** The 30-day deadline is a **jurisdictional bar**. Federal circuit courts have consistently held that an untimely petition for review deprives the court of jurisdiction to hear the case. This means the court cannot even consider the merits of any arguments raised, regardless of their potential validity. The fact that the individual is detained and proceeding pro se generally does not excuse a failure to meet this strict statutory deadline, although the ""prison mailbox rule"" might apply to determine the filing date if the petition was given to prison authorities within the 30 days, but here it states it was *filed* 31 days after mailing.

Assuming, for the sake of completeness, that the petition *had* been timely filed, here's how the other arguments would likely fare:

2.  **Challenge to the Use of Restitution Amount to Establish Aggravated Felony:**
    *   **Aggravated Felony Definition:** For offenses involving fraud or deceit, an aggravated felony is defined, in part, as an offense ""in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000."" (INA § 101(a)(43)(M)(i)).
    *   **Judicial Precedent:** Courts routinely hold that a restitution order, particularly one entered as part of the judgment of conviction, is strong evidence of the ""loss"" amount for aggravated felony purposes. The fact that the restitution was ""over $200,000"" far exceeds the $10,000 threshold.
    *   **Likely Outcome (if timely):** A challenge based solely on the use of the restitution amount to establish the aggravated felony would likely **fail on the merits**. Courts generally accept restitution orders as reliable indicators of loss for these purposes, especially when the conviction is for offenses like bank and wire fraud, which directly involve financial loss.

3.  **Argument of Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (IAC) in Immigration Proceedings:**
    *   **Procedural Requirement:** Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel generally cannot be raised for the first time in a petition for review before a federal circuit court. The proper procedure for raising an IAC claim is to file a **motion to reopen** with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) (or the Immigration Judge, depending on where the alleged ineffectiveness occurred).
    *   **Rationale:** This allows for the development of a factual record, including affidavits from the former counsel, the respondent, and any other relevant parties, which is necessary to properly adjudicate an IAC claim under the standards set forth in *Matter of Lozada* and *Matter of Compean*. Federal circuit courts are appellate bodies and do not engage in fact-finding.
    *   **Likely Outcome (if timely):** Even if the petition were timely, the court would almost certainly **decline to hear the IAC claim** because it was not properly exhausted through the administrative process. The court would likely dismiss this portion of the petition without prejudice, advising the individual to pursue it through a motion to reopen with the BIA.

**Conclusion:**

The individual's petition for review is untimely, which is a jurisdictional defect. Therefore, the federal circuit court will almost certainly dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction, meaning it will not reach the merits of either the aggravated felony challenge or the ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Even if the petition had been timely, the challenge to the restitution amount would likely fail on the merits, and the IAC claim would be procedurally improper for a first-time review in the circuit court.",[],,0.8426175713539124,14.983306750392465,33.02240753532183

Here's why:

1.  **The REAL ID Act of 2005:** This act significantly curtailed federal district court jurisdiction over immigration matters. Specifically, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5) states that ""a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal entered or issued under any provision of this Act.""
2.  **Broad Scope of Preclusion:** The Supreme Court and various Circuit Courts have interpreted this preclusion broadly. Section 1252(b)(9) further clarifies that ""all questions of law and fact, including interpretations and applications of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States"" are subject to review *only* by the courts of appeals.
3.  **""Arising from"" Removal Proceedings:** An adjustment-of-status application, particularly when an alien is already subject to an outstanding order of removal, is considered a form of relief from removal. A challenge to USCIS's denial of jurisdiction over such an application, even if framed as an APA challenge to agency authority, is deemed to ""arise from"" or be ""related to"" the removal proceedings. The agency's determination of its own jurisdiction in this context is intertwined with the alien's eligibility for relief from removal.
4.  **Purpose of the Act:** The intent of the REAL ID Act was to streamline judicial review of removal orders and related decisions, centralizing it in the Courts of Appeals and preventing piecemeal litigation in district courts.

Therefore, the proper forum for challenging USCIS's denial of jurisdiction in this scenario would be the **U.S. Court of Appeals**, typically as part of a petition for review of the final order of removal or a related decision. The district court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction due to the jurisdictional stripping provisions of the INA, as amended by the REAL ID Act.",[],,0.8780360817909241,15.636432700247727,26.97601156069365

1.  **Grant a Preliminary Injunction:** This is the most probable outcome given the facts. To grant a preliminary injunction, the court typically considers four factors:
    *   **Likelihood of Success on the Merits:** The applicant has an extremely strong likelihood of success. The USCIS denial was based on a policy that a federal court has since invalidated. This means the denial was likely arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).
    *   **Irreparable Harm:** The applicant would likely suffer irreparable harm without the injunction. This could include loss of a job opportunity, loss of income, potential forced departure from the U.S. (if already present), disruption to career and life plans, and the inability to obtain an adequate remedy through monetary damages.
    *   **Balance of Hardships:** The hardship to the applicant (loss of job, status, etc.) significantly outweighs the hardship to the government, which would merely be required to re-adjudicate the petition under the correct legal standard.
    *   **Public Interest:** The public interest favors upholding the rule of law, ensuring government agencies act within their legal authority, and preventing arbitrary denials based on invalid policies.

2.  **Specific Orders within the Preliminary Injunction:**

    *   **Enjoin USCIS from enforcing the denial:** The court would likely prevent USCIS from acting on the previous denial that was based on the invalidated policy.
    *   **Order USCIS to Re-adjudicate the H-1B Petition:** The court would typically *not* grant the H-1B petition itself, as that is an administrative function. Instead, it would order USCIS to re-adjudicate the petition *without applying the invalidated policy*. USCIS would then have to review the petition based on all other valid H-1B requirements.
    *   **Maintain Applicant's Immigration Status (if applicable):** If the applicant is currently in the U.S. (e.g., on another visa status, or if the H-1B was a change of status petition), the court would likely include a provision to maintain their current immigration status and work authorization (if any) while USCIS re-adjudicates the petition. This prevents the applicant from being forced to leave the country or lose their ability to work due to an unlawful denial.
    *   **Set a Deadline for Re-adjudication:** The court might impose a reasonable deadline for USCIS to complete the re-adjudication process.

In essence, the District Court would intervene to correct an agency action based on an unlawful policy, ensuring the applicant receives a fair adjudication of their H-1B petition under the correct legal framework, and protecting their status in the interim.",[],,0.8287004232406616,14.437264705882352,29.403191176470614
"A Christian leader from El Salvador, Samuel Argueta-Hernandez, was repeatedly threatened by MS-13 gang members after he refused to pay extortion and collaborate with them, with later threats explicitly mentioning his religious leadership. An assassin attempted to kill his son, and Salvadoran authorities, while acknowledging his danger, told him they could not protect him and even asked him to sign a liability waiver if he remained in the country. If the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denies his applications for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), stating that the harm was not severe enough due to lack of physical injury, that the nexus to his religion was insufficient as the gang's primary motive was extortion, and that the government's temporary safe house and facilitated departure demonstrated a willingness to protect him, how should a U.S. Court of Appeals review this decision?","The U.S. Court of Appeals should grant the petition for review, reverse the BIA's decision, and remand for further proceedings.

1.  **Questions of Law:** Reviewed *de novo* (without deference to the BIA's interpretation). This includes the interpretation of statutory provisions and regulations.
2.  **Factual Findings:** Reviewed under the *substantial evidence* standard. The BIA's factual findings must be supported by ""reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole."" The court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the BIA simply because it would have reached a different conclusion.
3.  **Mixed Questions of Law and Fact:** Often reviewed *de novo* for the legal component and *substantial evidence* for the factual component.

Applying these standards to the BIA's denial of Samuel Argueta-Hernandez's applications:

**I. Withholding of Removal (INA § 241(b)(3))**

To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate that his life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. This requires showing a ""clear probability"" (more likely than not) of persecution.

*   **BIA Finding 1: Harm not severe enough due to lack of physical injury.**
    *   **Court of Appeals Review:** This is primarily a question of law regarding the definition of ""persecution"" and a factual finding regarding the severity of harm.
    *   **Analysis:** Persecution does *not* require physical injury. Severe threats, psychological harm, economic deprivation, and the attempted murder of a family member can constitute persecution. The BIA's implicit or explicit requirement of physical injury would likely be an error of law, reviewable *de novo*. Furthermore, given the facts (repeated threats, explicit mention of religious leadership, attempted assassination of his son), a finding that the harm was *not severe enough* would likely lack *substantial evidence*. The attempted murder of a child is an extremely severe act.

*   **BIA Finding 2: Nexus to his religion was insufficient as the gang's primary motive was extortion.**
    *   **Court of Appeals Review:** This involves a legal interpretation of the ""on account of"" (nexus) requirement and a factual finding about the gang's motives.
    *   **Analysis:** U.S. law recognizes that persecutors can have mixed motives. If a protected ground (like religion) is *one central reason* for the persecution, the nexus requirement can be met, even if other motives (like extortion) are also present. The BIA's focus on ""primary motive"" might be a misapplication of the legal standard, reviewable *de novo*. The prompt explicitly states that later threats *explicitly mentioned his religious leadership*. This fact strongly suggests that religion became a central reason for the threats, even if extortion was an initial or concurrent motive. A factual finding that there was *no* nexus to religion, despite the explicit mention of his religious leadership, would likely lack *substantial evidence*.

*   **BIA Finding 3: The government's temporary safe house and facilitated departure demonstrated a willingness to protect him.**
    *   **Court of Appeals Review:** This is a factual finding regarding the Salvadoran government's ability and willingness to protect.
    *   **Analysis:** For withholding of removal, the applicant must show the government is *unable or unwilling* to protect them. The facts state that Salvadoran authorities *acknowledged his danger*, *told him they could not protect him*, and *asked him to sign a liability waiver if he remained*. A ""temporary safe house"" followed by ""facilitated departure"" (i.e., ""get out of the country"") is not protection in the sense of allowing him to live safely in his home country. In fact, asking him to leave and sign a liability waiver is strong evidence of the government's *inability* to protect him. Therefore, the BIA's finding that this demonstrated a *willingness to protect* him (in a way that negates his claim) would likely lack *substantial evidence* and mischaracterize the facts.

**II. Protection Under the Convention Against Torture (CAT)**

To qualify for CAT protection, an applicant must show it is ""more likely than not"" that he would be tortured if removed to the country of removal. Torture is defined as severe pain or suffering inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.

*   **BIA Findings 1 & 3 (Severity of Harm & Government Protection):**
    *   **Court of Appeals Review:** Similar to withholding of removal, the BIA's finding that the harm was not severe enough (especially given the attempted assassination of his son) would likely lack *substantial evidence*. The BIA's mischaracterization of the Salvadoran government's actions as ""willingness to protect"" would also likely lack *substantial evidence*, as the government explicitly stated it could not protect him and asked him to leave.
    *   **Analysis:** The key distinction for CAT is the ""state action"" requirement (by or with the acquiescence of a public official). While MS-13 is a non-state actor, the Salvadoran government's explicit acknowledgment of danger, inability to protect, and request for a liability waiver could be interpreted as *acquiescence* to the torture, especially if they are aware of the threats and do nothing effective to stop them. The BIA's findings on severity and government protection would be reviewed for substantial evidence, and given the facts, they appear to be unsupported.

**Conclusion:**

A U.S. Court of Appeals reviewing this BIA decision would likely find several errors:

1.  **Legal Error (De Novo Review):** The BIA's potential requirement of physical injury for ""persecution"" or ""severe harm"" and its ""primary motive"" test for nexus would likely be found to be errors of law.
2.  **Lack of Substantial Evidence (Factual Review):** The BIA's factual findings that the harm was not severe enough, that there was no religious nexus, and that the Salvadoran government demonstrated a willingness to protect him appear to be unsupported by the record, given the explicit facts provided (attempted assassination of son, explicit mention of religious leadership, government's admission of inability to protect and request for liability waiver).

Therefore, the Court of Appeals would likely **grant the petition for review, vacate the BIA's decision, and remand the case** for further proceedings consistent with the correct legal standards and a proper assessment of the evidence.",[],,0.8094961047172546,14.333519785378943,31.641135926671183
Can a U.S. federal court compel USCIS to reverse its discretionary denial of an employment authorization application (Form I-765) and approve it during the pendency of judicial review?,"No, a U.S. federal court cannot compel USCIS to reverse its discretionary denial of an employment authorization application (Form I-765) and approve it during the pendency of judicial review.

Here's a breakdown of why:

1.  **Judicial Review of Discretionary Decisions:**
    *   Federal courts review agency actions under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). For discretionary decisions like EAD denials, the standard of review is typically whether the agency's decision was ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.""
    *   This means the court examines whether USCIS followed proper procedures, considered all relevant factors, and provided a reasoned explanation for its decision. The court does *not* substitute its own judgment for that of the agency.

2.  **Remand, Not Compel Approval:**
    *   If a federal court finds that USCIS abused its discretion, acted arbitrarily, or made a legal error in denying the EAD, the most common remedy is to **remand** the case back to USCIS.
    *   A remand instructs USCIS to reconsider the application, correct its errors, or provide a more reasoned explanation. It does *not* typically order USCIS to approve the application. The agency retains its discretion to make a new decision, even if that decision is another denial (provided it's now legally sound and well-reasoned).
    *   Courts are generally very reluctant to step into the shoes of an administrative agency and compel a specific substantive outcome, especially when that outcome involves the exercise of discretion. Doing so would violate the principle of separation of powers.

3.  **""During the Pendency of Judicial Review"" (Interim Relief):**
    *   This refers to preliminary injunctions or temporary restraining orders. To obtain such relief, a plaintiff must typically demonstrate:
        *   A substantial likelihood of success on the merits.
        *   Irreparable harm in the absence of the injunction.
        *   That the balance of equities favors the plaintiff.
        *   That the injunction is in the public interest.
    *   **Likelihood of Success:** Proving a ""substantial likelihood of success on the merits"" to compel *approval* of a discretionary benefit is an extremely high bar. It would require showing that USCIS had *no lawful basis whatsoever* to deny the application and that approval was the *only* possible outcome under the law. This is almost never the case for a discretionary denial.
    *   **Irreparable Harm:** While loss of employment and income can be significant, courts often find that such economic harm, while serious, is not ""irreparable"" in the legal sense, as it can theoretically be compensated later.

**In very rare and exceptional circumstances,** where an agency's discretion is so narrowly circumscribed that only one outcome is legally permissible, or where the agency has engaged in a pattern of egregious misconduct, a court *might* theoretically compel approval. However, for a standard discretionary denial of an EAD, this is an extremely remote possibility. The practical reality is that a successful challenge will result in a remand for reconsideration.",[],,0.8351925611495972,13.936042553191491,28.63300000000001
"Under what circumstances does a U.S. Court of Appeals lack jurisdiction to review a Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision to deny cancellation of removal, and what procedural requirements must an alien meet to challenge BIA procedural errors on appeal?","The U.S. Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction to review a BIA's purely discretionary decision to deny cancellation of removal, even if the alien is statutorily eligible, because Congress expressly stripped jurisdiction over ""any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section . . . 1229b"" by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i).

Here's a breakdown of the arguments:

1.  **Lack of Jurisdiction Due to NTA Not Filed:**
    *   **The Argument:** The alien argues the immigration court lacked jurisdiction because the Notice to Appear (NTA) was not filed.
    *   **Legal Principle:** The filing of the NTA with the immigration court is what vests the immigration court with jurisdiction over the removal proceedings. While the Supreme Court's decisions in *Pereira v. Sessions* and *Niz-Chavez v. Garland* primarily addressed the ""stop-time rule"" for cancellation of removal and the requirement for an NTA to specify the time and date of the initial hearing, they did not fundamentally alter the principle that the *filing* of the NTA with the court is necessary to establish jurisdiction.
    *   **Application:** If the NTA was *never* filed with the immigration court, then the court never acquired jurisdiction over the alien's case. An order of removal issued by a court lacking jurisdiction is void. This is a fundamental defect. If the NTA was merely ""defective"" (e.g., missing time/date) but *was* filed, jurisdiction would still vest, but the lack of specific notice would be a due process issue. However, the claim here is that it ""was not filed,"" which is a more severe jurisdictional challenge.

2.  **Improper Reliance on Reconstructed Record (Form I-213) to Prove Notice:**
    *   **The Argument:** The BIA improperly relied on a reconstructed record containing a Form I-213 instead of the NTA to prove notice.
    *   **Legal Principle:** For an in absentia order to be valid, the government must prove by clear and convincing evidence that written notice of the time and place of the hearing was provided to the alien. Due process requires notice reasonably calculated to apprise the alien of the proceedings.
    *   **Application:** A Form I-213 (Record of Deportable/Inadmissible Alien) is an internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) document. While it might record that an NTA was served or that an alien was advised of certain rights, it is generally *not* sufficient, by itself, to prove that the alien received *written notice of a specific hearing's time and place*. It is not a substitute for the NTA itself or a separate hearing notice. Relying on an I-213 to prove that the alien received written notice of the hearing for which they failed to appear is highly problematic and likely an abuse of discretion by the BIA, as it does not directly establish that the alien received the required statutory and due process notice.

3.  **Due Process Violation Due to Lack of Written Notice:**
    *   **The Argument:** The alien's due process rights were violated due to lack of written notice of the hearing.
    *   **Legal Principle:** The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, as well as specific statutory provisions in the INA, require that an alien receive written notice of the time and place of their removal hearing. Without such notice, an in absentia order cannot stand.
    *   **Application:** This argument is directly linked to the previous point. If the BIA improperly relied on the I-213 and there is no other clear and convincing evidence in the record that the alien received proper written notice of the hearing, then the in absentia order was issued in violation of the alien's due process rights. The government bears the burden of proving such notice.

**Conclusion:**

The federal appellate court should likely grant the petition to review and reverse the denial of the motion to reopen for several reasons:

*   **Jurisdictional Challenge:** If the NTA was truly never filed, the immigration court lacked jurisdiction, rendering the removal order void. This is a fundamental legal error.
*   **Insufficient Proof of Notice:** The BIA's reliance on a Form I-213 to prove that the alien received written notice of the hearing is likely an abuse of discretion. An I-213 is not direct proof of service of a hearing notice and does not satisfy the government's burden to show clear and convincing evidence of proper notice.
*   **Due Process Violation:** Without proper written notice of the hearing, the in absentia order violates the alien's due process rights.

An appellate court reviews the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, but it reviews underlying legal questions (like jurisdiction and due process) *de novo*. An error of law or a decision based on an incorrect legal premise (such as what constitutes sufficient proof of notice) constitutes an abuse of discretion. Given the strong arguments regarding jurisdiction and the lack of proper notice, the appellate court would likely find that the BIA erred.",[],,0.8218553066253662,12.671570829124253,43.869612829279674

Therefore, the petition for review was denied.","This is a complex scenario with a mixed outcome, leaning towards the immigrant *not* successfully rescinding the *in absentia* order, primarily due to their own error in providing the address.

Here's a breakdown of the arguments and their likely success:

**1. Argument: Did not receive proper notice due to the single-letter typo in the mailing address.**

*   **Likely Outcome: Unsuccessful.**
*   **Reasoning:** Immigrants have a statutory duty under INA § 240(b)(5)(A) and 8 C.F.R. § 1003.15(d)(2) to provide the immigration court with a current and accurate mailing address and to notify the court of any change of address using Form EOIR-33.
    *   The government fulfilled its duty by sending the hearing notice to the address *provided by the immigrant*.
    *   The fact that the notice was returned undeliverable to the address on file actually strengthens the government's position that they attempted to provide notice.
    *   The typo, being the immigrant's own error, would almost certainly not be considered ""reasonable cause"" for failure to appear, which is the standard for rescinding an *in absentia* order under INA § 240(b)(5)(C). Courts generally hold individuals responsible for their own administrative errors, especially regarding critical contact information.

**2. Argument: The original NTA was defective for lacking the hearing date or time.**

*   **Likely Outcome: Mixed, but still challenging for the immigrant.**
*   **Reasoning:** This argument hinges on the Supreme Court cases *Pereira v. Sessions* (2018) and *Niz-Chavez v. Garland* (2021), which held that an NTA that does not specify the time and place of the initial hearing is not a ""notice to appear"" for purposes of the ""stop-time rule"" in cancellation of removal cases.
    *   **The BIA's Stance (*Matter of Mendoza-Hernandez*, 2019):** The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has held that *Pereira* does *not* apply to the notice requirements for *in absentia* orders. The BIA maintains that a subsequent hearing notice (like a Form I-862 or I-189), even if it's the first document to contain the date and time, can ""cure"" a defective NTA for *in absentia* purposes. Under this view, the original NTA's defect wouldn't prevent an *in absentia* order if a subsequent notice was sent.
    *   **Circuit Split:** Some federal circuit courts of appeals (e.g., the Ninth Circuit in *K.O. v. Garland*, 2022) have disagreed with the BIA, holding that *Pereira* and *Niz-Chavez* *do* apply to *in absentia* orders. These circuits reason that if the initial NTA is fundamentally defective for lacking the time and place, it cannot serve as the basis for an *in absentia* order, even if a subsequent notice was sent.
    *   **Application to this case:**
        *   If the case is heard in a jurisdiction that follows the BIA's *Mendoza-Hernandez* precedent, the argument about the defective NTA would likely fail. The government would argue that the subsequent hearing notice (even if not received due to the typo) cured the NTA's defect.
        *   If the case is heard in a circuit that rejects *Mendoza-Hernandez* and applies *Pereira/Niz-Chavez* to *in absentia* orders, the argument about the defective NTA would have more weight. The immigrant could argue that the court never gained proper jurisdiction to issue an *in absentia* order because the initial NTA was not a ""notice to appear"" as required by statute.

**Overall Conclusion:**

While the argument regarding the defective NTA has some legal traction in certain jurisdictions due to the circuit split, the immigrant's primary hurdle is the **self-inflicted error of providing an incorrect mailing address.**

Even in a circuit that might agree the NTA was defective, the fact that the subsequent hearing notice was sent to the address *provided by the immigrant* (albeit with a typo) significantly weakens their claim of ""lack of proper notice"" or ""reasonable cause."" The government can argue they fulfilled their duty by sending the notice to the address on file, and the non-receipt was due to the immigrant's own negligence.

Therefore, it is **highly unlikely** the immigrant would successfully argue to rescind the *in absentia* removal order and reopen proceedings. The typo in the address, which is the immigrant's responsibility, is a critical flaw in their argument for ""reasonable cause"" for non-appearance. While the NTA defect argument is stronger, it's often overshadowed by the failure to maintain a correct address.",[],,0.8393967151641846,12.567329545454548,42.92099431818184
"An asylum applicant from Cameroon, whose testimony about persecution (arrest, torture, protest involvement) is deemed credible by an Immigration Judge (I.J.), has their application for asylum and withholding of removal denied due to insufficient corroborating evidence. The I.J. finds that affidavits submitted by family and friends lack personal knowledge of the events and that other forms of corroboration (like medical evidence of injuries) were not provided despite being reasonably available. The applicant argues that the I.J. erred by not following the procedures outlined in *Matter of L-A-C-*, which require an I.J. to first identify specific corroborating evidence, then give the applicant an opportunity to explain its absence, and finally state whether that explanation is sufficient. Did the I.J.'s actions in this case violate the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures?","No, the Immigration Judge's actions did not violate the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures in this case.

The I.J. specifically found the affidavits submitted by the applicant's wife, uncle, neighbor, and family lawyer insufficient because the affiants lacked personal knowledge of the recounted events. Other evidence, such as the applicant's injured foot and general country reports or newspaper articles, was deemed insufficient to compel a conclusion contrary to the I.J.'s finding of insufficient corroboration.

The CAT claim was also denied for the same reason—lack of sufficient corroborating evidence.","Yes, the I.J.'s actions in this case likely violated the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures.

Here's why:

1.  **The Purpose of *Matter of L-A-C-***: This precedent decision (and subsequent case law like *Matter of J-Y-C-*) establishes a specific three-step process that an Immigration Judge must follow when denying an asylum claim based on a lack of corroborating evidence, *especially when the applicant's testimony has been deemed credible*. The purpose is to ensure due process and prevent ""gotcha"" denials where an applicant isn't given a fair chance to address the perceived evidentiary gaps.

2.  **The Three Steps of *Matter of L-A-C-***:
    *   **Step 1: Identify Specific Corroborating Evidence:** The I.J. must identify specific, reasonably available corroborating evidence that the applicant has not provided.
    *   **Step 2: Opportunity to Explain:** The I.J. must give the applicant an opportunity to explain the absence of that specific corroborating evidence.
    *   **Step 3: Sufficiency Determination:** The I.J. must then determine whether the applicant's explanation for the absence of the evidence is sufficient.

3.  **Applying to the Case Facts:**
    *   **Credibility:** The I.J. *deemed the applicant's testimony credible*. This is a critical point, as *L-A-C-* is most relevant when credibility is not at issue, but corroboration is.
    *   **Step 1 Met (Partially):** The I.J. *did* identify a specific type of missing corroboration: ""medical evidence of injuries."" The I.J. also found this evidence to be ""reasonably available."" This satisfies the first step for that particular type of evidence. Regarding the affidavits, the I.J. found them lacking in ""personal knowledge,"" which is a finding about their *quality* rather than their *absence*. While an I.J. can certainly find submitted evidence insufficient, if the I.J. believed *other, better* affidavits (e.g., from direct witnesses) were reasonably available, then the *L-A-C-* framework would apply to their absence.
    *   **Step 2 Violated:** The facts state that the I.J. ""found that... other forms of corroboration (like medical evidence of injuries) were not provided despite being reasonably available."" The crucial missing element here is that the I.J. *did not give the applicant an opportunity to explain the absence* of this medical evidence. The I.J simply made a finding that it was missing and reasonably available.
    *   **Step 3 Violated:** Since the applicant was not given an opportunity to explain, the I.J. could not have made a determination about the sufficiency of any explanation.

**Conclusion:**

The I.J.'s actions violated the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures because, after identifying specific, reasonably available corroborating evidence (medical evidence of injuries) that was not provided, the I.J. failed to give the applicant an opportunity to explain its absence before denying the application on that basis. This omission directly contravenes the procedural safeguards established by *Matter of L-A-C-*.",[],,0.8438215255737305,11.274133072407047,36.522041095890444

Here's a breakdown of the likely grounds for resolving his various claims:

1.  **Asylum and Withholding of Removal:**
    *   **Outcome:** The Fifth Circuit would most likely **affirm the BIA's denial** of asylum and withholding of removal.
    *   **Grounds:**
        *   **Substantial Evidence:** The court would review the BIA's factual findings (e.g., regarding credibility, past persecution, well-founded fear of future persecution, or nexus to a protected ground) under the ""substantial evidence"" standard. This means the BIA's findings must be upheld unless the evidence ""compels a contrary conclusion"" – a very high bar for the petitioner to meet.
        *   **Failure to Meet Burden of Proof:** Kumar likely failed to establish that he suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground (race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion) for asylum. For withholding of removal, the burden is even higher, requiring a showing that it is ""more likely than not"" he would be persecuted. If asylum fails, withholding almost invariably fails as well.
        *   **Lack of Nexus:** The BIA may have found that any harm Kumar experienced or feared was not ""on account of"" a protected ground, but rather due to generalized violence, economic hardship, or personal disputes.

2.  **Protection Under the Convention Against Torture (CAT):**
    *   **Outcome:** The Fifth Circuit would most likely **affirm the BIA's denial** of CAT protection.
    *   **Grounds:**
        *   **""More Likely Than Not"" Standard:** For CAT, Kumar needed to show it was ""more likely than not"" that he would be tortured if removed to India. This is a different standard than persecution and focuses on the nature of the harm (torture) and the involvement of government officials (by or with the acquiescence of a public official).
        *   **Insufficient Evidence of Torture or State Acquiescence:** Kumar likely failed to present sufficient evidence to meet this high standard, either regarding the likelihood of torture itself or the necessary government involvement/acquiescence.

3.  **Denial of Motion to Remand:**
    *   **Outcome:** The Fifth Circuit would most likely **affirm the BIA's denial** of the motion to remand.
    *   **Grounds:**
        *   **Abuse of Discretion:** The BIA's decision to deny a motion to remand is reviewed for ""abuse of discretion,"" which is an extremely deferential standard.
        *   **Failure to Meet Requirements:** Kumar likely failed to demonstrate that the new evidence he sought to present was material, was previously unavailable, and would likely change the outcome of the case. The BIA has broad discretion in determining whether to grant a remand.

4.  **Allegations of Substantive and Procedural Errors:**
    *   **Outcome:** The Fifth Circuit would likely find that the alleged errors **did not rise to the level of reversible error.**
    *   **Grounds:**
        *   **Substantive Errors:** If Kumar alleged the BIA misapplied the law, the court would review this *de novo* (without deference), but often gives *Chevron* deference to the agency's interpretation of ambiguous statutes. If the BIA's application of the law was reasonable, it would be upheld. If the alleged error related to factual findings, it would fall under the substantial evidence standard discussed above.
        *   **Procedural Errors:** Allegations of procedural errors (e.g., due process violations) would be reviewed *de novo*. However, to succeed, Kumar would need to show a significant error that prejudiced his case, such as being denied a fair hearing or the opportunity to present evidence. Minor procedural irregularities are typically not enough to warrant reversal.

In summary, without specific details of the case, the most common outcome in the Fifth Circuit for such petitions is an affirmation of the BIA's decision, primarily due to the high burden of proof on the petitioner and the deferential standards of review applied to the agency's factual findings and discretionary decisions.",[],,0.8320258855819702,14.620808080808086,33.05127489585118

The petition for review is granted, and the case is remanded for further consideration of the CAT deferral claim consistent with the opinion.","This scenario presents two distinct legal questions: mootness of the appeal and potential agency error in denying CAT deferral.

**1. Does the individual's removal moot his appeal?**

**No, the individual's removal to El Salvador while his appeal of a CAT denial was pending likely does not moot his appeal.**

*   **General Rule:** Generally, an appeal of a removal order is mooted once the individual has been removed, as the court can no longer provide the requested relief (preventing removal).
*   **CAT Exception:** However, many federal circuit courts (including the Second, Third, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits) have held that an appeal of a denial of CAT relief is *not* mooted by the petitioner's removal to the country where they fear torture.
    *   **Rationale:** The relief sought under CAT is protection from torture, not merely prevention of removal. If the petitioner is removed to the country where they claim they will be tortured, the harm they sought to prevent is now imminent or ongoing. A court can still provide meaningful relief by:
        *   Vacating the agency's denial of CAT relief.
        *   Remanding the case to the agency for a new determination.
        *   If CAT relief is ultimately granted, the government would then be obligated to take steps to facilitate the individual's return or provide protection, even if complex. The government's obligation under CAT is not just to refrain from removing, but to refrain from *returning* an individual to torture.
    *   **Distinction:** While the *removal order itself* might be mooted, the *denial of CAT protection* remains a live controversy, as the individual is now in the very place they fear torture, and the government's obligations under CAT are ongoing.

**2. Did the agency err in denying CAT deferral?**

**Yes, the agency likely erred in denying CAT deferral, specifically due to the IJ's failure to address the affidavits in the likelihood-of-torture assessment, which the BIA then adopted.**

*   **CAT Standard:** To qualify for deferral of removal under CAT, an applicant must establish that it is ""more likely than not"" (i.e., a probability greater than 50%) that they would be tortured if removed to the country in question. This is a high evidentiary standard.
*   **Agency's Findings and Potential Errors:**
    *   **Adverse Credibility Determination:** An adverse credibility finding is a significant hurdle. If the IJ's adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence, it would severely weaken the petitioner's own testimony regarding his fear of torture. Courts generally defer to such findings.
    *   **General Country Conditions:** The IJ's finding that general country conditions were insufficient is also a common reason for denial. While general conditions alone are rarely enough, they provide crucial context for individual claims.
    *   **Failure to Address Specific Evidence (Affidavits):** This is the most significant potential error. The IJ explicitly ""did not mention the affidavits in the likelihood-of-torture assessment.""
        *   **Duty to Consider All Evidence:** Immigration judges and the BIA have a duty to consider all relevant evidence presented by an applicant.
        *   **Relevance of Affidavits:** The affidavits detailing a 2023 incident where police searched for the individual at his father's home are highly specific, recent, and directly relevant to his claim that the Salvadoran government would target him as a suspected gang member. This evidence, if credible, could corroborate his fear and demonstrate a specific threat beyond general country conditions.
        *   **Impact of Omission:** Even with an adverse credibility finding against the applicant's own testimony, independent documentary evidence (like credible affidavits from others) must be evaluated on its own merits. The IJ's failure to discuss or analyze this specific evidence in the context of the ""more likely than not"" standard suggests an incomplete and potentially arbitrary assessment of the CAT claim.
        *   **BIA Adoption:** By adopting the IJ's decision without addressing this omission, the BIA perpetuated the error.
*   **Conclusion on Agency Error:** The IJ's failure to consider and discuss the specific, recent affidavits in its likelihood-of-torture assessment constitutes a potential legal error or abuse of discretion. A reviewing court would likely find that the agency failed to adequately consider all relevant evidence, requiring a remand for a proper assessment of the CAT claim.",[],,0.817385733,14.4259741,28.70490709459463
"An individual holding an H-4 visa and employment authorization has applied for renewal, but after more than seven months, the applications remain unprocessed.

"A non-profit organization, ""Immigrant Rights Advocates,"" provides pro bono legal services to low-income immigrants. The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) recently finalized a rule significantly increasing fees for various immigration filings, including appeals to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and applications for cancellation of removal. Immigrant Rights Advocates argues that these increased fees will severely limit their ability to provide legal representation, forcing them to take on fewer clients and divert resources to fee waiver applications.

Here's a breakdown of the potential arguments and challenges:

**I. Grounds for Challenge under the APA (5 U.S.C. § 706(2))**

The most likely and strongest ground for IRA's challenge would be that EOIR's rule is **arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law** (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)).

To succeed on this claim, IRA would need to demonstrate that EOIR:

1.  **Failed to Consider Important Aspects of the Problem:** IRA's core argument is that EOIR ""failed to adequately consider these impacts."" This directly aligns with the arbitrary and capricious standard, which requires an agency to ""examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made."" (See *Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co.*).
    *   **Specifics:** IRA would argue that EOIR did not adequately consider:
        *   The severe impact on access to justice for low-income immigrants, who often cannot navigate complex immigration law without legal aid.
        *   The disproportionate burden on non-profit legal service providers like IRA, forcing them to divert resources from direct representation to administrative tasks (fee waiver applications) or reduce client intake.
        *   The potential for these fees to effectively bar access to statutory remedies (like cancellation of removal) or appellate review (BIA appeals) for indigent individuals, thereby undermining the intent of Congress in creating those processes.
        *   Whether the fee waiver process is truly sufficient to mitigate these harms, or if it itself creates an additional, significant administrative burden.

2.  **Failed to Respond to Significant Public Comments:** During the notice-and-comment rulemaking process, IRA and similar organizations likely submitted comments detailing these exact concerns. EOIR is required to consider and respond to significant comments. If EOIR simply ignored these concerns or provided a perfunctory response without a reasoned explanation for why they were rejected or deemed insufficient, this could be a basis for an arbitrary and capricious finding.

3.  **Lack of a Reasoned Explanation:** Even if EOIR acknowledged the concerns, if their justification for proceeding with the fee increases despite these foreseeable negative impacts is deemed irrational, unsupported by evidence, or inconsistent with the administrative record, a court could find the rule arbitrary and capricious. For example, if EOIR's stated purpose for the fees (e.g., cost recovery) is not rationally connected to the chosen fee amounts, or if less burdensome alternatives were not adequately considered.

**II. Other Potential, but Less Likely, Grounds:**

*   **Procedural Violations (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D)):** While related to the above, this would involve a more direct failure to follow required procedures, such as inadequate notice, failure to provide an opportunity for comment, or failure to publish the rule correctly. This is less likely if the standard notice-and-comment process was followed, but a failure to *meaningfully* consider comments can sometimes be framed as a procedural flaw.
*   **Exceeding Statutory Authority (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C)):** Agencies generally have statutory authority to charge fees for services. This argument would only succeed if IRA could show that the fees are so exorbitant or unrelated to the service provided that they effectively constitute a tax or a barrier to a right that Congress intended to be accessible, thereby exceeding the scope of EOIR's fee-setting authority. This is a higher bar.
*   **Constitutional Claims (e.g., Due Process, Access to Courts):** While the APA is the primary focus, the underlying concerns about access to justice could inform an arbitrary and capricious challenge. Directly challenging the fees as unconstitutional (e.g., violating due process by effectively denying access to a hearing or appeal) is generally more difficult against a rule of general applicability, as courts often defer to agency economic decisions. However, the *impact* on due process and access to courts strengthens the argument that EOIR failed to adequately consider a ""significant aspect of the problem.""

**III. Challenges and Likelihood of Success:**

*   **Agency Deference:** Courts generally grant significant deference to agency expertise, especially in matters of economic policy and resource allocation. IRA would need to present a strong case that EOIR's decision was truly unreasonable, not just that IRA disagrees with it.
*   **Administrative Record:** The court's review is limited to the administrative record – the documents, data, comments, and responses that were before the agency when it made its decision. IRA must demonstrate that the record itself reveals EOIR's failure to adequately consider the impacts or provide a reasoned explanation.
*   **Fee Waivers:** EOIR will likely argue that the availability of fee waivers mitigates the impact on low-income individuals. IRA would need to demonstrate that the fee waiver process is insufficient, overly burdensome, or does not fully address the systemic issues created by the increased fees.
*   **Burden of Proof:** IRA bears the burden of proving that EOIR's action was arbitrary and capricious.

**Conclusion:**

Immigrant Rights Advocates has a viable path to challenge the fee increases under the APA, primarily by arguing that EOIR's rule is **arbitrary and capricious** due to its failure to adequately consider the severe impacts on access to legal representation for low-income immigrants and the burden on non-profit legal service providers. The success of such a challenge would hinge on the strength of the administrative record and whether it demonstrates a clear lack of reasoned decision-making by EOIR regarding these critical issues. While challenging agency rules is difficult, the specific nature of IRA's argument—that EOIR overlooked a significant and foreseeable negative consequence of its rule—aligns well with established arbitrary and capricious jurisprudence.",[],,0.8224892020225525,15.439512195121953,25.377955766845815

Claims regarding eligibility for hardship waivers or the ability to ""stack"" waivers were not addressed by the Board of Immigration Appeals and, therefore, the court lacked jurisdiction to review them, finding no realistic possibility that a remand would lead to a different conclusion given the unappealable ground for removability.","No, the visa fraud waiver under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H) cannot be used.

A court determined that this waiver cannot overcome removability. This applies when a foreign national is charged under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(3)(B)(iii). This charge is typically for visa fraud convictions.","['U.S. Code Title 8 Section 1227: (B) major sources of precursor chemicals used in the production of illicit narcotics; or', 'U.S. Code Title 8 Section 1184: (5) if a government-owned entity in such country engages in the broadcast of copyrighted material, including films or television material, belonging to United States copyright owners without their express consent or such country fails to work towards the provision of adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights;', 'U.S. Code Title 8 Section 1182: (viii) addressing childhood obesity through in-school and after-school physical activities, and providing nutrition education to students, in elementary schools and secondary schools; or', 'U.S. Code Title 8 Section 1153: The definitions in the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.] apply in the administration of this section.\n\n**Definitions:**\n*   ""Employment-based visa"" means an immigrant visa issued pursuant to the numerical limitation under section 203(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1153(b)].\n*   ""Executive capacity"" has the meaning given in section 101(a)(44)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(44)(B)], as added by section 123 of Pub.

"A public interest organization submits a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to a federal agency, seeking all complaint records filed against its administrative judges. The agency responds by disclosing thousands of pages of documents, but with two types of redactions: (1) all administrative judges' names are redacted, with the agency arguing a blanket privacy interest under FOIA Exemption 6, and (2) discrete sentences or paragraphs within otherwise responsive complaint records are redacted, with the agency asserting that this information is ""non-responsive"" to the request, even if it does not fall under any FOIA exemption. The organization challenges both categories of redactions in court. How should a court rule on these challenges based on the provided case?","Based on the case ruling, the court should rule as follows:
1.  **Redaction of judges' names under Exemption 6:** The agency's categorical, across-the-board redaction of all administrative judges' names would likely be deemed inadequately justified. FOIA Exemption 6 does not categorically exempt individuals' identities, as the privacy and public interests at stake can vary depending on factors such as whether the judge is sitting or retired, the seriousness and number of complaints, and the potential for public understanding of government operations through disclosure. A more individualized inquiry, or a particularized showing for defined subgroups of judges, is required to properly balance the privacy interests against the public interest in disclosure.
2.  **Redaction of non-responsive information within responsive records:** The court should find no statutory basis for redacting ostensibly non-responsive information from a record once that record has been deemed responsive to a FOIA request. Under the statutory framework, once an agency identifies a record as responsive, the sole basis for withholding information within that record is if the information falls within one of FOIA's nine statutory exemptions.

Redacting non-exempt information on the basis of non-responsiveness within an otherwise responsive record is not permitted by the statute.","Based on the principles of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and how courts generally interpret its provisions, particularly the narrow construction of exemptions and the strong presumption in favor of disclosure, a court should rule as follows:

**1. Challenge to Redaction of Administrative Judges' Names (FOIA Exemption 6):**

The court should likely rule **against the agency** and order the disclosure of the administrative judges' names.

*   **FOIA Exemption 6 Standard:** Exemption 6 protects ""personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy."" This requires a two-part test: (1) whether the information is contained in a ""personnel and medical file or similar file,"" and (2) whether disclosure would constitute a ""clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.""
*   **Balancing Test:** The ""clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy"" prong requires balancing the individual's privacy interest against the public interest in disclosure.
    *   **Privacy Interest:** While administrative judges, like any individuals, have some privacy interest, it is generally diminished when their conduct in their official capacity is at issue. The potential for embarrassment or unwanted attention is a factor, but it must be weighed against the public's right to know.
    *   **Public Interest:** There is a strong public interest in the transparency and accountability of government officials, especially those who exercise significant public power, such as administrative judges. The public has a right to know the identities of officials against whom complaints have been filed, as this information is crucial for understanding how the agency functions, how it addresses misconduct, and whether its administrative justice system is fair and impartial. Knowing *who* is being complained about is essential for meaningful oversight and public discourse regarding the integrity of the administrative judiciary.
*   **Conclusion:** Courts generally find that the public interest in the accountability of public officials, particularly in the context of their official duties, outweighs the privacy interest in withholding their names from complaint records. A ""blanket"" assertion of privacy for all judges' names, without a more specific showing of harm, is unlikely to succeed given the strong public interest in government transparency and accountability.

**2. Challenge to Redaction of ""Non-Responsive"" Information (Not Falling Under an Exemption):**

The court should rule **against the agency** and order the disclosure of the redacted sentences or paragraphs.

*   **FOIA's Core Principle:** FOIA mandates the disclosure of government records unless they fall squarely within one of the nine enumerated exemptions. The burden is on the agency to demonstrate that withheld information is exempt.
*   **No ""Non-Responsive"" Exemption:** There is no FOIA exemption that permits an agency to redact information from an otherwise responsive document simply because the agency deems it ""non-responsive"" to the request, *if that information does not otherwise fall under an exemption*.
*   **Segregability Requirement:** FOIA explicitly requires agencies to ""disclose any reasonably segregable portion of a record after deletion of the portions which are exempt."" This means that if a document is responsive, and parts of it are not exempt, those non-exempt parts must be released, even if the agency subjectively believes they are not directly relevant to the *core* of the request. The agency cannot unilaterally narrow the scope of disclosure beyond what the exemptions permit.
*   **Conclusion:** The agency's justification for redacting ""non-responsive"" information that is not otherwise exempt is fundamentally flawed and contrary to FOIA's clear mandate. Once a record is determined to be responsive, any portion of it that does not fall under a specific FOIA exemption must be disclosed. The agency cannot create a *de facto* exemption for information it deems irrelevant.",[],,0.8490874767303467,17.10968531468531,19.755996503496533
"A U.S. company, ""InnovateTech Inc."", seeks to extend an H-1B visa for its foreign citizen employee, who works as a ""Lead Software Architect"" at a client site through a subcontracting arrangement. USCIS denies the extension, citing (1) a lack of sufficiently detailed, non-speculative day-to-day work assignments for the entire visa period, (2) perceived inconsistencies in the minimum degree requirements stated across different application documents (e.g., ""bachelor's degree in a computer-related field"" vs. ""bachelor's or higher degree in Information Technology or Computer Science""), and (3) insufficient evidence to prove InnovateTech has ""actual control"" over the employee's specific tasks at the client site, despite InnovateTech providing documentation confirming its exclusive right to hire, pay, fire, and supervise the employee. InnovateTech had also referenced the Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook to argue that a ""Lead Software Architect"" position typically requires a bachelor's degree in a specific specialty, but USCIS did not address this argument in its denial. Can InnovateTech successfully challenge this denial under the Administrative Procedure Act?","Yes, InnovateTech can likely successfully challenge the denial.

Second, USCIS's failure to meaningfully consider or even mention InnovateTech's argument that the position is akin to an occupation described in the Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook, which could satisfy the specialty occupation criteria, renders the decision arbitrary and capricious.

The court would likely grant InnovateTech's motion for summary judgment and remand the case for reconsideration consistent with these principles.","InnovateTech Inc. has a **reasonable chance** to successfully challenge this denial under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), particularly concerning two of the three stated reasons and USCIS's failure to address a key argument.

The APA allows for judicial review of agency actions that are ""arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law"" (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). To succeed, InnovateTech would need to demonstrate that USCIS's decision-making process was flawed, lacked a rational basis, or failed to consider relevant evidence or arguments.

Let's break down each of USCIS's denial reasons and InnovateTech's potential APA arguments:

1.  **Lack of sufficiently detailed, non-speculative day-to-day work assignments for the entire visa period:**
    *   **USCIS's Stance:** USCIS often requires detailed work assignments, especially for extensions and third-party placements, to ensure the position remains a specialty occupation for the entire requested period. They are wary of ""bench time"" or general, non-specialty work.
    *   **InnovateTech's Potential APA Argument:** InnovateTech could argue that demanding such granular, non-speculative detail for a multi-year period is **arbitrary and capricious** and does not reflect the reality of project-based IT work, where specific tasks evolve. They might argue that they provided a reasonable scope of work and typical duties for a ""Lead Software Architect,"" and requiring a minute-by-minute breakdown for years in advance is an impossible standard. However, USCIS has a strong basis in requiring proof of specialty occupation work for the *entire* period, so this is a challenging argument for InnovateTech.

2.  **Perceived inconsistencies in the minimum degree requirements stated across different application documents:**
    *   **USCIS's Stance:** Inconsistencies in the petition documents raise red flags about the veracity of the claims and whether the position truly qualifies as a specialty occupation. USCIS expects clarity and consistency.
    *   **InnovateTech's Potential APA Argument:** InnovateTech could argue that the perceived inconsistency (""bachelor's degree in a computer-related field"" vs. ""bachelor's or higher degree in Information Technology or Computer Science"") is **not material** or is a minor semantic difference that does not undermine the core requirement for a specialty occupation. They could argue that USCIS's focus on such a minor discrepancy, without providing an opportunity to clarify or explaining *why* it's a fatal inconsistency, is **arbitrary**. However, USCIS often takes a strict view on consistency, and the burden is on the petitioner to present a clear and unambiguous case. This is also a difficult argument to win.

3.  **Insufficient evidence to prove InnovateTech has ""actual control"" over the employee's specific tasks at the client site, despite InnovateTech providing documentation confirming its exclusive right to hire, pay, fire, and supervise the employee.**
    *   **USCIS's Stance:** This is a common issue in third-party placements. USCIS distinguishes between administrative control (hire, pay, fire) and ""actual control"" over the day-to-day tasks and work product. They want to see evidence that the petitioner (InnovateTech) directs *how* the work is done, not just that they are the employer of record.
    *   **InnovateTech's Potential APA Argument:** This is one of InnovateTech's **strongest arguments**. USCIS's denial, despite InnovateTech providing documentation confirming its exclusive right to ""supervise"" the employee, could be challenged as **arbitrary and capricious** or a **failure to consider relevant evidence**.
        *   InnovateTech can argue that ""supervise"" inherently implies control over tasks.
        *   They can argue that USCIS failed to adequately explain *why* the provided evidence of supervision was insufficient or what additional evidence would have satisfied the ""actual control"" requirement, especially when the petitioner explicitly stated they supervise.
        *   They could also argue that USCIS is applying an overly restrictive or unstated definition of ""actual control"" that is not consistent with its own policy guidance or precedent, or that it ignored the totality of the employer-employee relationship evidence.
        *   Courts have sometimes pushed back on USCIS's overly narrow interpretations of ""actual control"" in third-party placements.

4.  **USCIS did not address the Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH) argument.**
    *   **USCIS's Stance:** They simply ignored it.
    *   **InnovateTech's Potential APA Argument:** This is another of InnovateTech's **strongest arguments**. An agency's failure to address a material argument or consider relevant evidence presented by the petitioner can render a decision **arbitrary and capricious** because it indicates a lack of reasoned decision-making. The OOH is a recognized government source often used to establish that a position qualifies as a specialty occupation. If InnovateTech referenced it to support the ""Lead Software Architect"" position's specialty occupation nature, USCIS was generally obligated to address that argument, even if only to explain why it found it unpersuasive. Ignoring it entirely is a significant procedural flaw under the APA.

**Conclusion:**

InnovateTech faces an uphill battle, as immigration litigation is complex and courts generally defer to agency expertise. However, InnovateTech has **strong grounds** to challenge the denial based on:

*   USCIS's potential failure to adequately explain *why* InnovateTech's evidence of ""supervision"" was insufficient to establish ""actual control"" (Reason 3).
*   USCIS's complete failure to address the argument based on the Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook (Reason 4).

These two points suggest a potential **failure of reasoned decision-making** and a **failure to consider relevant evidence/arguments**, which are classic grounds for an APA challenge. If successful, a court would likely **remand** the case back to USCIS for reconsideration, requiring the agency to provide a more reasoned explanation for its decision, address the OOH argument, and properly evaluate the evidence of control. It would not automatically result in an approval of the H-1B extension.",[],,0.834590495,16.260227272727274,18.674026806526825

The court distinguishes such a case from situations where no subsequent NOH was received, concluding that the petition for review challenging the removal order should be denied.","Yes, the individual's admission to having received a subsequent Notice of Hearing (NOH) significantly affects their ability to successfully challenge the *in absentia* removal order based on a defective NTA.

Here's why:

1.  **Purpose of Notice for In Absentia Orders:** For an *in absentia* removal order to be valid, the government must demonstrate that the noncitizen received proper notice of the time and place of the proceedings and the consequences of failing to appear. The core requirement is that the individual was *actually notified* of their hearing.

2.  **The Role of the NOH in Curing a Defective NTA:** While the Supreme Court cases of *Pereira v. Sessions* (2018) and *Niz-Chavez v. Garland* (2021) established that an NTA without a specific date and time is not a ""notice to appear"" for purposes of the stop-time rule for cancellation of removal, these cases did not directly address the validity of *in absentia* orders.

    The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has directly addressed this issue in *Matter of Mendoza-Hernandez*, 28 I&N Dec. 520 (BIA 2022). The BIA held that **a subsequent NOH that provides the specific date, time, and place of the hearing, and is properly served, can cure a defective NTA for the purpose of issuing an *in absentia* removal order.**

3.  **Application to the Scenario:**
    *   The initial NTA was defective because it omitted the date and time.
    *   However, the individual *admits* to receiving a subsequent NOH.
    *   If this NOH contained all the necessary information (date, time, place of hearing, and consequences of failure to appear) and was properly served, then the individual received the required notice for the hearing.
    *   Since the individual received proper notice via the NOH, their failure to appear would likely justify the *in absentia* order, despite the initial defect in the NTA.

**Conclusion:**

"An individual, native and citizen of Mexico, is ordered removed from the U.S. after being convicted in Texas of aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon. The individual argues that this conviction does not qualify as an ""aggravated felony"" under federal immigration law, and thus he is not removable. He also challenges the denial of his motion for continuance, claiming the immigration judge abused discretion by finding he lacked ""good cause."" Based on U.S. federal court precedent, should the petition for review challenging the removability finding and the denial of continuance be granted?","No, the petition for review should be denied. Aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon under Texas law is considered a crime of violence and, therefore, an aggravated felony for purposes of federal immigration law because it requires the intentional or knowing use or attempted use of physical force with a deadly weapon.

Given that an immigration judge cited such factors, declining to find an abuse of discretion is appropriate.","Based on U.S. federal court precedent, the petition for review challenging the removability finding and the denial of continuance should **not** be granted.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1.  **Removability Finding (Aggravated Felony):**
    *   **Legal Standard:** Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), an alien convicted of an ""aggravated felony"" is removable. The term ""aggravated felony"" is broadly defined in INA § 101(a)(43).
    *   **Application to the Crime:** ""Aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon"" almost certainly qualifies as an ""aggravated felony"" under multiple provisions:
        *   **INA § 101(a)(43)(A):** This includes ""rape"" and ""sexual abuse of a minor."" Depending on the specifics of the Texas statute, aggravated sexual assault would likely fall under one of these categories.
        *   **INA § 101(a)(43)(F):** This includes a ""crime of violence"" for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year. A ""crime of violence"" is defined as an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or any felony that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense. Aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon unequivocally involves the use or threatened use of physical force and would almost certainly carry a sentence of more than one year.
    *   **Conclusion:** Federal courts consistently uphold removability findings when the underlying conviction clearly falls within the statutory definition of an aggravated felony. The individual's argument that this conviction does not qualify is highly unlikely to succeed.

2.  **Denial of Motion for Continuance:**
    *   **Legal Standard:** An Immigration Judge's (IJ) decision to grant or deny a motion for continuance is reviewed under a highly deferential ""abuse of discretion"" standard. To show abuse of discretion, the petitioner must demonstrate that the IJ acted arbitrarily, irrationally, or contrary to law, and that the denial caused actual prejudice. The burden is on the alien to show ""good cause"" for the continuance.
    *   **Application to the Scenario:** The question states the individual claims the IJ abused discretion by finding he lacked ""good cause,"" but it *does not provide any reason* for which the continuance was sought. Without knowing the specific reason for the request, it's impossible to evaluate whether ""good cause"" existed.
    *   **Precedent:** Federal courts routinely affirm IJ denials of continuances where the alien fails to articulate a compelling, non-speculative reason for the delay, or where the IJ's decision is reasonable in light of the facts presented. Common reasons for denying continuances include dilatory tactics, lack of diligence in pursuing relief, or speculative future events.
    *   **Conclusion:** Given the high bar for proving abuse of discretion and the lack of any stated reason for the continuance request, it is highly improbable that a federal court would find the IJ abused discretion. The IJ's finding of no ""good cause"" would likely be upheld.

Therefore, the petition for review would likely be denied on both grounds.",[],,0.8342650532722473,14.678122205663193,29.33602831594635
"An immigrant invested $500,000 in an American business, believing it would qualify them for an EB-5 immigrant investor visa. USCIS initially approved the I-526 petition but later initiated revocation proceedings, arguing the investment funds (loan proceeds from a jointly owned property) were not entirely the immigrant's ""own capital at risk.""

This designation significantly limits, and often eliminates, eligibility for most forms of immigration relief.

Here's a breakdown of the legal landscape concerning your client's situation:

---

### I. Aggravated Felony Analysis

The core of your client's concern is whether his conviction constitutes an ""aggravated felony"" under immigration law.

1.  **Definition of Aggravated Felony:**
    Section 101(a)(43) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)) defines a long list of offenses that are considered aggravated felonies. Specifically relevant here is:
    *   **INA § 101(a)(43)(D):** ""a money laundering offense in violation of section 1956 or 1957 of title 18, United States Code, if the amount of the funds laundered exceeds $10,000.""

2.  **Application to Client's Conviction:**
    *   **Statutory Match:** Your client was convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h), which is a conspiracy to commit money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956. This is a direct match to the INA's definition.
    *   **Amount Threshold:** The conviction involved ""over $10,000,"" which meets the statutory threshold for an aggravated felony.
    *   **Conspiracy:** The INA explicitly states that ""any attempt or conspiracy to commit"" an offense listed in INA § 101(a)(43) is also considered an aggravated felony. Therefore, a conviction for conspiracy to commit money laundering is treated the same as a conviction for the substantive offense itself for immigration purposes.

3.  **Client's Claim Regarding ""Overt Act"":**
    *   Your client's belief that his conviction did not require proof of an overt act is **unlikely to be a successful challenge** to the aggravated felony designation.
    *   **Federal Conspiracy Law (18 U.S.C. § 1956(h)):** Unlike some state conspiracy statutes or the general federal conspiracy statute (18 U.S.C. § 371), a conviction for conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) **does not require proof of an overt act**. The elements typically are: (1) an agreement between two or more persons to commit a money laundering offense, and (2) the defendant's knowing and voluntary participation in that agreement with the specific intent to violate the money laundering statute.
    *   **Immigration Law's Categorical Approach:** When determining if a conviction is an aggravated felony, immigration courts generally apply the ""categorical approach."" This involves comparing the elements of the criminal statute of conviction to the generic definition of the aggravated felony. If the statute of conviction criminalizes no more conduct than the generic definition, it's a categorical match. Here, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) perfectly aligns with INA § 101(a)(43)(D) when the amount exceeds $10,000. The absence of an overt act requirement in the federal statute does not make it *less* of a money laundering offense; it simply defines the elements of that specific federal crime.
    *   **Conclusion on Aggravated Felony:** Based on the information provided, it is **highly probable** that your client's conviction will be found to be an aggravated felony.

---

### II. Removability (Deportability)

An alien convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.
*   **INA § 237(a)(2)(A)(iii):** ""Any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.""
Since your client was lawfully present on an H1B visa (meaning he was admitted), and his conviction occurred after admission, he is clearly deportable under this ground.

---

### III. Eligibility for Relief and Waivers

The aggravated felony designation is a significant bar to most forms of immigration relief.

1.  **Cancellation of Removal:**
    *   **For Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) - INA § 240A(a):** This relief is **unavailable** to aliens convicted of an aggravated felony.
    *   **For Non-LPRs (like your H1B client) - INA § 240A(b):** This relief is also **unavailable** to aliens convicted of an aggravated felony.

2.  **Waiver of Inadmissibility (INA § 212(h)):**
    *   This waiver is generally for certain crimes involving moral turpitude (CIMT) or a single offense of simple possession of marijuana (30 grams or less).
    *   **Aggravated Felony Bar:** An alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony is generally **ineligible** for a 212(h) waiver. There is a narrow exception for LPRs who have resided in the U.S. for at least 7 years and have not been convicted of an aggravated felony that is also a CIMT. Your client is not an LPR, so this exception does not apply.
    *   **Conclusion:** A 212(h) waiver is **highly unlikely** to be available.

3.  **Waiver under INA § 212(c):**
    *   This form of relief was repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA). It is only available to a very limited class of individuals whose convictions or pleas occurred before April 1, 1997. It is **extremely unlikely** to be applicable to your client.

4.  **Asylum and Withholding of Removal:**
    *   An alien convicted of an aggravated felony is generally **barred** from asylum if the crime is determined to be a ""particularly serious crime."" Money laundering involving over $10,000 is almost certainly considered a ""particularly serious crime,"" making him ineligible for asylum.
    *   He would also be barred from withholding of removal if the aggravated felony is a ""particularly serious crime.""

5.  **Voluntary Departure:**
    *   While not a waiver, voluntary departure allows an alien to leave the U.S. at their own expense, avoiding a formal order of removal and its associated bars to future admission. However, an alien convicted of an aggravated felony is **ineligible** for voluntary departure.

**Conclusion on Relief:** Due to the aggravated felony conviction, your client's options for relief from removal are **severely limited, if not entirely eliminated.**

---

### IV. Procedural Challenges to Removal Proceedings

Your client's claims regarding procedural flaws in his removal proceedings are separate from the aggravated felony determination but could offer tactical advantages or temporary relief.

1.  **Defective Notice to Appear (NTA):**
    *   **Legal Precedent:** The Supreme Court cases *Pereira v. Sessions* (2018) and *Niz-Chavez v. Garland* (2021) established that for certain purposes (like stopping the ""stop-time rule"" for cancellation of removal or triggering the one-year asylum filing deadline), a Notice to Appear (NTA) must specify the time and place of the initial hearing. If the NTA initially issued to your client did not contain this information, it was defective.
    *   **Impact:** A defective NTA could be grounds to argue for **termination of removal proceedings without prejudice**. This means the government could re-file a new, properly issued NTA. While this would not eliminate the underlying ground of removability (the aggravated felony), it could buy your client significant time and potentially allow for a new strategy. It does not, however, negate the fact that he is deportable as an aggravated felon.

2.  **Missing Hearing Transcripts:**
    *   **Legal Precedent:** The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has held that missing or incomplete hearing transcripts can be grounds for remand or termination of proceedings if the missing portions are material and prejudice the alien's ability to appeal or present their case. (See, e.g., *Matter of L-A-B-R-*, 28 I&N Dec. 408 (BIA 2020)).
    *   **Impact:** If crucial portions of the hearing transcripts are genuinely missing and cannot be reconstructed, and if this absence prejudices your client's ability to pursue an appeal or demonstrate a due process violation, it could lead to a **remand for a new hearing** or even **termination of proceedings**. This is a strong procedural argument that could be pursued on appeal to the BIA or a federal circuit court. Like the NTA issue, this is a procedural victory that could delay or restart proceedings, but it does not erase the aggravated felony conviction.

---

### V. Conclusion and Recommendations

Your client is in a precarious position. His conviction for conspiracy to commit money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) involving over $10,000 almost certainly qualifies as an aggravated felony under INA § 101(a)(43)(D). This designation makes him deportable and bars him from nearly all forms of relief from removal, including cancellation of removal and most waivers. His claim regarding the ""overt act"" is unlikely to succeed in challenging the aggravated felony designation given the specific federal statute of conviction.

While the procedural challenges regarding a defective NTA and missing transcripts are valid and could lead to a temporary termination or remand of his removal proceedings, they do not address the underlying aggravated felony ground of removability. These challenges are tactical and could buy time, but they do not provide a path to permanently avoid removal based on the conviction itself.

**Immediate Recommendations:**

1.  **Retain Experienced Immigration Counsel:** Your client needs an immigration attorney with extensive experience in aggravated felony cases and federal court litigation. This is not a case for general practitioners.
2.  **Review Conviction Documents:** A thorough review of the criminal court record (indictment, plea agreement, judgment of conviction, sentencing transcript) is critical to confirm the elements of the conviction and ensure no errors were made in the aggravated felony determination.

"A manufacturing company, facing numerous charges for failing to verify employee work authorization and knowingly continuing to employ unauthorized aliens, seeks to overturn an administrative law judge's decision. The company argues that it acted in good faith by hiring a purportedly qualified HR director whose negligence led to the violations. It also claims that many violations are barred by the five-year statute of limitations. Furthermore, the company challenges the summarily imposed civil penalties, arguing that its severe financial distress (including significant net losses and pending bankruptcy) constitutes a material factual dispute regarding its ability to pay, which should have precluded summary determination of the penalty amount. How would a federal court likely rule on each of these arguments?","A federal court would likely rule as follows:
1.  **Good Faith Defense:** The court would likely reject the good faith defenses. The defense under 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(a)(3) applies only to knowing *hiring* violations, not *continuing employment* or *paperwork* violations. The defense under 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(6) is limited to *technical or procedural* failures, not substantive ones, and the HR director's failure to perform their duties would be properly imputed to the company as its agent.
2.  **Statute of Limitations (General):** The court would likely reject a generalized statute of limitations defense for most violations if it was not properly asserted with a statement of facts as required by 28 C.F.R. § 68.9(c). For paperwork violations, the five-year limitations period is measured from when the company was no longer required to retain the I-9 form (three years after hire or one year after termination, whichever is later). For continuing employment violations, it is measured from the last day of the ineligible alien's employment.
3.  **Statute of Limitations (Specific Untimely Claim):** However, the court would likely grant the petition for review as to a specific violation if the claim accrued more than five years before the administrative action was commenced (e.g., employment ended before the five-year window) and the agency itself had conceded the untimeliness. The limitations period begins when the claim first accrued, not when the penalty is administratively imposed.
4.  **Summary Determination of Penalty:** The court would likely uphold the summary determination of the penalty. While ""ability to pay"" is a factor that an ALJ may consider at their discretion, it is not one of the five mandatory factors listed in 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(e)(5). Because it is within the ALJ's power to decline to consider this factor at all, the company's ability to pay is not considered a *material* issue of fact that would preclude summary determination of the penalty amount.

1.  **Good Faith Defense:** The court would likely reject the good faith defenses. The defense under 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(a)(3) applies only to knowing *hiring* violations, not *continuing employment* or *paperwork* violations. The defense under 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(6) is limited to *technical or procedural* failures, not substantive ones, and the HR director's failure to perform their duties would be properly imputed to the company as its agent.
2.  **Statute of Limitations (General):** The court would likely reject a generalized statute of limitations defense for most violations if it was not properly asserted with a statement of facts as required by 28 C.F.R. § 68.9(c). For paperwork violations, the five-year limitations period is measured from when the company was no longer required to retain the I-9 form (three years after hire or one year after termination, whichever is later). For continuing employment violations, it is measured from the last day of the ineligible alien's employment.
3.  **Statute of Limitations (Specific Untimely Claim):** However, the court would likely grant the petition for review as to a specific violation if the claim accrued more than five years before the administrative action was commenced (e.g., employment ended before the five-year window) and the agency itself had conceded the untimeliness. The limitations period begins when the claim first accrued, not when the penalty is administratively imposed.
4.  **Summary Determination of Penalty:** The court would likely uphold the summary determination of the penalty. While ""ability to pay"" is a factor that an ALJ may consider at their discretion, it is not one of the five mandatory factors listed in 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(e)(5). Because it is within the ALJ's power to decline to consider this factor at all, the company's ability to pay is not considered a *material* issue of fact that would preclude summary determination of the penalty amount. The ALJ's decision to proceed despite ambiguities in financial evidence would be considered an implicit choice to give that factor no weight, and this does not warrant reversal. The court would also typically uphold the ALJ's consideration of the statutory factors (size of business, good faith, seriousness of violations, whether the employee is an unauthorized alien, and history of previous violations) if the penalty falls within the prescribed monetary range and is reasonably based on the evidence presented.","A federal court would likely rule on each of these arguments as follows:

1.  **Argument: Good Faith by Hiring a Negligent HR Director**
    *   **Likely Ruling: Reject.**
    *   **Reasoning:** A company's responsibility for verifying employee work authorization and avoiding the employment of unauthorized aliens is a non-delegable duty. While hiring an HR director is a step towards compliance, the company remains ultimately accountable for ensuring that its I-9 procedures are correctly followed. The negligence of an employee, even a purportedly qualified HR director, is generally imputed to the company.
        *   For **technical I-9 violations** (e.g., incorrect form completion, missing documents), these are often considered strict liability offenses. The company's ""good faith"" in hiring an HR director does not excuse the actual failure to comply with the regulations.
        *   For **knowingly continuing to employ unauthorized aliens**, the ""knowing"" standard can be met by actual knowledge or constructive knowledge (e.g., through willful blindness or reckless disregard). If the HR director's negligence was so severe that it led to systemic failures that should have been apparent to the company, or if the company failed to adequately supervise the HR director, this argument would likely fail. The company cannot simply outsource its legal obligations and then claim good faith when those obligations are not met. Good faith is typically considered a mitigating factor in penalty assessment, not a complete defense to liability.

2.  **Argument: Many Violations Barred by the Five-Year Statute of Limitations**
    *   **Likely Ruling: Uphold (for specific violations).**
    *   **Reasoning:** The general statute of limitations for civil penalties, fines, or forfeitures under federal law is five years, as set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 2462. This statute applies to civil penalties under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), including those for I-9 violations.
        *   The five-year period typically begins when the violation occurs. For example, a failure to properly complete an I-9 form occurs at the time of hire. Knowingly employing an unauthorized alien is a continuing violation, but the initial act of ""knowing employment"" would trigger the clock.
        *   If the government's Notice of Intent to Fine (NIF) or other initiating enforcement action was issued more than five years after specific violations occurred, those particular violations would likely be deemed time-barred. The federal court would likely review the dates of the alleged violations against the date the enforcement action was initiated to determine which, if any, fall outside the five-year window.

3.  **Argument: Financial Distress Precluded Summary Determination of Penalties**
    *   **Likely Ruling: Uphold.**
    *   **Reasoning:** When assessing civil penalties for I-9 violations, the administrative law judge (ALJ) is required to consider several factors, including the size of the business, the seriousness of the violation, the employer's good faith, the history of previous violations, and **the ability to pay the penalty**.
        *   The company's claim of ""severe financial distress (including significant net losses and pending bankruptcy)"" directly relates to its ability to pay. This is a **material factual dispute**. Summary judgment (or summary determination of penalties) is only appropriate when there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
        *   By presenting evidence of its financial hardship, the company has raised a genuine issue regarding a statutorily mandated factor for penalty assessment. An ALJ's summary imposition of penalties without a full evidentiary hearing or proper consideration of this evidence would likely be considered an abuse of discretion or a violation of due process.
        *   A federal court would likely **remand** the case back to the ALJ for a proper determination of the penalty amount, requiring the ALJ to fully consider the company's financial condition and ability to pay before imposing a final penalty.",[],,0.84075743,14.988586321457213,24.57529900332227

Here's a breakdown of why:

1.  **Final Agency Action:**
    *   **APA Standard:** Under 5 U.S.C. § 704, an agency action is ""final"" if it marks the consummation of the agency's decision-making process and if it is one by which rights or obligations have been determined or from which legal consequences will flow.
    *   **Application:** The letters terminating the students' F-1 nonimmigrant student status meet this standard.
        *   **Consummation:** The termination letter is not a preliminary or tentative step; it is the definitive decision by DHS to end their status. There is no further administrative step within the termination process itself.
        *   **Legal Consequences:** The termination immediately determines the students' rights (they lose their legal status) and has severe legal consequences. They begin accruing ""unlawful presence,"" become subject to potential arrest and removal proceedings, lose their ability to study, and face future bars to re-entry into the U.S.
    *   **Reinstatement/Removal:** The availability of a *separate, discretionary* process (reinstatement) or a *defensive, adversarial* process (removal proceedings) does not negate the finality of the initial termination decision. The termination itself is a completed act with immediate legal effect.

2.  **Ripeness for Review:**
    *   **Purpose:** The ripeness doctrine aims to prevent courts from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies and to protect agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way.
    *   **Two-Prong Test (from *Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner*):**
        1.  **Fitness of the issues for judicial decision:** This considers whether the issues are purely legal and whether further factual development is needed.
        2.  **Hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration:** This assesses the direct and immediate impact of the agency action on the parties.
    *   **Application:**
        *   **Fitness:** The core legal questions in this case—whether ""fraudulent enrollment"" in a DHS-created sham university constitutes a valid basis for F-1 termination, and whether the students were afforded due process—are primarily legal questions. The facts of the sting operation and the enrollment are known. Further factual development within the agency is unlikely to clarify these legal issues.
        *   **Hardship:** The students face immediate and significant hardship by the termination of their F-1 status.
            *   They lose their legal status, which is a fundamental right to remain in the country.
            *   They begin accruing unlawful presence, which can lead to future bars to admission.
            *   They are subject to potential arrest, detention, and removal proceedings.
            *   They lose their ability to pursue their education.
            *   Forcing them to wait for removal proceedings (which are highly adversarial and carry the severe consequence of deportation) or to pursue a discretionary reinstatement application (which may not address the underlying legality of the termination or the due process claims) imposes a substantial burden and risk. Judicial review at this stage would prevent these harms from escalating.

**Conclusion:**

The District Court's reasoning likely misconstrued the concepts of final agency action and ripeness. The termination letters definitively ended the students' F-1 status, triggering immediate and severe legal consequences. The availability of subsequent, separate administrative processes (reinstatement or removal proceedings) does not render the initial termination non-final or unripe. To hold otherwise would force students to endure significant hardship and potential deportation before they could challenge the legality of the government's initial action, which is contrary to the principles of judicial review under the APA.",[],,0.8296811580657959,15.054661036828524,23.24173469387756

"Under what circumstances will a U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia transfer a case challenging a USCIS visa denial to another district, particularly when the plaintiff chose the D.C. forum but the administrative decision was made elsewhere?","A U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia will transfer a case challenging a USCIS visa denial to another district, such as the District of Nebraska, when the balance of private and public interest factors strongly favors the transferee forum. In such cases, the court will grant a motion to transfer pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), concluding that the case ""might have been brought"" in the transferee court and that transfer is ""in the interest of justice.""

Specifically, the court considers:
1.  **Propriety of Venue in Transferee Court:** Venue is proper in the transferee court if, under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e), a defendant resides there, a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred there, or the plaintiff resides there. For cases challenging USCIS decisions, venue is typically proper in the district where the relevant service center (e.g., Nebraska Service Center) is located and processed the petition, or where the plaintiff resides.
2.  **Balancing of Private Interest Factors:**
    *   **Plaintiff's Choice of Forum:** The deference given to the plaintiff's choice of forum is significantly reduced when it is not the plaintiff's home forum and lacks meaningful ties to the controversy. If the administrative decision being challenged was made in another district, the D.C. court will give ""nadir"" deference to the plaintiff's choice to sue in D.C.
    *   **Defendant's Choice of Forum:** This choice gains some deference, especially when the defendants seek transfer to the plaintiff's home forum or where the claim arose.
    *   **Where the Claim Arose:** This is a predominant factor. In Administrative Procedure Act (APA) cases challenging agency action, the claim generally arises where the decision-making process occurred. If the visa petition was processed, adjudicated, and denied by a USCIS service center in another district (e.g., Nebraska), then the claim arose in that district, not D.C., even if general agency policies were formulated in D.C., unless there are credible allegations of direct, case-specific involvement by D.C.-based officials.
    *   **Convenience of Parties, Witnesses, and Access to Proof:** Convenience factors typically favor the district where the plaintiff resides (if applicable) or, more strongly, the district where the administrative record is located and where the agency personnel involved in the challenged decision reside, as APA cases are generally resolved on the administrative record.
3.  **Balancing of Public Interest Factors:**
    *   **Familiarity with Governing Laws:** This factor is neutral for federal law cases as all federal courts are presumed equally familiar.
    *   **Relative Congestion of Calendars:** While current statistics might slightly favor D.C. in terms of caseload, this factor is often a ""wash"" due to the difficulty of accurate assessment and the concern about future congestion if D.C. retains cases with little connection to the district.
    *   **Local Interest in Resolving the Controversy:** This is the ""most important"" public factor. The district where the challenged decision was made (e.g., Nebraska Service Center) has the strongest local interest, especially if the relief sought involves compelling specific actions in that district. A case challenging a single visa petition's denial is typically not considered one of ""national significance.""

In sum, the court will transfer the case to the district where the administrative decision was made and where the bulk of the administrative record and relevant agency personnel are located, finding it to be the optimal venue when D.C. lacks meaningful ties to the specific controversy.","[('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['melnattur v. united states citizenship and immigration services', 'ngonga v. sessions', 'stewart org. inc. v. ricoh corp.', 'aracely v. nielsen', 'gyau v. sessions', 'pengbo li v. miller no.', 'ike v. uscis', 'efficientip inc. v. cuccinelli no.', 'wolfram alpha llc v. cuccinelli', 'united states v.', 'bahena v. renaud', 'pasem v. uscis', 'aishat v. u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'bourdon v. u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'lamont v. haig', 'aftab v. gonzalez', 'norton v. s. utah wilderness all.', 'fed. hous. fin. agency v. first tenn. bank natl assn', 'cameron v. thornburgh', 'stewart v. azar', 'greater yellowstone coal. v. bosworth', 'trout unlimited v. u.s. dept of agric.', 'huskey v. quinlan', 'abusadeh v. chertoff no.']",[],[],0,0,0,"A U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia will transfer a case challenging a USCIS visa denial to another district, such as the District of Nebraska, when the balance of private and public interest factors strongly favors the transferee forum.

Specifically, the court considers:
1.  **Propriety of Venue in Transferee Court:** Venue is proper in the transferee court if, under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e), a defendant resides there, a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred there, or the plaintiff resides there. For cases challenging USCIS decisions, venue is typically proper in the district where the relevant service center (e.g., Nebraska Service Center) is located and processed the petition, or where the plaintiff resides.
2.  **Balancing of Private Interest Factors:**
    *   **Plaintiff's Choice of Forum:** The deference given to the plaintiff's choice of forum is significantly reduced when it is not the plaintiff's home forum and lacks meaningful ties to the controversy. If the administrative decision being challenged was made in another district, the D.C. court will give ""nadir"" deference to the plaintiff's choice to sue in D.C.
    *   **Defendant's Choice of Forum:** This choice gains some deference, especially when the defendants seek transfer to the plaintiff's home forum or where the claim arose.

In sum, the court will transfer the case to the district where the administrative decision was made and where the bulk of the administrative record and relevant agency personnel are located, finding it to be the optimal venue when D.C. lacks meaningful ties to the specific controversy.","A U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia (D.C.) will consider transferring a case challenging a USCIS visa denial to another district, even when the plaintiff chose the D.C. forum and the administrative decision was made elsewhere, primarily under the provisions of **28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)**, which allows for transfer ""for the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice.""

Here's a breakdown of the circumstances and factors involved:

**1. Initial Venue Considerations (Why D.C. is often proper):**

First, it's important to understand why D.C. is often a proper venue for these cases, even if the decision was made elsewhere. Under **28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)**, a civil action against a federal agency or officer acting in an official capacity may be brought in any judicial district in which:
*   a defendant resides (e.g., the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of USCIS, whose official residences are in D.C.);
*   a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred; or
*   the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action.

Because the ultimate authority for USCIS decisions often rests with officials in D.C., and the agency's headquarters are there, D.C. is frequently a proper venue. This means a transfer would typically be under § 1404(a) (convenience) rather than § 1406(a) (improper venue).

**2. Factors for Transfer Under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a):**

The burden is on the party seeking the transfer (usually the government) to demonstrate that the balance of convenience and the interest of justice strongly favor transfer. The plaintiff's choice of forum is given substantial deference, especially when it is a proper venue.

The court will weigh several factors, often categorized as ""private interest"" and ""public interest"" factors:

**A. Private Interest Factors (Convenience of Parties and Witnesses):**

*   **Plaintiff's Choice of Forum:** This is a significant factor. The D.C. court will be reluctant to disturb the plaintiff's choice unless the other factors strongly outweigh it. Plaintiffs often choose D.C. due to specialized counsel, perceived judicial expertise in administrative law, or the convenience of suing the agency at its headquarters.
*   **Convenience of the Parties:**
    *   **Plaintiff:** If the plaintiff resides far from D.C. and would face significant hardship (financial, logistical, health-related) in litigating in D.C., this weighs in favor of transfer to their home district.
    *   **Government:** The government often argues that its local field office personnel (who made the initial decision or conducted interviews) are more conveniently located in the plaintiff's home district. However, many of these cases are decided on the administrative record, and government attorneys are often D.C.-based.
*   **Convenience of Witnesses:**
    *   **Plaintiff's Witnesses:** If there are non-party witnesses (e.g., family members, employers, medical professionals) whose testimony is crucial and who reside in the plaintiff's home district, this weighs in favor of transfer.
    *   **Government Witnesses:** Often, the ""witnesses"" are government officials whose testimony is provided via affidavit or deposition, making their physical location less critical.
*   **Location of Relevant Evidence:** In most administrative review cases, the ""evidence"" is the administrative record, which is typically electronic and easily accessible from any district. Thus, this factor rarely weighs heavily in favor of transfer.

**B. Public Interest Factors (Interest of Justice):**

*   **Docket Congestion:** D.C. courts are often busy. If the transferee court has a significantly lighter docket, this could be a minor factor, but rarely dispositive on its own.
*   **Local Interest in the Controversy:** While immigration law is federal, there might be a stronger local interest in a case involving a resident of that community. However, this is often a weak factor in visa denial cases.
*   **Familiarity with Applicable Law:** All federal courts are equally capable of applying federal immigration law.
*   **Avoidance of Unnecessary Problems with Conflict of Laws:** Not relevant in federal question cases.
*   **Cost of Litigation:** The overall cost to the parties, including travel and lodging, can be a factor.

**3. When Transfer is More Likely (Despite Plaintiff's Choice):**

A D.C. court is more likely to transfer a case when:

*   **Overwhelming Inconvenience to the Plaintiff:** The plaintiff can demonstrate severe hardship in litigating in D.C., and all their relevant non-agency witnesses and evidence are concentrated in a single other district.
*   **No Substantive Connection to D.C. (Beyond Agency Headquarters):** If the plaintiff, the underlying events, and all potential non-agency witnesses are located in a single, distant district, and the only connection to D.C. is the agency's headquarters.
*   **Government Demonstrates Specific, Significant Prejudice:** The government can articulate concrete reasons why litigating in D.C. would genuinely impede its ability to present its case or would be significantly more costly and inefficient than in the proposed transferee district (e.g., a specific field officer's live testimony is truly critical and they are far from D.C.).
*   **Forum Shopping Concerns (Rare):** While less common in these types of cases, if there's evidence the plaintiff chose D.C. for an improper tactical advantage rather than legitimate reasons.

**In summary:** While a plaintiff's choice of the D.C. forum is given substantial weight, a U.S. District Court in D.C. will transfer a USCIS visa denial case if the government can demonstrate that the balance of convenience for parties and witnesses, combined with the interest of justice, *strongly* favors transfer to another district where the case could have originally been brought. This typically requires showing significant inconvenience to the plaintiff or the government that outweighs the deference given to the plaintiff's initial forum selection.",[],,0.8742533922195435,11.42931171474422,40.17459421112375
"Apex Construction Inc. hired several new employees. For some, the employees signed Section 1 of the I-9 Form but failed to check the box indicating their specific work authorization status (e.g., U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident). For others, Apex completed Section 2 but failed to list the issuing authority for a driver's license presented as proof of identity. Apex had photocopied all identity and work authorization documents and kept them in a separate folder, believing that the copies, combined with the employee's signature, fulfilled its obligations. During an ICE inspection, these issues were flagged. Apex later produced the copied documents during the administrative hearing, arguing they cured the I-9 deficiencies and showed good faith. Apex now faces civil penalties. Based on the *Ketchikan Drywall Services* decision, how should a court evaluate Apex Construction Inc.'s arguments regarding its I-9 compliance, the nature of its violations, and the potential for penalty mitigation?","Based on the *Ketchikan Drywall Services* decision, Apex Construction Inc.'s arguments would likely be rejected, and the penalties upheld. The court would find that employers must fully complete I-9 Forms, and merely copying and retaining verification documents is neither necessary nor sufficient for compliance, nor does it relieve the employer of the requirement to fully complete Section 2. The regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 274a.2(b)(3), clarifies that copying and retention do not relieve the employer from fully completing Section 2, superseding any prior interpretations to the contrary.

Regarding the specific violations:
1.  **Failure to check a specific box in Section 1:** This is considered a ""substantive"" verification failure under the Virtue Memorandum (which the court grants Skidmore deference). Employees are required to attest to a specific category of eligibility, and failure to check the appropriate box means the statutory requirement (8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(2)) is unfulfilled, regardless of whether other documentation might allow ICE to deduce the employee's status. Employers are responsible for ensuring Section 1 is completely filled out by employees.
2.  **Failure to list the issuing authority for a List B document (e.g., driver's license) in Section 2:** This is a substantive failure. Employers have an obligation to fill out Section 2 of their I-9 Forms ""fully,"" and the absence of the issuing authority constitutes a failure to identify the document utilized, even if ICE might deduce the information from other details.

The court would likely find that the late production of copied documents during the administrative hearing cannot cure substantive deficiencies. The Virtue Memorandum only excuses certain substantive deficiencies where the missing information is found ""on a legible copy of a document retained *with* the Form I-9 and *presented at the I-9 inspection*."" Documents not presented at the initial I-9 inspection do not qualify. The penalties are imposed for substantive deficiencies on the I-9 Forms themselves, not for the manner or timing of document storage or production.

Finally, concerning penalty mitigation, the ALJ has broad discretion. A refusal to mitigate for ""good faith"" would be permissible if, for example, Apex had a history of non-compliance or demonstrated a lack of timely effort to ascertain and conform to the law.

Here's why:

1.  **Lack of Official Nonprofit Status:** This is a fundamental requirement for organizations seeking BIA recognition to provide immigration legal services. The BIA's regulations (8 CFR Part 292) are designed for religious, charitable, social service, or similar *nonprofit* organizations. Without official nonprofit status (typically IRS 501(c)(3)), the organization does not meet a core eligibility criterion.

2.  **Conflict of Interest and Undue Influence:** The most significant concern is the shared physical location, officers, and directors with a for-profit job placement company that *also provides immigration services*. This creates an unacceptable conflict of interest and a high potential for the ""nonprofit"" entity to be unduly influenced by the for-profit venture's pecuniary (financial) interests.
    *   The BIA requires recognized organizations to operate independently and to prioritize the provision of low-cost or free services to indigent persons, not to generate profit.
    *   Sharing leadership and resources with a for-profit entity providing similar services raises serious questions about the organization's true mission, its ability to act solely in the best interest of its clients, and the potential for client funneling or other unethical practices.

3.  **DHS Recommendation Against Approval:** The Department of Homeland Security's recommendation carries significant weight with the BIA. When DHS identifies such clear and substantial concerns, the BIA is highly likely to concur.

The BIA's primary goal in granting recognition is to ensure that vulnerable immigrants receive competent, ethical, and affordable legal assistance from organizations that are genuinely committed to public service, not profit.

2.  **Congressional Timetable:** While 8 U.S.C. § 1571(b) suggests processing within 180 days (six months), the plaintiff's applications had been pending for less than four months when the decision was made, so this factor favored defendants *for the moment*.
3.  **Human Health and Welfare / Interests Prejudiced:** These factors favored the plaintiff, acknowledging the significant hardship beyond mere economic harm, including loss of employment, inability to drive, and potential impact on her new restaurant's employees, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
4.  **Effect on Competing Priorities:** This factor favored defendants. Granting relief would place the plaintiff ahead of other similarly situated applicants facing delays due to USCIS backlogs in biometrics scheduling, merely reordering the queue without addressing the systemic issue.
Considering these factors as a whole, the court concluded that the rule of reason, the fact that the six-month congressional window had not yet elapsed, and the concern about reordering the queue outweighed the substantial hardships to the plaintiff, meaning the delay was not yet ""so egregious as to warrant mandamus"" or APA relief.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['nibber v. united states citizenship and immigration services', 'sherley v. sebelius', 'univ. of tex. v. camenisch', 'winter v. nat. res. def. council inc.', 'league of women voters of u.s. v. newby', 'pursuing am.s greatness v. fec', 'aamer v. obama', 'munaf v. geren', 'gonzales v. o centro espirita beneficente união do vegetal', 'mazurek v. armstrong', 'archdiocese of wash. v. wash. metro. area. transit auth.', 'davis v. pension benefit guar. corp.', 'singh v. carter', 'norton v. s. utah wilderness all.', 'am. hosp. assn v. burwell', 'uranga v. u.s. citizenship & immigr. servs.', 'gonzales v. cissna', 'a.c.c.s. v. nielsen', 'muvvala v. wolf', 'natl assn of mfrs. v. sec', 'emergency coal. to defend educ. travel v. dept of treasury', 'ray v. cuccinelli', 'khan v. johnson', 'islam v. heinauer', 'konchitsky v. chertoff', 'mashpee wampanoag tribal council inc. v. norton', 'liberty fund inc. v. chao']",[],[],0,0,0,"No, the individual is not likely to succeed on the merits of her claim and thus will not be granted a preliminary injunction.

Here's an analysis of the *TRAC* factors as applied to her situation:

1.  **The time agencies take to make decisions must be governed by a ""rule of reason.""**
    *   **Application:** While the delay has caused significant hardship (job loss, driver's license loss), USCIS often faces systemic backlogs. Courts are generally reluctant to find a ""rule of reason"" violation unless the delay is truly egregious and without any plausible explanation from the agency. The fact that it's a renewal, not an initial application, might slightly favor the applicant, but the overall context of USCIS processing times is often considered.

2.  **Where Congress has provided a timetable or other indication of the speed with which it expects the agency to act, that timetable is a good indicator of what is reasonable.**
    *   **Application:** This is a major hurdle for the applicant. There are generally **no specific statutory deadlines** for USCIS to adjudicate H-4 or EAD renewal applications. USCIS is only required to process applications within a ""reasonable time."" Without a missed statutory deadline, it's much harder to prove unreasonable delay.

3.  **Delays that might be reasonable in the sphere of economic regulation are less tolerable when human health and welfare are at stake.**
    *   **Application:** This factor strongly favors the applicant. The delay has directly impacted her ability to work, earn income, and even drive, which are fundamental aspects of human welfare and daily life. The loss of a job and driver's license due to administrative delay is a severe personal hardship.

4.  **The court should consider the effect of expediting delayed action on agency activities of a higher priority.**
    *   **Application:** This factor strongly weighs against the applicant. USCIS would argue that it has millions of applications pending, and compelling adjudication of one case would necessarily delay others, potentially those with higher priority (e.g., national security concerns, asylum claims, or other urgent humanitarian cases). Courts are generally deferential to an agency's resource allocation and prioritization.

5.  **The court should consider the nature and extent of the interests prejudiced by the delay.**
    *   **Application:** This factor strongly favors the applicant, echoing factor 3. Her interests are severely prejudiced by the loss of employment, income, and mobility. This is a direct and substantial harm.

6.  **The court need not find any impropriety underlying the agency's action (or inaction).**
    *   **Application:** This factor is neutral. The applicant doesn't need to prove bad faith, only unreasonable delay. However, the absence of impropriety doesn't automatically mean the delay is unreasonable in a legal sense.

**Conclusion on Likelihood of Success on the Merits:**

While the individual faces severe personal hardship (Factors 3 and 5), which is compelling, the lack of a statutory deadline for H-4/EAD renewals (Factor 2) and the deference courts give to agency resource allocation and prioritization (Factor 4) make it very difficult to succeed on the merits of an unreasonable delay claim. Courts are generally hesitant to compel USCIS to adjudicate specific applications out of turn, as it would effectively require them to manage the agency's backlog.

Therefore, despite the significant and undeniable harm, she is **unlikely to succeed on the merits** of her claim that USCIS's delay is legally ""unreasonable"" under the *TRAC* factors, especially when balanced against the agency's general processing challenges and the lack of a specific statutory mandate. This makes the grant of a preliminary injunction, which requires a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, improbable.",[],,0.8491392135620117,13.6115,30.870750000000015

1.  **Asylum:**

The ransacking of the vacant home was a singular event that did not cause serious or permanent damage and was more akin to ""abusive or harassing treatment"" than ""extreme conduct"" required for persecution. The incidents (ransacking and Navy vehicles driving by) did not create a threat sufficiently menacing or imminent to amount to persecution. Rangel had publicly campaigned against the Navy for four months without physical harm or direct threats, and the alleged threat lacked the ""organized, relentless campaign of intimidation"" found in cases compelling a finding of persecution.
    *   **Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution:** The BIA did not err. Petitioners failed to establish past persecution, thus were not entitled to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear. Rangel had publicly campaigned against the Navy for four months without suffering physical harm, threats, or reprisals until the ransacking, and no further threats took place after that incident. There was no indication the Navy remained interested in or actively searching for petitioners, and the disappearance of Rangel's other son was determined to be unrelated to her campaigning.

2.  **Withholding of Removal:** The BIA did not err. Withholding of removal is a higher standard than asylum. Since petitioners failed to demonstrate they suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution for asylum, they necessarily failed to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.

3.  **Convention Against Torture (CAT) Relief:** The BIA did not err. Torture is a higher bar than persecution.

Claims for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture would be significantly more difficult to establish.

Here's a breakdown:

### 1. Asylum

**Legal Standard:** To be granted asylum, an applicant must demonstrate either:
*   **Past Persecution:** They have suffered persecution in the past on account of a protected ground (race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion). If past persecution is established, a presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution arises.
*   **Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution:** They have a subjective fear and an objectively reasonable basis to fear future persecution on account of a protected ground if returned to their home country. This requires showing a ""reasonable possibility"" of persecution.

**Application to the Case:**

*   **Protected Ground:** The most relevant protected ground here is **political opinion**. Publicly campaigning against the Mexican Navy following her son's disappearance is a clear expression of a political opinion critical of a state institution.
*   **Past Persecution:**
    *   **The ransacking of her vacant home:** This is a serious act of intimidation and property damage. While not directly physical harm, it could be considered persecution, especially when viewed in context. It suggests a direct response to her activism.
    *   **Observation of Navy vehicles:** While a single instance, it reinforces the idea that her activities are being monitored by the very entity she is criticizing, linking the ransacking to the Navy.
    *   **Nexus:** The ransacking and surveillance occurred *after* and presumably *because of* her public campaign against the Navy.
    *   **Government Involvement/Acquiescence:** The observation of Navy vehicles and the nature of her campaign strongly suggest that the Mexican Navy (a government entity) is either directly involved in the intimidation or is unwilling/unable to protect her from those acting on its behalf.
    *   **Conclusion on Past Persecution:** While the incidents did not involve direct physical harm or repeated threats, the ransacking of her home by unknown actors, coupled with the Navy's surveillance, following her public criticism of the Navy, could be argued as past persecution. It's a strong act of intimidation directly linked to her political opinion.

*   **Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution:** This is likely the strongest aspect of her claim.
    *   **Subjective Fear:** Given the ransacking, the disappearance of her son, and the Navy's surveillance, it is entirely reasonable for her to genuinely fear returning.
    *   **Objective Fear:**
        *   She publicly challenged a powerful state institution (the Navy) in a country where such challenges can lead to severe repercussions.
        *   The ransacking of her home served as a clear warning or act of intimidation.
        *   The Navy's surveillance indicates she is on their radar.
        *   The lack of *further* incidents could be interpreted as the initial acts being a successful warning, but it does not negate the underlying threat or the reasonable possibility of future harm if she continues her activism or is perceived as a threat.
        *   The Mexican government (specifically the Navy) is unlikely to protect her from itself or its affiliates.
    *   **Conclusion on Well-Founded Fear:** There is a reasonable possibility that she would face further persecution (e.g., more severe intimidation, threats, or harm) if she returns to Mexico and potentially continues her activism, given the initial acts of retaliation and surveillance by a powerful state actor.

*   **Children:** If the mother is granted asylum, her minor children would typically be granted derivative asylum status, provided they are unmarried and under 21.

### 2. Withholding of Removal

**Legal Standard:** This is a higher standard than asylum. The applicant must show it is ""more likely than not"" (a clear probability, >50% chance) that they would be persecuted on account of a protected ground if returned.

**Application to the Case:**
*   While the fear of future persecution is strong for asylum, proving it is ""more likely than not"" that she *will* be persecuted based on a single ransacking and one instance of surveillance, without direct threats or a pattern of escalating incidents, is significantly more challenging.
*   The lack of direct threats or further incidents *after* the initial events makes it harder to meet this higher burden of proof, although it's not impossible depending on how an adjudicator weighs the context of challenging a powerful military.

### 3. Relief Under the Convention Against Torture (CAT)

**Legal Standard:** The applicant must show it is ""more likely than not"" that they would be tortured if removed to their home country. Torture is defined as severe physical or mental pain or suffering intentionally inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.

**Application to the Case:**
*   **Definition of Torture:** The ransacking of a home and surveillance, while intimidating and distressing, do not typically rise to the level of ""torture"" as defined by CAT (severe physical or mental pain/suffering).
*   **Likelihood of Future Torture:** It would be very difficult to prove that it is ""more likely than not"" that she would be subjected to *torture* specifically, rather than other forms of persecution or harm, based on the facts provided. The incidents described do not directly suggest a high probability of torture.

### Conclusion:

The Mexican citizen and her minor children would have the strongest case for **asylum based on a well-founded fear of future persecution** due to her political opinion and the retaliatory actions (ransacking, surveillance) by or with the acquiescence of the Mexican Navy. A claim for past persecution is also plausible.

Claims for withholding of removal and CAT relief would be considerably more difficult to win given the higher evidentiary standards and the specific definitions of ""persecution"" (for withholding) and ""torture"" (for CAT). The incidents described, while serious, do not clearly meet the ""more likely than not"" standard for severe physical or mental pain constituting torture.",[],,0.8465571403503418,15.253049180327867,29.164901639344293

"An individual, Mr. Rodriguez, is a long-time lawful permanent resident of the U.S. who has a final order of removal. After the initial 90-day statutory removal period, he is detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for an additional 10 months. During this prolonged detention, he alleges that federal immigration officials, knowing that his removal to his home country was not possible and that he was ineligible for removal to a third country, made false statements in official documents to justify his continued detention. Mr. Rodriguez seeks monetary damages against these federal officials under a *Bivens* action, claiming violations of his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights for unreasonable seizure and prolonged detention without due process. Can Mr. Rodriguez pursue a *Bivens* action for damages against the federal immigration officials under these circumstances?","No, Mr. Rodriguez cannot pursue a *Bivens* action for damages against the federal immigration officials for unconstitutionally prolonged detention under these circumstances, although federal courts do have subject matter jurisdiction to hear such a claim.

The court finds that claims challenging prolonged detention after the 90-day removal period, based on allegations that officials knew removal was impossible and prolonged detention for other reasons, do not ""arise from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders"" under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g).

Congress's frequent amendments to the INA without providing a damages remedy suggests a deliberate omission. The absence of monetary relief within this statutory scheme is not a sufficient reason to create a new *Bivens* remedy. Additionally, several ""special factors"" counsel against extending *Bivens* into this context: the breadth and detail of the INA itself, the importance of demonstrating due respect for the Constitution's separation of powers (Congress's power over naturalization and the Executive's role in foreign relations), and the doctrinal novelty and administrative difficulty of such a claim, which could lead to widespread litigation and potentially chill robust enforcement of immigration laws.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['santiago alvarez v. us immigration and customs enforcement', 'alvarez v. holder', 'united states v.', 'garcia uranga v. us citizenship & immigration services', 'webster v. doe', 'demore v. kim', 'mirmehdi v. united states', 'gupta v. mcgahey', 'ashcroft v. iqbal', 'bivens v. six unknown named agents of federal bureau of narcotics', 'carlson v. green', 'davis v. passman', 'de la paz v. coy', 'minneci v. pollard', 'wilkie v. robbins', 'zadvydas v. davis', 'arizona v. united states', 'lincoln v. vigil', 'doe', 'heck v. humphrey', 'reno v. flores', 'spencer v. kemna']",[],[],0,0,0,"No, Mr. Rodriguez cannot pursue a *Bivens* action for damages against the federal immigration officials for unconstitutionally prolonged detention under these circumstances, although federal courts do have subject matter jurisdiction to hear such a claim.

Here's why, based on the Supreme Court's increasingly restrictive interpretation of *Bivens* actions:

1.  **The *Bivens* Framework is Severely Limited:**
    The Supreme Court has made it clear that *Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents* (1971) — which created an implied cause of action for damages against federal officials for constitutional violations — is a ""relic"" and should not be extended to new contexts. The Court's decisions in *Ziglar v. Abbasi* (2017) and *Hernandez v. Mesa* (2020) established a two-step inquiry:
    *   **Step 1: Is this a ""new context""?** A context is ""new"" if it is ""different in a meaningful way"" from the three original *Bivens* cases (Fourth Amendment unreasonable search and seizure, Fifth Amendment gender discrimination in employment, Eighth Amendment inadequate medical care in prison).
    *   **Step 2: Are there ""special factors counselling hesitation"" against extending *Bivens* to this new context?** If so, the Court must refrain from creating a new *Bivens* remedy.

2.  **Applying the Framework to Mr. Rodriguez's Case:**

    *   **Step 1: New Context?**
        Yes, Mr. Rodriguez's claims present a new context.
        *   **Fourth Amendment (unreasonable seizure/prolonged detention):** While the original *Bivens* case involved a Fourth Amendment claim, it concerned an illegal search and seizure by federal narcotics agents in a criminal context. Mr. Rodriguez's claim involves prolonged detention of a lawful permanent resident *after* a final order of removal, by immigration officials, based on allegations of false statements to justify continued detention when removal is impossible. This is meaningfully different in terms of the government actors, the nature of the detention, the legal framework (immigration vs. criminal), and the specific allegations.
        *   **Fifth Amendment (prolonged detention without due process):** The original Fifth Amendment *Bivens* case (*Davis v. Passman*) involved gender discrimination in employment. Mr. Rodriguez's claim relates to due process in the context of immigration detention, which is vastly different.

    *   **Step 2: Special Factors Counselling Hesitation?**
        This is where Mr. Rodriguez's claim faces insurmountable hurdles. Several special factors counsel hesitation:
        *   **Alternative Remedial Scheme: Habeas Corpus.** The most significant factor is the existence of an alternative, comprehensive remedial scheme for challenging the legality of detention in the immigration context. Mr. Rodriguez could have, and presumably did or could have, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 to challenge his prolonged detention, arguing that his removal was not reasonably foreseeable. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the availability of habeas corpus is a ""special factor"" that precludes a *Bivens* remedy for claims related to detention.
        *   **Comprehensive Statutory Scheme for Immigration:** Congress has enacted a vast and intricate statutory scheme governing immigration, including detention, removal, and judicial review. Creating a *Bivens* remedy in this area would intrude upon Congress's role in defining immigration policy and enforcement, and could disrupt the carefully balanced system it has created.
        *   **Judicial Deference to Congress in Immigration Matters:** Courts generally defer to Congress in matters of immigration, which are considered to be within the plenary power of the political branches.
        *   **Risk of Chilling Government Action:** Allowing damages actions against immigration officials for decisions related to detention could unduly deter officials from performing their duties in a sensitive area of executive power.

**Conclusion:**

Given that Mr. Rodriguez's claims arise in a ""new context"" and that ""special factors counselling hesitation"" are overwhelmingly present (especially the availability of habeas corpus and the comprehensive nature of immigration law), a federal court would almost certainly decline to create a new *Bivens* cause of action for monetary damages. While Mr. Rodriguez's allegations of false statements and prolonged detention are serious and raise potential constitutional concerns, the Supreme Court has made it clear that *Bivens* is not the appropriate vehicle for seeking damages in such circumstances. His primary avenue for relief would have been through a habeas corpus petition to challenge the legality of his detention.",[],,0.8281592130661011,14.235424430641821,24.863802622498298

Furthermore, the court would decline to consider any new arguments, such as an alternative particular social group based on family status, challenges to policy changes, or the sufficiency of their initial Notices to Appear, because these arguments were not presented to the BIA and thus not administratively exhausted, as required by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(d)(1). Defects in the initial Notice to Appear regarding the date and time of the initial hearing do not affect the IJ's or BIA's jurisdiction.","Given the facts presented, the likely outcome of a petition for review to the Fifth Circuit regarding the asylum and withholding of removal claims would be an **affirmance of the BIA's decision and a denial of the petition for review.** Any new arguments attempted to be raised on review would almost certainly be **barred by the doctrine of administrative exhaustion.**

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1.  **Rejection of ""Honduran Business Owners"" as a Particular Social Group (PSG):**
    *   **BIA Precedent:** The BIA and federal courts, including the Fifth Circuit, have consistently held that groups defined solely by their economic status or general vulnerability to criminal activity (like gang extortion for money) do not typically constitute a valid Particular Social Group under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).
    *   **PSG Requirements:** To be a valid PSG, a group must generally be:
        1.  **Composed of members sharing an immutable characteristic:** While one's past status as a business owner might be immutable, the status itself is generally not considered immutable (one can cease to be a business owner). More importantly, the *reason* for persecution is key.
        2.  **Defined with particularity:** ""Honduran business owners"" is quite broad.
        3.  **Socially distinct within the society in question:** While business owners are a recognizable group, they are not typically seen as distinct in a way that triggers persecution *on account of* that status, as opposed to being targets of generalized crime.
    *   **""On Account Of"" Nexus:** The critical flaw in this claim is the ""on account of"" nexus. Gang extortion, while horrific, is generally considered to be motivated by economic gain (i.e., the gangs want money) rather than by the victims' membership in a protected social group. The persecution is not ""on account of"" their status as business owners, but ""on account of"" their perceived wealth or ability to pay. The BIA and courts have repeatedly distinguished between generalized crime/economic hardship and persecution on account of a protected ground.
    *   **Fifth Circuit Review:** The Fifth Circuit reviews the BIA's legal interpretations of the INA (like the definition of a PSG) with deference to the BIA's expertise, especially under the *Chevron* doctrine. Given the strong precedent against recognizing PSGs based solely on economic status or vulnerability to generalized criminal extortion, the Fifth Circuit would be highly likely to uphold the BIA's rejection of ""Honduran business owners"" as a valid PSG.

2.  **Outcome for Asylum and Withholding of Removal Claims:**
    *   Since the asylum and withholding claims are predicated entirely on membership in the rejected ""Honduran business owners"" PSG, and no alternative grounds were raised, the rejection of this PSG means the applicants cannot establish eligibility for either form of relief.
    *   Therefore, the Fifth Circuit would affirm the BIA's denial of asylum and withholding of removal.

3.  **New Arguments Attempted on Review (Administrative Exhaustion):**
    *   **The Doctrine:** Federal courts, including the Fifth Circuit, strictly enforce the doctrine of administrative exhaustion in immigration cases. This means that an argument or claim for relief must have been raised before the BIA for the federal court to have jurisdiction to review it. The purpose is to give the administrative agency (BIA) the first opportunity to consider and rule on the issue.
    *   **Application:** The prompt explicitly states that the couple ""do not raise any alternative particular social groups or challenge the sufficiency of their initial Notice to Appear.""
    *   **Likely Outcome:** Any new PSG (e.g., ""persons who resist gang extortion,"" ""family members of business owners targeted by gangs,"" ""members of a specific political group"") or any challenge to the NTA's sufficiency that was not presented to the BIA would be deemed unexhausted. The Fifth Circuit would refuse to consider these new arguments, dismissing them for lack of jurisdiction.

**In summary:** The couple's petition for review would face an uphill battle, and given the facts, it is highly probable that the Fifth Circuit would affirm the BIA's decision to deny asylum and withholding of removal, and would not entertain any new arguments not previously raised before the BIA.",[],,0.814600408,15.225896656534953,30.976263736263775

"An undocumented immigrant, Mr. Garcia, received a Notice to Appear (NTA) from the Department of Homeland Security in 2020 that charged him with removability but did not specify the date or time of his initial hearing. Mr. Garcia applied for cancellation of removal, arguing that his U.S. citizen child, who suffers from a severe, rare medical condition requiring ongoing specialized treatment, would face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if he were removed. He also sought administrative closure while pursuing a U visa. The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied cancellation of removal, finding Mr. Garcia failed to establish the requisite hardship and good moral character, and did not rule on the motion for administrative closure. On appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), Mr. Garcia argued the NTA was deficient, depriving the agency of jurisdiction or, alternatively, constituting a claim-processing error. He also challenged the IJ's hardship finding and reiterated his request for administrative closure. After the BIA dismissed his appeal, his U visa application was denied, and he was subsequently removed. Can Mr. Garcia successfully challenge the BIA's decision regarding the NTA deficiency, the hardship finding for cancellation of removal, or the denial of administrative closure?","No, Mr. Garcia cannot successfully challenge the BIA's decision on these grounds.
1.  **NTA Deficiency:** The omission of time and place information from a Notice to Appear (NTA) does not deprive the Immigration Judge of subject-matter jurisdiction over removal proceedings. Furthermore, an objection to a noncompliant NTA is a claim-processing rule that is waived or forfeited if not timely raised by the closing of pleadings before the IJ.
2.  **Exceptional Hardship for Cancellation of Removal:** While the application of the ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" standard is a mixed question of law and fact reviewable by the court, the agency's underlying factual findings are unreviewable. Taking the agency's factual findings as conclusive (unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary), such as the availability of transportation for medical appointments, sufficient involvement by the other parent, and adequate financial support, the agency did not err in determining that Mr. Garcia's removal would not result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his qualifying relative. The agency's no-hardship finding is dispositive, making it unnecessary to reach any flaws in a moral-character analysis.
3.  **Administrative Closure:** Mr. Garcia's claim that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion for administrative closure or a continuance has been mooted by the denial of his U visa application and his subsequent removal from the United States, as it is impossible for the court to grant him any effectual relief.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', '')]","['sustaita-cordova v. garland', 'campos v. united states', 'niz-chavez v. garland', 'pereira v. sessions', 'rodriguez v. garland', 'garland v. ming dai', 'hernandez-castillo v. sessions', 'fuentes-pena v. barr', 'mendoza-flores v. rosen', 'nkenglefac v. garland', 'patel v. garland', 'castillo-gutierrez v. garland', 'wilkinson v. garland', 'carreon v. garland', 'saenz v. garland', 'ins v. bagamasbad', 'maniar v. garland', 'jimenez-rodriguez v. garland', 'meza morales v. barr', 'meridor v. u.s. atty gen.', 'hernandez v. garland 6th cir.', 'guerrero-lasprilla v. barr']",[],"[{'title': 'Long v.

"A private non-profit agency, ""Hope for New Arrivals,"" contracts with the state of ""Frontierland"" to provide social services to refugees using federal funds under a program similar to the Refugee Act. Frontierland's governor, citing unsubstantiated security concerns that refugees from ""Warlordia"" may pose a terrorist threat, instructs the state to withhold reimbursement for services provided by Hope for New Arrivals to any refugee whose country of origin is Warlordia. Federal law, similar to 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(5), mandates that services funded under this program be provided ""without regard to race, religion, nationality, sex, or political opinion."" Hope for New Arrivals sues to prevent the state from withholding funds. Should the court grant a preliminary injunction in favor of Hope for New Arrivals?","Yes, the court should grant the preliminary injunction. The federal law dictates that services funded under the refugee assistance program must be provided ""without regard to race, religion, nationality, sex, or political opinion."" The governor's policy of refusing to reimburse for services to refugees from a specific country, even if purportedly based on security fears, constitutes discrimination on the basis of nationality, which is explicitly forbidden by the federal statute. The governor's fears are presented without evidence and are deemed ""nightmare speculation,"" and state action cannot override federal responsibility for immigration and refugee regulation.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]",['exodus refugee immigration in v. michael pence'],"[{'title': 'U.S. Code Title 8 Section 1522', 'chunk': '**Section 412 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1522)**\n(As added Pub.

Frontierland's governor instructed the state to withhold payments. These payments were for services provided to refugees from Warlordia. This decision was based solely on the refugees' country of origin.

However, federal law mandates that services funded under this program must be provided. They must be given without regard to a person's nationality. The state's action directly violates this clear federal requirement.

Hope for New Arrivals is a non-profit agency. It contracts with the state to deliver these services. The state's refusal to reimburse for services based on nationality is unlawful.

**General Principle for Fifth Circuit Review:**
It's crucial to understand that federal courts of appeals, including the Fifth Circuit, have **limited jurisdiction** to review many discretionary decisions made by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and Immigration Judges (IJs). Specifically, INA § 242(a)(2)(B) generally bars judicial review of any decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under Title II of the INA to be in their discretion, other than the granting of relief under sections 208(a), 240B, 240A(a), and 240A(b)(1) (which are still subject to other jurisdictional bars). This means that while the court can review questions of law or constitutional claims, it generally cannot second-guess the BIA's factual findings or its exercise of discretion.

---

**1. Cancellation of Removal based on ""Exceptional and Extremely Unusual Hardship"":**

*   **Legal Standard:** To qualify for cancellation of removal under INA § 240A(b)(1), an individual must demonstrate, among other things, that removal would result in ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" to a qualifying relative (U.S. citizen or LPR spouse, parent, or child). This is a very high standard.
*   **BIA's Role:** The BIA makes the factual determination and applies the legal standard to the specific circumstances of the case.
*   **Fifth Circuit's Likely Outcome:** The Fifth Circuit will almost certainly **find that it lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA's determination** that the petitioner failed to establish ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.""
    *   The determination of whether a petitioner has met the ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" standard is considered a **discretionary factual finding** by the BIA.
    *   The Fifth Circuit consistently holds that it lacks jurisdiction under INA § 242(a)(2)(B)(i) to review the BIA's discretionary decision regarding whether a petitioner has established the requisite hardship for cancellation of removal.
    *   The court would only have jurisdiction if the petitioner were raising a pure question of law (e.g., the BIA applied the wrong legal standard entirely) or a constitutional claim, neither of which is explicitly indicated by the prompt's description of the hardship argument. Arguments about the *degree* of hardship (emotional, psychological, medical, financial impacts) fall squarely within the BIA's discretionary fact-finding.

---

**2. Denial of Voluntary Departure due to ""Tax Fraud"" (Inconsistencies):**

*   **Legal Standard:** Voluntary departure under INA § 240B is a discretionary form of relief. The BIA considers various factors, including eligibility, good moral character, and any adverse factors. ""Tax fraud"" or significant inconsistencies in tax filings are serious adverse factors that can weigh heavily against a grant of voluntary departure.
*   **BIA's Role:** The BIA exercises its discretion in granting or denying voluntary departure, weighing all positive and negative factors.
*   **Fifth Circuit's Likely Outcome:** The Fifth Circuit will almost certainly **find that it lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA's discretionary denial** of voluntary departure.
    *   The decision to grant or deny voluntary departure is explicitly a **discretionary decision** of the Attorney General (delegated to the BIA).
    *   Under INA § 242(a)(2)(B)(i), courts of appeals generally lack jurisdiction to review such discretionary decisions.
    *   The BIA's finding of ""inconsistencies"" referred to as ""tax fraud"" provides a rational basis for the discretionary denial, making it highly unlikely the Fifth Circuit would find a reviewable legal error or constitutional violation.

---

**3. Denial of Motion for Continuance to Await Parents' LPR Status:**

*   **Legal Standard:** Motions for continuance are highly discretionary procedural decisions made by the Immigration Judge and reviewed by the BIA for abuse of discretion. They are generally granted only for ""good cause.""
*   **BIA's Role:** The BIA reviews the IJ's denial of a continuance under an ""abuse of discretion"" standard. The BIA itself has broad discretion in managing its docket and the proceedings.
*   **Fifth Circuit's Likely Outcome:** The Fifth Circuit is **unlikely to overturn the BIA's denial** of the motion for continuance.
    *   While denials of motions for continuance *can* be reviewed by federal courts for ""abuse of discretion,"" this is a very deferential standard. The BIA's decision must be ""arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law"" to be overturned.
    *   The BIA typically considers factors such as the likelihood of the event occurring (parents obtaining LPR status), the potential for undue delay in proceedings, and whether the petitioner had other opportunities to present their case.
    *   Given that the parents' LPR status was still pending and thus speculative, the BIA likely found that granting a continuance would cause undue delay without a sufficiently certain benefit. The Fifth Circuit would likely defer to the BIA's judgment that the denial was not an abuse of discretion. It is very rare for the Fifth Circuit to reverse a BIA decision on a motion for continuance unless there is a clear showing of arbitrariness or a fundamental procedural error.

---

**In Summary:**

The petitioner faces significant hurdles in the Fifth Circuit. For the cancellation of removal and voluntary departure issues, the court will almost certainly conclude it lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA's discretionary decisions. For the motion to continue, while reviewable for abuse of discretion, the Fifth Circuit is highly deferential to the BIA, making a reversal unlikely.

Here's the primary legal reasoning:

### I. Asylum and Withholding of Removal (Particular Social Group)

The core issue for asylum and withholding of removal is whether the proposed particular social groups (PSGs) meet the legal definition.

1.  **Failure to Meet PSG Requirements:**
    *   **Precedent (Matter of A-B-):** The BIA's landmark decision in *Matter of A-B-*, particularly its second iteration in 2021, significantly narrowed the scope of domestic violence-based asylum claims. It held that ""victims of private criminal activity"" generally do not constitute a particular social group. The BIA emphasized that a PSG cannot be defined by the persecution itself or by a shared vulnerability to criminal activity.
    *   **Specific PSGs:**
        *   **""Salvadoran women in domestic relationships who are unable to leave"":** This group is likely to be rejected because it is defined primarily by the harm suffered (being ""unable to leave"" due to abuse) rather than by an immutable, pre-existing characteristic. It also lacks the requisite ""particularity"" (how is ""unable to leave"" objectively defined?) and ""social visibility/cohesion"" (is this group recognized as distinct by Salvadoran society?).
        *   **""Salvadoran women who are viewed as property by virtue of their position in a domestic relationship"":** Similar to the above, this group is defined by the perception and dynamics of the abusive relationship, which is a consequence of the persecution, not an inherent characteristic that defines a social group. It also struggles with particularity and social visibility.
    *   **Fifth Circuit Precedent:** The Fifth Circuit generally defers to the BIA's interpretation of asylum law unless it is ""manifestly contrary to the statute."" The Fifth Circuit has consistently upheld the principles of *Matter of A-B-* and has been reluctant to recognize PSGs based on generalized vulnerability to private criminal activity, even if gender-based. They require a clear nexus between the persecution and membership in a *cognizable* social group, not merely a group defined by the persecution itself.

2.  **Nexus and Government Action:**
    *   Even if a PSG were recognized, the applicant would still need to demonstrate that the persecution was ""on account of"" her membership in that group and that the Salvadoran government was unable or unwilling to protect her. While the claim alleges government inability, the primary hurdle remains the PSG definition itself. If the PSG fails, the nexus argument becomes moot for asylum and withholding.

### II. Convention Against Torture (CAT)

Protection under CAT has a different standard than asylum or withholding of removal.

1.  **High Bar for ""Acquiescence"":**
    *   To qualify for CAT protection, the applicant must demonstrate that it is ""more likely than not"" that she would be tortured if removed to El Salvador. Crucially, this torture must be inflicted by or at the instigation of, or with the consent or acquiescence of, a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.
    *   **""Acquiescence"" Standard:** The Fifth Circuit (and BIA) interprets ""acquiescence"" strictly. It requires more than just a government's general inability to control crime or a general failure to protect its citizens. It requires that a public official is *aware* of the torture and *consents* to it or is *willfully blind* to it.
    *   **Application:** While the abuse from her ex-partner is severe, proving that the Salvadoran government (through its officials) would *acquiesce* to her ex-partner's torture is extremely difficult. General police inaction, corruption, or a dysfunctional justice system, while problematic, often do not rise to the level of ""acquiescence"" under CAT, especially when the persecutor is a private actor. The applicant would need to show specific evidence that public officials would be aware of her specific torture and then condone or ignore it.

### Conclusion

The Fifth Circuit will likely affirm the BIA's denial because:

1.  The proposed particular social groups for asylum and withholding of removal are unlikely to meet the legal requirements of particularity, social visibility/cohesion, and immutability, especially in light of *Matter of A-B-* and Fifth Circuit precedent, which disfavors PSGs defined by the persecution itself.
2.  The claim for CAT protection is unlikely to meet the high standard of proving government ""acquiescence"" to torture by a private actor.",[],,0.8272441625595093,15.504221757322181,26.473571129707125

His immigration attorneys inform him that his conviction makes him ineligible for cancellation of removal and permanently inadmissible to the U.S., which he alleges his trial counsel failed to clearly explain. His Motion for Appropriate Relief (MAR) for ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC) under *Padilla v. Kentucky*, and for his plea not being knowingly and voluntarily entered, is initially denied.

Kentucky*.

Here's the likely reasoning:

1.  **Misapplication of the Prejudice Prong under *Padilla v. Kentucky***:
    *   The trial court's conclusion that there was no prejudice because the defendant was ""already subject to deportation due to his undocumented status"" fundamentally misunderstands the nature of prejudice in the context of *Padilla* and *Strickland v. Washington*.
    *   **Deportability vs. Ineligibility for Relief:** While being undocumented makes an individual *deportable*, many undocumented individuals are *eligible for forms of relief from removal* (such as cancellation of removal for non-permanent residents, asylum, DACA, etc.) that could prevent actual deportation.
    *   **The Harm Caused by the Plea:** The defendant's plea to reduced drug charges, as his immigration attorneys explained, made him **ineligible for cancellation of removal** and **permanently inadmissible** to the U.S. This is a *direct, severe, and additional immigration consequence* that was *caused by the plea itself*, not merely by his prior undocumented status.
    *   **Prejudice Defined:** For prejudice under *Strickland/Padilla*, the defendant must show a ""reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial."" The fact that he was already deportable does not negate the possibility that, had he been properly advised of the *specific and severe consequences* of the plea (i.e., losing all avenues for relief), he might have chosen to risk trial to preserve his eligibility for such relief.

2.  **The Significance of Losing Eligibility for Relief:**
    *   For an individual who has been in the U.S. since age seven, cancellation of removal for non-permanent residents (8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)) is a critical potential avenue for relief. This relief typically requires 10 years of continuous physical presence, good moral character, and a showing of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. A drug conviction, especially for certain offenses, can be a disqualifying factor for ""good moral character"" and can make an individual inadmissible, thereby eliminating eligibility for this and other forms of relief.
    *   The trial court's reasoning effectively ignores the profound difference between being deportable (but potentially eligible for relief) and being deportable *and* having all avenues for relief foreclosed by a criminal conviction.

3.  **The ""Knowingly and Voluntarily"" Aspect:**
    *   A plea is not knowingly and voluntarily entered if the defendant is not adequately informed of its direct consequences, including the immigration consequences as mandated by *Padilla*. If trial counsel failed to clearly explain that the plea would make him permanently inadmissible and ineligible for relief, then the plea was not truly knowing and voluntary regarding these critical consequences.

**Conclusion:**

"Maya was arrested and held in the Smith County Jail on state misdemeanor charges. After posting bond for these charges, she was eligible for release. However, the Smith County Sheriff continued to detain Maya based on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer and an administrative arrest warrant (Form I-200) for civil immigration violations. The Smith County Sheriff's office has an active 287(g) agreement with ICE, authorizing its deputies to perform specific immigration enforcement functions. Maya's legal counsel filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in state superior court, arguing that her continued detention by the Sheriff was unlawful because the federal detainer lacked probable cause and the Sheriff lacked state authority to detain her for civil immigration purposes. The petition explicitly mentioned the Sheriff's 287(g) agreement. Should the state superior court grant Maya's request for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus and order her discharge?","No, the state superior court should deny Maya's request for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus and her discharge.

The application, by explicitly stating that Maya is being held pursuant to an immigration detainer and I-200 Form, and acknowledging the Sheriff's 287(g) agreement, informs the state court that its state law authority to inquire into the lawfulness of the detention is superseded by federal law. A state court lacks the power to look behind the Sheriff's claim that the petitioner is being held pursuant to a valid immigration-related process under a 287(g) agreement, as the Sheriff is acting as a de facto immigration officer in such circumstances.

Challenges to the validity of the immigration process itself are reserved for federal, not state, judicial officials.","Yes, the state superior court **should grant Maya's request for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus and order her discharge.**

Here's the breakdown of the reasoning:

1.  **Review of Federal Probable Cause for Detainer/I-200:**
    *   **State Court Jurisdiction:** State courts generally lack the authority to review the *substantive* probable cause underlying a federal immigration detainer or an administrative arrest warrant (Form I-200). These are federal administrative determinations, and challenges to their merits typically belong in federal court.
    *   **Nature of Detainers:** ICE detainers are requests, not judicial warrants, and are based on administrative probable cause, not the Fourth Amendment's criminal probable cause standard. Form I-200 is an administrative warrant, not a judicial warrant issued by a neutral magistrate.
    *   Therefore, the state superior court would likely **not** rule on Maya's argument that the federal detainer itself lacks probable cause.

2.  **Sheriff's State Authority to Detain for Civil Immigration Purposes:**
    *   **General Principle:** State and local law enforcement agencies generally lack inherent authority to enforce federal civil immigration law. Immigration enforcement is primarily a federal responsibility.
    *   **The 287(g) Agreement:** While the Smith County Sheriff's office has an active 287(g) agreement, this is the critical point of analysis.
        *   A 287(g) agreement deputizes *specifically trained* state or local officers to perform *certain* federal immigration enforcement functions. It grants them *federal* authority to act as immigration officers for those specific functions.
        *   **However, a 287(g) agreement does not, by itself, create or expand a state or local officer's *state law authority* to make an arrest or detention.** State and local officers must still have a basis under *state law* to make an arrest or detention.
    *   **Lack of State Statutory Authority:** In many states, there is no specific state statute that authorizes local law enforcement (like a sheriff) to arrest or detain an individual *solely* based on an ICE detainer or an administrative warrant (like Form I-200) after the individual has satisfied their state criminal charges (e.g., by posting bond).
        *   ICE detainers are considered *requests* for continued detention, not judicial warrants that compel detention under state law.
        *   An administrative warrant (I-200) is also not a judicial warrant issued by a state court judge or magistrate, which would typically be required for a new arrest or detention under state law.
    *   **Precedent:** Numerous state courts across the country (e.g., in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Oregon, Illinois, etc.) have ruled that state and local law enforcement agencies lack state statutory authority to detain individuals solely on the basis of an ICE detainer after state charges have been resolved, even when a 287(g) agreement is in place. These courts have found that such detentions exceed the scope of the local agency's state-granted powers.

**Conclusion:**

While the state superior court would likely not delve into the merits of the federal probable cause for the detainer/I-200, it **would** likely find that the Smith County Sheriff lacks the necessary *state law authority* to continue detaining Maya solely based on the ICE detainer and administrative warrant after she posted bond for her state charges. The 287(g) agreement grants federal authority for specific tasks, but it does not create a state law basis for detention that otherwise doesn't exist.

Therefore, Maya's continued detention by the Sheriff is unlawful under state law, making a writ of habeas corpus the appropriate remedy to secure her discharge.",[],,0.8355215191841125,14.346862385321106,31.03093577981653

"A foreign investor seeks an EB-5 visa through a regional center, proposing to invest $500,000 in a new commercial enterprise (NCE) that will loan funds to multiple job-creating entities (JCEs) for various mining projects in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA). At the time of filing the Form I-526 petition, the investor's business plan and offering memorandum list four potential mining locations, but explicitly state that not all have been formally approved, and alternative or additional projects are unspecified and unapproved if initial projects fall through or require less funding. The plan includes an economic report projecting job creation based on mining expenditures but without specific JCE locations. USCIS denies the petition, citing failure to establish TEA qualification and job creation at the time of filing, and views subsequent clarification of JCE locations as an impermissible material change. Can the investor successfully challenge this denial, arguing that the NCE was clearly intended to operate in a TEA and that their economic report adequately demonstrated job creation potential, irrespective of specific JCE locations at filing?","No, the investor cannot successfully challenge the denial. A U.S. District Court has upheld USCIS's denial of similar EB-5 visa petitions on two independent grounds: (1) failure to establish that the Job Creating Entities (JCEs) were principally doing business in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA) at the time of filing, and (2) failure to establish that the investments would create full-time positions for at least ten qualifying employees at the time of filing. For regional center investments, the ""principally doing business"" requirement applies to the JCEs, not the New Commercial Enterprise (NCE). The Court found it reasonable for USCIS to conclude that the investor failed to meet the TEA requirement because the JCEs were not fully identified or approved at the time of filing, making it impossible to determine if the $500,000 TEA investment threshold was met. Furthermore, changes to JCE locations after filing were deemed impermissible material changes affecting eligibility. Regarding job creation, the Court found that the initial business plan, lacking specified JCE locations, was not sufficiently comprehensive to support a credible economic analysis for prospective job creation at the time of filing. USCIS could not assess the reasonableness of assumptions about the geographic impact of projects without this information.

2.  **Prejudice to Health, Welfare, and Other Interests:** Devani's alleged financial and immigration-related harms (uncertainty) are considered inherent risks of the I-526 application process and do not rise to the level of harm, such as significant threats to physical health or safety, typically warranting intervention under these factors.
3.  **Agency's Competing Priorities:** Granting relief would require USCIS to reorder its priorities, placing Devani ahead of other similarly situated petitioners in the existing backlog, which the court is hesitant to do.

What are the legal obligations of the sponsor regarding the Affidavit of Support, including the relevant household size and income calculations, and what remedies are available for the loan and fees?","The trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the Affidavit of Support claims for all relevant years, as the plaintiff's prayer for relief covered all damages. However, the trial court erred by calculating damages using the 125% Federal Poverty Level (FPL) Guidelines for a two-person household; it should have used the guidelines for a one-person household, as the child was a U.S. citizen and not a sponsored alien. The trial court did not err by calculating the sponsored immigrant's income using Adjusted Gross Income, allowing for the deduction of depreciation expenses.

Regarding the personal loan, the defendant's argument that an implied-in-fact contract existed (instead of a quasi-contract) was waived because it contradicted their position at trial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not crediting the defendant for ""sweat equity"" on other properties when fashioning the equitable remedy for the loan used to purchase the income-producing property. The trial court did err by awarding repayment of the loan in U.S. Dollars (USD) instead of Australian Dollars (AUD); the award must be converted to AUD on remand.

The trial court's decision to hold an additional conference before the final order was entered, and any missing portions of the trial transcript, did not constitute reversible error because the defendant failed to show prejudice. Finally, the trial court did not err by awarding reasonable attorney's fees to the immigrant spouse for prevailing on her Affidavit of Support claims, though the amount may be reconsidered on remand due to the reduction in damages owed.","[('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('cfr', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', ''), ('usc', '8', '')]","['pelc v. pham', 'mckoy v. mckoy', 'suozzo v. suozzo', 'zhu v. deng', 'martin v. n.c. dept. of health & human servs.', 'anderson v. anderson', 'barnett v. barnett', 'erler v. erler erler i', 'wenfang liu v. mund', 'younis v. farooqi', 'flores v. flores', 'n.c. ins. guar. assn v. weathersfield mgmt.', 'erler v. erler erler ii', 'villars v. villars', 'tohato inc. v. pinewild mgmt.', 'state v. sharpe', 'weil v. herring', 'kinlaw v. harris', 'bartlett milling co. v. walnut grove auction & realty']","[{'title': 'U.S. Code Title 8 Section 1183a', 'chunk': 'This summary pertains to 8 U.S.C. 1183a, titled ""Requirements for sponsor’s affidavit of support.""\nThe section 213A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (which is 8 U.S.C. 1183a) was added by Pub.

Garland*, the Honduran woman's petitions for asylum and related relief would likely **not** be granted, at least not on the grounds presented for the particular social group and the due process claims.

Here's a breakdown of why, referencing the key holdings of *Bustamante-Leiva*:

1.  **Proposed Particular Social Group (PSG):**
    *   The proposed PSG, ""unprotected Honduran women who are unable to protect themselves or their children from Honduran gangs,"" is very similar to the PSG rejected in *Bustamante-Leiva*.
    *   In *Bustamante-Leiva*, the Ninth Circuit found that a PSG defined by the inability to avoid harm (e.g., ""Honduran women who are unable to protect themselves or their children from domestic violence and gang violence"") is not cognizable. Such a group lacks the requisite particularity and social distinction, and essentially defines a group by its vulnerability to general crime rather than a shared immutable characteristic.
    *   Therefore, based on *Bustamante-Leiva*, this PSG would likely be found not to be a cognizable particular social group, significantly undermining the asylum claim based on this ground.

2.  **Religious Activities Claim:**
    *   *Bustamante-Leiva* did involve a religious persecution claim. The Ninth Circuit *remanded* the case to the BIA for proper consideration of the religious claim because the BIA had failed to adequately address it.
    *   However, a remand for consideration is not a grant of asylum. *Bustamante-Leiva* does not establish that such a claim *must* be granted, only that it *must be properly adjudicated*. If the BIA in the current scenario *did* properly consider the religious claim and found it insufficient, *Bustamante-Leiva* would not provide a basis to overturn that finding unless the BIA's reasoning was flawed. The case itself does not guarantee a grant of asylum based on religious activities, only the right to a proper review.

3.  **Due Process Claims:**
    *   **Single BIA Member Decision:** *Bustamante-Leiva* explicitly rejected the argument that a single BIA member deciding a case without a three-member panel violates due process. The court affirmed that 8 C.F.R. § 1003.1(e)(5) allows a single BIA member to affirm an Immigration Judge's decision without opinion (AWO) when the BIA member determines the IJ's decision was correct and any errors were harmless or non-material. This procedure was found to be constitutional.
    *   **No Government Brief:** *Bustamante-Leiva* also rejected the argument that due process requires the government to file a brief before the BIA. The court held that the petitioner bears the burden of proof and has the opportunity to present their case, and there is no constitutional right to have the government file a brief.
    *   Therefore, these due process arguments would likely fail based on *Bustamante-Leiva*.

**Conclusion:**

Given that the proposed PSG is likely to be rejected, and the due process arguments are directly contradicted by *Bustamante-Leiva*, the overall likelihood of the petitions being granted is low. While the religious claim would require proper consideration, *Bustamante-Leiva* does not guarantee its success, only its review.",[],,0.81080693,13.604979405034328,34.305464530892465

Therefore, prejudice is not demonstrated.","This scenario presents a strong case for the defendant to successfully withdraw his guilty plea based on ineffective assistance of counsel, particularly on the showing of prejudice.

Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

**I. Legal Standard for Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (IAC) in Guilty Pleas**

To succeed on an IAC claim, a defendant must satisfy the two-pronged test established in *Strickland v. Washington*, and adapted for guilty pleas in *Hill v. Lockhart*:

1.  **Deficient Performance:** The defendant must show that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.
2.  **Prejudice:** The defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.

**II. Application to the Facts**

**A. Deficient Performance**

*   **Padilla v. Kentucky (2010):** This landmark Supreme Court case established that counsel has an affirmative duty to advise noncitizen clients about the immigration consequences of a guilty plea. When the immigration consequences are ""truly clear,"" counsel must provide direct advice. When the law is complex, counsel must advise that there may be adverse consequences and that the client should seek expert advice.
*   **Application:** The attorney's failure to advise the defendant that relief under INA Section 212(c) was *unavailable* directly falls under *Padilla*. This is a specific, critical, and likely ""truly clear"" adverse immigration consequence. Failing to inform the defendant of the *unavailability* of a specific form of relief, which would have been crucial to his decision-making, almost certainly constitutes deficient performance.
*   **R.C. 2943.031 General Advisement:** While the trial court provided a general advisement, this does not absolve counsel of their specific duty under *Padilla*. A general advisement from the court typically warns that a plea *may* have immigration consequences, but it does not provide the specific, tailored advice about the *certainty* or *severity* of those consequences for that particular defendant, especially regarding the unavailability of specific relief like 212(c).

**B. Prejudice (The Core of the Question)**

*   **Hill v. Lockhart Standard:** The defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.
*   **Lee v. United States (2017):** This Supreme Court case further clarified the prejudice prong in the immigration context. It held that even if a defendant faces overwhelming evidence of guilt and a near-certain conviction at trial, they can still show prejudice if they can credibly demonstrate that they would have rejected a plea and risked trial *solely to avoid deportation*. The Court emphasized that avoiding deportation can be a ""decisive factor"" for a noncitizen defendant.
*   **Factors Supporting Prejudice in this Case:**
    1.  **Defendant's Affidavit:** The defendant explicitly states he ""would not have pleaded guilty if he had known this."" While self-serving, this is a necessary starting point for the prejudice analysis.
    2.  **Strong Ties to the U.S.:** This factor is crucial under *Lee*. A defendant with strong ties (family, community, employment, long-term residency) has a much greater incentive to avoid deportation, making it more credible that they would have risked trial to stay in the country.
    3.  **Unavailability of 212(c) Relief:** This means the immigration consequence was not just ""adverse"" but likely *certain and severe* (i.e., deportation without a viable path to relief). This certainty of a devastating outcome makes it highly probable that the defendant would have prioritized avoiding it.
    4.  **Potential Grounds for Dismissal or Acquittal:** This is a very strong factor. Unlike *Lee*, where the defendant had virtually no chance of acquittal, this defendant had *potential grounds for dismissal or acquittal*. This means going to trial was not a futile gesture; there was a *realistic chance* of avoiding both the criminal conviction and, by extension, the deportation. This significantly bolsters the credibility of the defendant's claim that he would have gone to trial. He had a viable alternative to the plea that would have avoided the devastating immigration consequence.
    5.  **Severity of Charges:** While severe charges often push defendants to plead guilty, the combination of potential acquittal and certain deportation makes the choice to go to trial a rational one for a noncitizen prioritizing remaining in the U.S.

*   **Factors Arguing Against Prejudice (and why they are likely insufficient):**
    1.  **General R.C. 2943.031 Advisement:** As discussed, this general warning is unlikely to overcome the specific failure of counsel to advise on the *unavailability* of a critical form of relief, especially given the defendant's strong ties and potential defenses. It did not convey the *certainty* and *irreversibility* of the specific immigration consequence.

**III. Conclusion**

Given the confluence of factors – the attorney's clear failure to advise on a critical and certain immigration consequence, the defendant's strong ties to the U.S., the explicit statement that he would not have pleaded guilty, and critically, the *potential grounds for dismissal or acquittal* – the defendant's motion to withdraw the guilty plea due to ineffective assistance of counsel would **likely be granted based on a strong showing of prejudice.**

The presence of potential grounds for dismissal or acquittal distinguishes this case from situations where a defendant faces overwhelming evidence and no viable defense, making the decision to go to trial a more rational and credible choice to avoid deportation. The *Lee v. United States* precedent strongly supports the idea that avoiding deportation can be a decisive factor, and here, the defendant had a plausible path to achieve that goal by going to trial.",[],,0.8320244550704956,13.455825519771707,34.69898899306975

"An individual, a native of Tanzania, entered the U.S. on a student visa and subsequently married a U.S. citizen. This marriage was later annulled, but before the annulment, the U.S. citizen spouse filed an I-130 petition on the individual's behalf, which was later denied due to the U.S. citizen spouse's fraudulent multiple marriages. The individual then married a second U.S. citizen, claiming battery and extreme cruelty, and filed an I-360 self-petition. The USCIS and AAO denied this I-360 petition, citing the previous marriage as fraudulent under Section 204(c) and also finding a failure to prove good faith in the second marriage.

Garland*, which held that such hardship determinations are discretionary and authoritative decisions beyond federal court review.","Based on current U.S. immigration law and Supreme Court precedent, the answer to both parts of your question is generally **no**, with important nuances and limited exceptions.

Here's a breakdown:

### 1. Challenging the Validity of the NTA in Federal Court

**Generally No, as a Jurisdictional Defect:**

*   **Background:** The Supreme Court's decisions in *Pereira v. Sessions* (2018) and *Niz-Chavez v. Garland* (2021) established that a Notice to Appear (NTA) that does not specify the time and place of the initial hearing does not stop the ""continuous physical presence"" clock for purposes of eligibility for cancellation of removal. This was a significant win for immigrants seeking cancellation.
*   **The ""Jurisdictional"" Argument:** Following these decisions, many immigrants argued that an NTA lacking time and place was *jurisdictionally defective*, meaning the immigration court never had proper authority to hear the case.
*   **Supreme Court's Rejection of Jurisdictional Argument:** However, in **Garland v. Aleman-Gonzalez (2023)**, the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the argument that an NTA's failure to specify the time and place of an initial hearing deprives an immigration court of jurisdiction. The Court clarified that such a defect does not invalidate the entire removal proceeding.
*   **Implication:** This means an individual generally **cannot** challenge the validity of the NTA in federal court *solely on the basis that it initially lacked time and place as a jurisdictional defect*. The immigration court still has jurisdiction to proceed with the removal case.

**However, it can still be relevant for eligibility:**

*   While not a jurisdictional defect, the NTA's initial lack of time and place *still matters* for the **substantive eligibility** for cancellation of removal. If the NTA did not stop the continuous physical presence clock, and the individual cannot meet the 10-year physical presence requirement without the clock being stopped by a compliant NTA, then they would be ineligible for cancellation of removal.
*   **Appealing Eligibility:** A decision by the BIA regarding an individual's *eligibility* for cancellation of removal (e.g., whether they met the 10-year physical presence requirement, which hinges on the NTA's compliance with *Pereira* and *Niz-Chavez*) can be appealed to federal court as a **question of law**. Federal courts generally retain jurisdiction to review pure questions of law, even in cases where review of discretionary decisions is barred.

### 2. Appealing the BIA's Finding on Hardship

**Generally No, as a Discretionary/Factual Finding:**

*   **Statutory Bar:** The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) § 242(a)(2)(B) severely limits federal court review of certain immigration decisions. Specifically, it states that ""no court shall have jurisdiction to review... any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section... 1229b [cancellation of removal].""
*   **""Exceptional and Extremely Unusual Hardship"":** The determination of whether a qualifying relative (like a child) would suffer ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" is considered a **discretionary finding** or a **finding of fact** by the immigration judge and the BIA.
*   **Implication:** Federal courts are generally **barred** from reviewing the BIA's *factual determination* that the children would not face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. A federal court cannot reweigh the evidence presented or substitute its own judgment for that of the BIA on whether the hardship threshold was met.

**Limited Exceptions for Review:**

Federal courts *can* still review:

*   **Pure Questions of Law:** If the BIA made a legal error in interpreting the ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" standard, or applied the wrong legal standard altogether.
*   **Constitutional Claims:** If the BIA's decision violated the individual's due process rights or another constitutional protection (e.g., a complete failure to consider evidence, or a decision based on an impermissible factor).
*   **Failure to Exercise Discretion:** If the BIA failed to exercise its discretion at all, or based its decision on an improper legal premise.

**In summary:**

*   You **cannot** directly challenge the NTA in federal court as a jurisdictional defect based on its initial lack of time and place, following *Aleman-Gonzalez*. However, you **can** appeal a BIA decision regarding your *eligibility* for cancellation of removal if that eligibility hinges on whether the NTA properly stopped the continuous physical presence clock (a question of law).
*   You **cannot** appeal the BIA's *factual finding* that your children would not suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship, as this is a discretionary decision generally barred from federal court review. You **can** appeal pure questions of law or constitutional claims related to how that hardship determination was made.",[],,0.8222344517707825,15.046925549697828,25.342576400497194

Electronic communication may supplement but not replace in-person visitation.","No, it is **highly unlikely and generally outside the jurisdiction of a U.S. federal court** to issue such an order.

Here's a breakdown of why:

1.  **Jurisdiction of Federal vs. State Courts:**
    *   **Child custody matters are almost exclusively handled by state courts** (family courts). Federal courts generally abstain from domestic relations cases, even if there are diverse parties or other federal issues involved. This is known as the ""domestic relations exception"" to federal jurisdiction.
    *   A federal court's primary role is to interpret federal law, the U.S. Constitution, or handle cases between citizens of different states (diversity jurisdiction) where no state court is available or appropriate, but they typically defer to state courts on family law matters.

2.  **What a State Family Court Would Consider (if this were brought before them):**
    If this issue were brought before a state family court (which is the correct forum), the court's paramount concern would be the **""best interest of the child.""** In such a scenario, several significant factors would weigh heavily against ordering the children to travel abroad:

    *   **History/Allegations of Domestic Violence:** Even ""alleged"" domestic violence is a grave concern. Courts take such allegations very seriously, as they directly impact the safety and well-being of the children and the other parent. If there's a finding or credible evidence of domestic violence, it would be a major barrier to ordering unsupervised international travel.
    *   **Risk of International Parental Child Abduction:** This is a primary concern when ordering children to travel to a foreign country, especially when one parent has been deported and has no legal right to return to the U.S. The court would assess:
        *   Whether the foreign country is a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.
        *   The stability of the foreign country's legal system and its ability/willingness to enforce U.S. court orders.
        *   The deported parent's ties to the foreign country and any incentive they might have not to return the children.
        *   The difficulty and cost of recovering children from that country if they were not returned.
    *   **Safety Concerns of the Other Parent and Children:** The court would take the other parent's fears for her safety and the children's safety very seriously, especially given the context of alleged domestic violence.
    *   **Deportation Status:** The fact that the parent was deported due to alleged domestic violence further complicates matters and raises red flags about their character and potential risk.
    *   **Enforceability of Orders:** A U.S. court order for visitation might be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce in a foreign country, particularly if that country does not recognize or enforce U.S. family law judgments.
    *   **Child's Wishes:** Depending on their age and maturity, the children's wishes and feelings about traveling abroad to visit the deported parent would also be considered.

**Conclusion:**

A **U.S. federal court would almost certainly not have the jurisdiction** to order children to travel abroad for visitation in a custody dispute.

If this matter were before a **state family court**, it would face **significant hurdles and would be highly unlikely** to order such travel given the serious concerns about alleged domestic violence, the other parent's safety fears, and the substantial risk of international parental child abduction. The court's priority is always the safety and best interests of the children, and these factors would strongly militate against ordering them to leave the U.S. under such circumstances.",[],,0.8207669258117676,12.68856787822305,38.178648648648675
"An individual, who is a lawful permanent resident (LPR), applies for naturalization. During the review, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) discovers that the individual's original application for LPR status contained a material misrepresentation, specifically omitting a prior marriage. The individual contends that this omission was an attorney's inadvertent error, not fraudulent or willful, and that they were not otherwise inadmissible on the true facts. Based on this discovery, USCIS denies the naturalization application, concluding the individual was not ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence."" Is the individual eligible for naturalization?","No, the individual is not eligible for naturalization. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirms that an individual is not ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence"" if their application for adjustment to LPR status contained a material misrepresentation, even if the misrepresentation was not fraudulent or willful, and even if the individual believes they would not have been inadmissible on the true facts. This is because the application, containing a material misrepresentation, did not comply with 8 C.F.R. § 103.2(a)(2), which requires all information to be ""true and correct.""

Failure to be lawfully admitted for permanent residence is a statutory bar to naturalization.","No, the individual is likely **not eligible for naturalization** based on the discovery that their original LPR application contained a material misrepresentation.

Here's why:

1.  **""Lawfully Admitted for Permanent Residence"" Requirement:** A fundamental requirement for naturalization is that the applicant must have been ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence."" This means that their LPR status must have been validly obtained in the first place, free from fraud or material misrepresentation.

2.  **Impact of Material Misrepresentation:** Even if the individual was not otherwise inadmissible on the true facts, and even if the omission was an attorney's inadvertent error rather than a willful act of fraud by the applicant, the fact that the original LPR status was obtained based on a **material misrepresentation** means that the status itself was not ""lawfully obtained.""

    *   **Materiality:** A misrepresentation is generally considered ""material"" if it has a natural tendency to influence the decision of the immigration agency. Omitting a prior marriage is almost always considered material because it can affect identity, marital history, eligibility for certain visa categories (e.g., family-based petitions), and good moral character assessments.

3.  **Precedent (Matter of Koloamatangi):** The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) in *Matter of Koloamatangi*, 23 I&N Dec. 548 (BIA 2003), held that an individual is not ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence"" if their LPR status was obtained through fraud or material misrepresentation, even if they were otherwise eligible for the underlying benefit. The focus is on the *process* by which the status was obtained, not just whether the person *could have been* eligible under different circumstances.

4.  **Attorney Error vs. Applicant Responsibility:** While the individual claims attorney error, applicants are generally held responsible for the information submitted on their behalf. The intent (fraudulent or willful) is often crucial for determining *inadmissibility* under INA 212(a)(6)(C)(i) (misrepresentation), but for the ""lawfully admitted"" standard for naturalization, the *effect* of the misrepresentation on the validity of the LPR grant is paramount. If the misrepresentation was material, the LPR status was not lawfully obtained, regardless of the applicant's personal intent or the attorney's error.

**Conclusion:**

USCIS's denial is consistent with established immigration law and policy. The individual's LPR status, having been obtained through a material misrepresentation, is deemed to have been ""unlawfully admitted for permanent residence."" Therefore, they do not meet a core eligibility requirement for naturalization.

To become eligible for naturalization, the individual would first need to address the underlying defect in their LPR status, which could involve complex legal processes, potentially including seeking a waiver or even rescission of their LPR status and re-applying, depending on the specific facts and available relief.",[],,0.8549600839614868,17.338400196294938,10.970515274199471

"Can a U.S. lawful permanent resident successfully sue the U.S. State Department for unreasonable delay in processing an immigrant visa for their spouse under the Administrative Procedure Act, or for violating their Fifth Amendment due process rights, given a processing delay of under two years exacerbated by a global pandemic?","No, a U.S. lawful permanent resident cannot successfully sue the U.S. State Department for unreasonable delay or Fifth Amendment due process violations under these circumstances.

The Court dismissed the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claim for unreasonable delay because:
1.  The State Department's practice of processing visa applications on a first-in, first-out basis is considered a ""rule of reason"" for decision-making, and Congress has not established a specific statutory timetable for visa processing.
2.  A delay of approximately fourteen months (less than two years) is not deemed unreasonable as a matter of law, especially given the extraordinary backlog of cases (increasing from approximately 75,000 to 473,000) and the disruption to services caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.
3.  Granting relief would place the plaintiff ahead of other similarly situated applicants, interfering with the State Department's allocation of resources and its prioritization of ""mission critical"" functions during the pandemic.
4.  The plaintiff's broad allegations regarding the delay's toll on his physical and mental health and the harm to his family were insufficient to meet the criteria for human health and welfare or other interests prejudiced by the delay.
5.  No impropriety or bad faith on the part of the agency was alleged.
Consequently, the mandamus action based on the APA claim also failed.

The Court dismissed the Fifth Amendment due process claims (both substantive and procedural) because:
1.  There is no fundamental liberty interest in having a spouse's visa application granted or processed more quickly, as admission of aliens to the United States is a privilege granted by the sovereign, not a right. The Supreme Court precedent, such as *Kerry v. Din*, explicitly forecloses such a substantive due process argument.
2.  Since there is no protected liberty or property interest at stake in an immigrant visa and a process governed by a rule of reason exists for applicants, there can be no procedural due process violation.
The plaintiff's equal protection claim, also a Fifth Amendment claim, was dismissed as a matter of law for similar reasons.

The Court dismissed the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claim for unreasonable delay because:
1.  The State Department's practice of processing visa applications on a first-in, first-out basis is considered a ""rule of reason"" for decision-making, and Congress has not established a specific statutory timetable for visa processing.
2.  A delay of approximately fourteen months (less than two years) is not deemed unreasonable as a matter of law, especially given the extraordinary backlog of cases (increasing from approximately 75,000 to 473,000) and the disruption to services caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.
3.  Granting relief would place the plaintiff ahead of other similarly situated applicants, interfering with the State Department's allocation of resources and its prioritization of ""mission critical"" functions during the pandemic.
4.  The plaintiff's broad allegations regarding the delay's toll on his physical and mental health and the harm to his family were insufficient to meet the criteria for human health and welfare or other interests prejudiced by the delay.
5.  No impropriety or bad faith on the part of the agency was alleged.
Consequently, the mandamus action based on the APA claim also failed.

The Court dismissed the Fifth Amendment due process claims (both substantive and procedural) because:
1.  There is no fundamental liberty interest in having a spouse's visa application granted or processed more quickly, as admission of aliens to the United States is a privilege granted by the sovereign, not a right. The Supreme Court precedent, such as *Kerry v. Din*, explicitly forecloses such a substantive due process argument.
2.  Since there is no protected liberty or property interest at stake in an immigrant visa and a process governed by a rule of reason exists for applicants, there can be no procedural due process violation.
The plaintiff's equal protection claim, also a Fifth Amendment claim, was dismissed as a matter of law for similar reasons.

Claims against the DHS defendants were dismissed as moot because the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) had already approved the I-130 petition and transferred it to the National Visa Center, completing its role in the process. Additionally, claims concerning the Controlled Application Review and Resolution Program (CARRP) were dismissed as moot against DHS and constitutionally unripe against the State Department, as CARRP is a DHS policy.","Based on the provided context:

Regarding an unreasonable delay claim:
It is unlikely a U.S. lawful permanent resident could successfully sue for unreasonable delay. Context 2 states that a 42-month delay in processing was found not unreasonable. A delay of under two years, even with a global pandemic, would likely also not be considered unreasonable.

Regarding Fifth Amendment due process rights:
The context does not provide enough information to answer this part of the question. Context 1 discusses a Fifth Amendment claim related to a visa denial, not a processing delay. It found no violation in that specific case. It does not indicate if a processing delay, especially one under two years and pandemic-related, would violate Fifth Amendment due process rights.","['Fifth Amendment: The Fifth Amendment was cited in a case where plaintiffs argued the denial of their EB-5 visa petitions was unconstitutional; the court found no violation of their rights under the amendment and granted summary judgment to the defendants.', 'Zaman v.

"An EB-5 investor, John, filed a Form I-526 petition based on an investment in a limited partnership that included a ""Call Option"" allowing the general partner to repurchase John's interest for a fixed amount if the business was successful.

Additionally, the court would likely find that USCIS acted arbitrarily and capriciously by issuing different denial notices with varying reasons to functionally equivalent petitions without providing any explanation for the disparate treatment.

The court would not likely order John's petition granted at this stage.","This scenario presents two distinct legal challenges under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA): the substantive ""at risk"" determination and the procedural issue of disparate treatment.

Here's the likely outcome:

1.  **Regarding the ""At Risk"" Determination (Call Option):**
    *   **USCIS's Position Likely Upheld:** USCIS's determination that the Call Option means John's capital is not ""at risk"" and constitutes a ""guaranteed return"" is likely to be upheld by a court.
    *   **Reasoning:** The EB-5 program explicitly requires that the investor's capital be ""at risk,"" meaning it must be subject to actual loss and there can be no guarantee of return or repayment. A ""Call Option"" allowing the general partner to repurchase the investor's interest for a *fixed amount* if the business is *successful* directly contradicts this principle.
        *   **Fixed Amount:** This caps the potential upside and, more importantly, provides a predetermined exit value in a successful scenario, insulating the investor from the full market risk of the enterprise's performance.
        *   **Contingent on Success:** While it's not a guarantee if the business fails, it *is* a guarantee of a fixed return *if* the business succeeds. The ""at risk"" requirement means the investor must bear the risk of the enterprise's actual performance, not just its failure. A fixed repurchase price upon success removes the direct correlation between the degree of success and the investor's return, effectively guaranteeing a specific return in the best-case scenario.
    *   **Deference to Agency Interpretation:** Courts generally grant deference to an agency's reasonable interpretation of its own regulations and the statutes it administers (e.g., *Chevron* deference). USCIS has consistently interpreted the ""at risk"" requirement strictly to prevent arrangements that shield investors from the full commercial risk.

2.  **Regarding the Disparate Treatment of Petitions:**
    *   **USCIS's Action Likely Overturned/Remanded:** John has a strong argument that USCIS's disparate treatment of functionally identical petitions, without explanation, is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law under the APA (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)).
    *   **Reasoning:** A fundamental principle of administrative law is that an agency must treat similarly situated individuals similarly. If an agency deviates from its established policies or treats identical cases differently, it must provide a reasoned explanation for the distinction.
        *   **Lack of Consistency:** The fact that ""functionally identical petitions"" received ""different denial notices,"" citing ""various other reasons or fewer reasons for denial,"" with ""no explanation for the varied treatment,"" strongly suggests arbitrary decision-making. It indicates that USCIS may not have applied a consistent standard or rationale across all petitions from the same project.
        *   **Due Process/Fairness:** This lack of consistency undermines the fairness and predictability of the administrative process. Investors are entitled to understand the basis for an agency's decision and expect that similar cases will be adjudicated under similar standards.
    *   **Likely Remedy:** A court would likely *remand* John's petition (and potentially instruct USCIS to review the others) back to USCIS for reconsideration. The court would not approve John's petition but would order USCIS to:
        *   Provide a consistent and reasoned explanation for its adjudication of all functionally identical petitions from that partnership.
        *   Either apply the same reasons for denial to all similar petitions or explain why different reasons apply.

**Overall Likely Outcome:**

John is likely to succeed on the procedural challenge regarding disparate treatment. The court would probably find USCIS's inconsistent adjudication arbitrary and capricious and remand the case. However, this does not mean John's petition would be approved. Upon remand, USCIS would be required to re-adjudicate the petitions consistently. If the ""at risk"" determination regarding the Call Option is indeed a valid and consistently applied reason for denial (which it likely is, as discussed above), USCIS could then re-deny John's petition (and potentially the others) based on that consistent reasoning, providing a clear explanation for all similar denials.

Therefore, while John might win a procedural battle, he would likely still face a denial on the substantive ""at risk"" issue if USCIS consistently applies that reasoning.",[],,0.8301408290863037,16.21728971962617,21.143546209761155

Here's why:

1.  **Exclusive Federal Jurisdiction over Immigration:** Immigration law is an area of exclusive federal jurisdiction. State courts lack the authority to review the merits, validity, or procedures of federal immigration enforcement actions, including immigration detainers and warrants issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

2.  **Federal Habeas Corpus is the Proper Avenue:** Challenges to the legality of federal detention, including detention based on immigration detainers, must be brought in **federal court** through a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241. Federal courts are the proper forum to adjudicate claims regarding the lawfulness of federal immigration custody.

3.  **287(g) Agreement Reinforces Federal Authority:** The existence of a 287(g) agreement means that the Sheriff's deputies, when acting on the immigration detainer and warrant, are essentially performing functions as deputized federal immigration officers. Their actions in this capacity are subject to federal, not state, judicial review.

4.  **Scope of State Habeas Corpus:** While state courts have the power to issue writs of habeas corpus, their authority is generally limited to reviewing the legality of detention under *state law*. Once the state charges are dismissed, the state law basis for the individual's detention ceases. The continued detention is then based solely on federal authority, which falls outside the purview of state court review for its substantive validity.

**In summary:** The state superior court would likely dismiss the petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, advising the resident to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court to challenge the federal immigration detainer and warrant.",[],,0.8564959764480591,17.32693365695793,16.700691747572847
"A lawful permanent resident, who is a non-English speaker with significant ties to his country of origin, pleads guilty to an aggravated felony that mandates deportation. His attorney did not explicitly advise him of the mandatory deportation consequences, and he did not request an interpreter during the plea hearing.

Here's a breakdown of the legal reasoning:

1.  **Ineffective Assistance of Counsel (IAC) - *Padilla v. Kentucky***:
    *   **Deficient Performance:** Under *Padilla v. Kentucky*, counsel has an affirmative duty to advise non-citizen clients about the immigration consequences of a guilty plea. For offenses that *mandate* deportation (like an aggravated felony), counsel must provide clear, unequivocal advice that deportation is a certainty. The attorney's failure to ""explicitly advise him of the mandatory deportation consequences"" likely constitutes deficient performance.
    *   **Prejudice:** To succeed on an IAC claim, the defendant must also show prejudice – a ""reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial."" This is where the defendant's claim significantly weakens:
        *   **Court's Advisement:** The trial court *did* advise him of the ""possibility of deportation"" as required by statute, and he ""responded affirmatively when asked if he understood."" While ""possibility"" is not ""mandatory,"" it put him on notice of the severe immigration consequences.
        *   **Contradictory Statements:** His current claim that avoiding deportation was his primary concern and that he didn't fully understand directly contradicts his sworn statements to the judge at the time of the plea. Courts are highly reluctant to allow defendants to contradict their solemn declarations made in open court without compelling evidence of manifest injustice.
        *   **Aggravated Felony:** Given that the plea was to an aggravated felony, deportation is mandatory. Even if he had gone to trial and been convicted, the deportation consequence would remain. The prejudice argument would need to show he would have pursued a trial *and* had a reasonable chance of avoiding conviction, or that he would have sought a different plea bargain that did not trigger mandatory deportation. His current claim focuses on understanding, not on a viable defense.
        *   **Delay:** The four-year delay in seeking to withdraw the plea significantly undermines his claim that avoiding deportation was his primary concern *at the time of the plea*. If it truly was his primary concern, he would likely have acted much sooner, especially as deportation proceedings would likely have commenced or been imminent.

2.  **Right to an Interpreter:**
    *   **Waiver/Failure to Assert:** While due process requires an interpreter for defendants who cannot understand the proceedings, the defendant ""did not request an interpreter during the plea hearing."" Furthermore, when the judge asked if he understood the potential for deportation, he ""responded affirmatively."" This indicates either that he *did* understand sufficiently, or that he failed to make his language barrier known to the court, effectively waiving his right to an interpreter at that time. His current claim that he ""did not fully understand"" is contradicted by his contemporaneous actions and statements.

3.  **Voluntariness of the Plea:**
    *   A guilty plea must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. The court's colloquy (the questioning of the defendant) is designed to ensure this. The fact that the court advised him of the possibility of deportation and he affirmed understanding strongly supports the voluntariness of the plea at the time it was entered. His current claims, made four years later, are self-serving and directly contradict the record.

4.  **Timeliness of the Motion:**
    *   Motions to withdraw a guilty plea after sentencing are generally granted only to correct a ""manifest injustice."" The four-year delay in this case is substantial and weighs heavily against granting the motion. It suggests a lack of diligence and undermines the credibility of his current claims.

**Conclusion:**

While the attorney's failure to explicitly advise of *mandatory* deportation likely constitutes deficient performance under *Padilla*, the defendant fails to establish the necessary prejudice. His affirmative responses to the judge, his failure to request an interpreter, and the significant four-year delay in seeking to withdraw the plea all contradict his current claims and undermine his credibility. The trial court's record strongly supports that the plea was knowing and voluntary at the time it was entered. Therefore, the trial court should deny his motion to withdraw the guilty plea.",[],,0.8298760056495667,13.467878787878789,34.12681818181821
"A U.S. citizen sponsors his alien spouse for immigration by signing a USCIS Form I-864 Affidavit of Support. At the time, they have a minor child who is a U.S. citizen and was born before the affidavit was signed, and this child is not listed on the affidavit. The couple later separates, and the sponsored spouse seeks monetary damages from the sponsor for breach of the Affidavit of Support. When calculating the sponsor's obligation, what household size should the court use for the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) Guidelines, and if the spouse also loaned the sponsor money in a foreign currency, in what currency should the repayment be awarded?","The court erred by using the FPL Guidelines for a two-person household. The sponsor only promised to support the alien spouse in the Affidavit of Support, and the U.S. citizen child was not listed on the form as an immigrant intended to be sponsored, as the Affidavit of Support does not apply to U.S. citizens. Therefore, the court should calculate the damages using the FPL Guidelines for a one-person household. For example, for 2016, if the one-person FPL Guideline was $14,850 and the spouse's adjusted gross income was $8,511, the damages would be $6,339. The court did not err by deducting depreciation expenses from the spouse's adjusted gross income when calculating damages.

Regarding the loan, as the spouse loaned and paid the sponsor in Australian Dollars (AUD), the interest was repaid in AUD, and the spouse's loss occurred in AUD, the court erred by awarding equitable relief payable in U.S. Dollars (USD). On remand, the trial court must correct and convert the spouse's equitable award and any interest thereon to be repayable in AUD for any outstanding balance.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  **Improper Venue in D.C.:** The initial filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is likely an improper venue. While federal agencies have a presence in D.C., the specific venue rules (28 U.S.C. § 1391) generally require venue where:
    *   A defendant resides (USCIS is headquartered in Maryland).
    *   A substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred (the plaintiff resides in Virginia, and the impact of the delayed adjudication is felt there).

2.  **Proper Venues:**
    *   **Eastern District of Virginia:** This is a proper venue because the plaintiff resides there, and a substantial part of the events (the asylum application, the delay, and the plaintiff's residence) giving rise to the claim occurred or are centered there.
    *   **District of Maryland:** This is also a proper venue because the defendant, USCIS, is headquartered there.

3.  **The Court's Discretion and ""Interest of Justice"":** When a case is filed in an improper venue, 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a) allows the court to dismiss the case or, ""if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.""

4.  **Considering the Parties' Requests:**
    *   **USCIS (Defendant) requested transfer to the Eastern District of Virginia.** This is a strong indicator, as the defendant is proposing a venue that is proper and convenient for the plaintiff (their home district).
    *   **The plaintiff countered with the District of Maryland** if D.C. was improper, citing USCIS's location and his counsel's bar admissions. While Maryland is a proper venue, the plaintiff's residence in Virginia is often given more weight in determining the most appropriate forum for a mandamus action against a federal agency, especially when the defendant *also* proposes that district.

Given that the defendant specifically requested the Eastern District of Virginia, which is the plaintiff's home district and a proper venue where the ""events"" are substantially connected, it is the most logical and just choice for transfer. The convenience of counsel, while a factor, is generally secondary to the statutory venue requirements and the convenience of the parties and witnesses.",[],,0.8484511971473694,10.936810055865923,48.53298044692738

Here's why:

1.  **State Jurisdiction over Family Law:** Divorce and family law are areas traditionally reserved for state jurisdiction. Federal courts are generally very reluctant to preempt state family law unless there is a direct, unavoidable conflict with federal law.

2.  **Domicile vs. Immigration Status:**
    *   **Domicile for Divorce:** To establish domicile for divorce purposes, a person generally needs to demonstrate physical presence in the state and an *intent to remain indefinitely*. This intent is a subjective state of mind.
    *   **Immigration Status:** A person's immigration status (like a TD visa) dictates their legal right to be in the U.S. and the conditions of their stay. While a TD visa requires maintaining a foreign residence and not intending permanent residence *for the purpose of that visa*, this does not necessarily preclude an individual from forming the *subjective intent* to make a U.S. state their home for state law purposes, especially if they are actively pursuing a change in their immigration status.

3.  **The Significance of the I-130 Petition:** Maria's U.S. citizen sister filed a Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) on her behalf. This action is strong evidence that Maria *does* intend to establish permanent residence in the United States. While her TD visa *currently* requires her not to have such intent, the filing of the I-130 demonstrates a clear intent to *change* her status and reside permanently. Many courts have held that an individual's subjective intent to establish domicile for state law purposes can exist even if their current immigration status does not permit permanent residence, particularly when they are actively seeking lawful permanent resident status.

4.  **No Direct Conflict/Preemption:** Allowing Maria to establish domicile for divorce purposes in Arizona does not directly conflict with or undermine federal immigration law. Granting a divorce does not confer immigration benefits or alter her immigration status. It simply allows a state court to exercise its jurisdiction over a marriage within its borders. Federal immigration law does not explicitly or implicitly preempt a state's ability to define domicile for divorce purposes for individuals in Maria's situation.

**Conclusion:**

The trial court erred by conflating Maria's current non-immigrant visa requirements with her ability to form the subjective intent necessary to establish domicile for state law purposes. Her active pursuit of lawful permanent resident status through the I-130 petition strongly indicates an intent to remain indefinitely, which is the key factor for domicile in divorce proceedings. Federal immigration law does not preempt a state's authority to adjudicate divorces based on an individual's subjective intent to establish domicile, even if their current visa status has limitations.",[],,0.84227109,14.44020939734423,27.560497957099102
"A Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status applicant, whose I-360 petition was revoked by USCIS because it was received on his 21st birthday instead of before, challenges the revocation.

This involves navigating the complex landscape of judicial review in immigration law, particularly the jurisdictional stripping provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and the exceptions to those bars.

**General Principles of Judicial Review in Immigration:**

*   **INA § 242(a)(2)(B) and (C):** These sections generally bar judicial review of certain discretionary decisions and judgments regarding the granting of relief under specific INA sections.
*   **INA § 242(a)(2)(D) (The ""Zipper Clause""):** This crucial provision states that ""nothing in subparagraph (B) or (C), or in any other provision of this Act (other than this section) which limits or precludes judicial review or the timing of judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section."" This clause is often interpreted to preserve review for constitutional claims and questions of law, even when other provisions attempt to strip jurisdiction.
*   **District Court vs. Court of Appeals:** Generally, challenges to final orders of removal or certain discretionary decisions made *during* removal proceedings are reviewed by the Courts of Appeals. However, challenges to agency actions *outside* the context of a final order of removal, such as the denial or revocation of a visa petition (like an I-360), often fall under the District Court's general federal question jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1331) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), unless specifically precluded.
*   **Mandamus Jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1361):** Can be used to compel an agency to perform a ministerial duty, but not to review discretionary decisions.
*   **Habeas Corpus (28 U.S.C. § 2241):** Primarily for challenges to detention, but can sometimes be used for certain legal challenges to immigration decisions, especially when other avenues are foreclosed.

Let's analyze each claim:

---

**1. APA Challenge to Filing Regulations (Unreasonable for not permitting same-day electronic or hand delivery for I-360 petitions):**

*   **Nature of the Claim:** This is a challenge to the *validity of an agency regulation* itself, alleging it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law under the APA (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). It's a ""question of law"" regarding the agency's rulemaking authority and the reasonableness of the rule.
*   **Jurisdiction:**
    *   **District Court:** U.S. District Courts generally have subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question) to review agency regulations under the APA.
    *   **INA § 242(a)(2)(D) Applicability:** While § 242(a)(2)(D) primarily refers to petitions for review in the Courts of Appeals, courts have generally held that challenges to the *legality of regulations or policies* that are not tied to a specific final order of removal or a discretionary decision *during* removal proceedings are properly brought in District Court. The revocation of an I-360 petition is an administrative decision, not a final order of removal.
    *   **No Specific Preclusion:** There isn't a specific INA provision that explicitly bars District Court review of the *validity of a filing regulation* for an I-360 petition. The bars in § 242(a)(2)(B) and (C) typically apply to the *application* of discretion or the *granting* of relief, not to the foundational rules governing how one applies.
*   **Conclusion for Claim 1:** A U.S. District Court **likely has subject matter jurisdiction** to review this claim as a question of law under the APA, pursuant to its general federal question jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1331).

---

**2. APA Challenge to the 16-month Delay (Unreasonable delay between approval and revocation):**

*   **Nature of the Claim:** This is an APA claim alleging agency action was ""unreasonably delayed"" (5 U.S.C. § 706(1)) or that the revocation itself, after a prior approval, was arbitrary and capricious (5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)). The core issue is the agency's conduct in processing and re-evaluating the petition.
*   **Jurisdiction:**
    *   **District Court:** Challenges to agency delay or arbitrary agency action regarding petition processing are typically heard in District Courts under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and the APA.
    *   **Revocation of Approved Petitions:** While the *decision to approve or deny* an I-360 petition might involve some discretion, the *revocation* of an approved petition, especially if based on a procedural ground like a filing deadline, can raise questions of law or statutory interpretation. Courts generally retain jurisdiction to review whether an agency's revocation decision was based on a correct interpretation of law or was arbitrary and capricious.
    *   **INA § 242(a)(2)(B) and (C) Applicability:** These bars are less likely to apply directly to a challenge concerning *unreasonable delay* or the *procedural fairness* of a revocation, as these are often considered questions of law or constitutional claims rather than purely discretionary decisions on the merits of the underlying benefit.
*   **Conclusion for Claim 2:** A U.S. District Court **likely has subject matter jurisdiction** to review this claim. Challenges to unreasonable agency delay are generally reviewable under the APA, and the revocation of an approved petition, particularly on procedural grounds, often presents questions of law or arbitrary/capricious agency action that are within the District Court's purview.

---

**3. Constitutional Rights Challenge (Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses regarding inability to file electronically):**

*   **Nature of the Claim:** This is a direct constitutional challenge, alleging violations of Equal Protection (discriminatory treatment compared to other applicants who can file electronically) and Due Process (lack of fair process due to the restrictive filing method and its impact on the age-out issue).
*   **Jurisdiction:**
    *   **INA § 242(a)(2)(D):** This is the most critical provision here. It explicitly preserves judicial review for ""constitutional claims or questions of law."" The Supreme Court in *INS v. St. Cyr* affirmed the importance of habeas corpus and general federal question jurisdiction for constitutional claims, even in the face of broad jurisdictional stripping clauses. While *St. Cyr* primarily dealt with habeas, the principle that Congress must speak with ""unmistakable clarity"" to bar constitutional review is strong.
    *   **District Court:** Constitutional challenges to agency actions or regulations are generally within the District Court's federal question jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1331). Even if the underlying immigration decision itself is unreviewable, the court can still review the *constitutionality* of the process or the statute/regulation applied.
    *   **Equal Protection/Due Process:** These are fundamental constitutional rights. Courts are highly reluctant to find that they lack jurisdiction to hear such claims, especially when they challenge the fairness of the procedures or the differential treatment by the government.
*   **Conclusion for Claim 3:** A U.S. District Court **almost certainly has subject matter jurisdiction** to review these constitutional claims. INA § 242(a)(2)(D) explicitly preserves review for constitutional claims, and such claims are traditionally heard in District Courts under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.

---

**Overall Summary of Subject Matter Jurisdiction:**

A U.S. District Court would likely have subject matter jurisdiction to review all three of the applicant's claims:

1.  **APA Challenge to Filing Regulations:** Yes, as a question of law regarding the validity and reasonableness of an agency regulation under the APA, falling under general federal question jurisdiction.
2.  **APA Challenge to 16-month Delay:** Yes, as a claim of unreasonable agency delay and potentially arbitrary/capricious action under the APA, also falling under general federal question jurisdiction.
3.  **Constitutional Rights Challenge:** Yes, explicitly preserved by INA § 242(a)(2)(D) for constitutional claims, and reviewable under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.

It's important to note that having subject matter jurisdiction does not mean the applicant will *win* on the merits. It merely means the court has the authority to hear and decide the case. The court would still need to determine if the regulations are indeed unreasonable, if the delay was unlawful, or if constitutional rights were violated.",[],,0.8322534561157227,14.779784655864837,27.331355421686766

The court will hold the constitutional claims in abeyance, allowing the applicant to decide whether to transfer them to the D.C. Circuit now or later.","Based on typical federal court interpretations of immigration jurisdictional bars, particularly 8 U.S.C. § 1252, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), here's how each claim would likely fare:

1.  **APA Claim: Unreasonable Filing Requirements (Challenge to the ""before 21st birthday"" regulation)**
    *   **May Proceed.** This claim challenges the *legality* or *reasonableness* of an agency regulation itself, which is generally considered a ""question of law"" reviewable under the APA. Federal courts typically retain jurisdiction to review whether an agency's regulation is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, or exceeds statutory authority. This is not a challenge to a discretionary decision in a particular case, but to the rule itself.

2.  **APA Claim: Unreasonable Delay in Revocation**
    *   **May Proceed.** Claims of unreasonable agency delay or failure to act are generally reviewable under APA § 706(1). This is a procedural challenge to the agency's conduct, not a challenge to the merits of a discretionary decision, and thus typically falls outside the scope of most immigration jurisdictional bars.

3.  **Equal Protection Claim**
    *   **May Proceed (jurisdictionally).** 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D) explicitly states that ""nothing in subparagraph (B) or (C) ... shall be construed to preclude review of constitutional claims or questions of law."" An Equal Protection claim is a constitutional claim.
    *   **Caveat:** While the claim may proceed jurisdictionally, the applicant faces a very high bar on the merits due to the ""plenary power doctrine"" in immigration law. Courts grant extreme deference to Congress and the Executive Branch on immigration classifications, applying a rational basis review that rarely strikes down such classifications unless they impinge on fundamental rights or involve suspect classifications (which age-based classifications typically are not in this context).

4.  **Due Process Claim**
    *   **May Proceed (jurisdictionally).** Similar to Equal Protection, a Due Process claim is a constitutional claim and is therefore generally reviewable under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D).
    *   **Caveat:** The success of the claim would depend on whether the applicant can demonstrate a protected liberty or property interest and that the agency's actions (e.g., the filing requirement, the delay, or the revocation process) deprived them of that interest without adequate notice or opportunity to be heard. Claims challenging the *process* by which a decision was made are more likely to be successful than claims attempting to re-litigate the merits of the underlying decision under the guise of due process.

**Summary:**

*   **May Proceed:**
    *   APA Claim: Unreasonable Filing Requirements
    *   APA Claim: Unreasonable Delay in Revocation
    *   Equal Protection Claim (jurisdictionally, but difficult on merits)
    *   Due Process Claim (jurisdictionally, but success depends on specific allegations)

*   **Subject to Jurisdictional Bars:** None of the listed claims are typically subject to jurisdictional bars under 8 U.S.C. § 1252, as they fall under the exceptions for ""constitutional claims"" or ""questions of law"" or challenge agency procedure/regulations rather than discretionary merits decisions.",[],,0.8171278834342957,14.86141513170925,25.674095365418907

1.  **Lack of Jurisdiction to Review the Factual/Discretionary Finding of Hardship:**
    The Court of Appeals will likely **dismiss** the portion of the petition for review that challenges the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) determination that the spouse's chronic health conditions (high cholesterol and asthma) do not amount to ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.""

    *   **Reasoning:** Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), federal courts generally lack jurisdiction to review any judgment regarding the granting of relief under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b (cancellation of removal) to the extent the judgment is discretionary. The determination of whether a particular set of facts constitutes ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" is a highly fact-specific and discretionary judgment entrusted to the BIA. The Court of Appeals cannot reweigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the BIA regarding the degree of hardship. Even if the court might have found the hardship to meet the standard, it cannot overturn the BIA's discretionary finding unless it was based on an incorrect legal standard or was arbitrary and capricious (which is a very high bar for discretionary decisions).

2.  **Jurisdiction to Review the Application of the Legal Standard:**
    The Court of Appeals **will retain jurisdiction** to review the petitioner's argument that the BIA applied an **incorrect legal standard** in evaluating her prima facie eligibility for relief.

    *   **Reasoning:** Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D), federal courts retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law. Whether the BIA applied the correct legal standard for ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" or for *prima facie* eligibility for cancellation of removal is a pure question of law.
    *   **If the Court Finds a Legal Error:** If the Court of Appeals determines that the BIA indeed applied an incorrect legal standard (e.g., misinterpreted the statutory definition of ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship,"" failed to consider legally mandated factors, or imposed extra-statutory requirements for *prima facie* eligibility), the court would **vacate** the BIA's decision and **remand** the case back to the BIA. The remand would instruct the BIA to reconsider the motion to reopen and the *prima facie* eligibility for cancellation of removal under the *correct* legal standard. The Court of Appeals would *not* grant cancellation of removal itself, as that remains a discretionary decision for the BIA/Immigration Judge.

**In summary:** The Court of Appeals would likely dismiss the challenge to the BIA's *factual finding* on the degree of hardship, but it would review the claim that the BIA used an *incorrect legal standard*. If a legal error is found, the case would be sent back to the BIA for reconsideration.",[],,0.8328075408935547,15.048565351894819,29.819555942253174

Here's why:

1.  **Actions Under Color of Authority:** The officers were uniformed police officers, forcibly entered his home, and accused him of a crime. These are actions typically reserved for state agents and are performed under the ""color of law"" or ""color of authority,"" even if the actions themselves were illegal under domestic law. They were able to commit these acts *because* they were police officers.

2.  **Explicit State-Related Purpose:** The officers explicitly stated they were acting because Mr. X had reported a corrupt local official. This directly links their actions to Mr. X's interaction with the state and a state-related purpose: punishing him for reporting corruption and intimidating him (and potentially others) from doing so again. This falls squarely within the types of purposes prohibited by CAT (punishment, intimidation, coercion).

3.  **""Acquiescence"" of the State:** The CAT definition of torture includes acts inflicted ""by or at the instigation of or with the consent or **acquiescence** of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.""
    *   The fact that these officers are ""known for taking bribes and acting on personal vendettas"" suggests a pattern of behavior that the government is likely aware of.
    *   The government's common claim that such officers are ""rogue agents"" does not automatically absolve it of responsibility under CAT. If the government consistently fails to investigate, prosecute, or punish such officers, or if there's a widespread pattern of such abuse, it can be seen as ""acquiescence."" The state's inaction in the face of known abuses by its agents can be interpreted as tacit approval or a deliberate disregard, thereby satisfying the official capacity requirement.

In summary, while the officers may have had personal motives (bribes, vendettas), they used their official position and powers to carry out the abuse, and the stated reason for their actions directly implicated a state function (punishing a whistleblower). The government's potential acquiescence to such behavior further strengthens Mr. X's claim.",[],,0.846794069,13.692202068147143,33.251929140532326

"Can an asylum applicant challenge the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision not to refer their case to a three-member panel, or argue that the BIA was biased for not requiring the government to file a brief, or claim a due process violation because a single BIA member rendered a decision that effectively precludes reversal of an immigration judge's order without an intervening change in law?","No. The court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA's discretionary decision not to refer a case to a three-member panel because there are no meaningful standards to judge the agency's exercise of discretion.

"A rancher whose property is near the U.S. southern border experienced significant damage, including lost cattle profits, depleted water, and trash, directly linked to a dramatic increase in illegal immigration following the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) decisions to halt border wall construction and terminate the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) without conducting environmental analyses.

2.  **Responsive Migrants:** Migrants reacted predictably to these relaxed policies, leading to a sharp uptick in illegal immigration, which overwhelmed Border Patrol resources nationwide and diverted manpower away from areas like the Tucson Sector, where Smith lives, thus increasing unpatrolled areas.
3.  **Related Harms:** This dramatic increase in illegal immigration directly led to the increased migrant traffic on Smith’s land, causing the damage to his property, water, and cattle.

"An individual applies for an EB-5 visa, having invested capital in a new commercial enterprise.

Therefore, the denial, which lacks a rational connection between the facts and the choice made, would likely be set aside.","USCIS's denial in this scenario is **unlikely to be upheld** as consistent with federal law and prior agency decisions.

Here's why:

1.  **The ""At Risk"" Requirement:**
    *   **Federal Law/Policy:** The EB-5 program requires that the investor's capital be ""at risk."" This means the capital must be subject to potential loss and cannot be guaranteed repayment. USCIS policy, as articulated in various memos and precedent decisions (e.g., *Matter of Hsiung*), emphasizes that the investor must be in an equity position, not a creditor position, and cannot have a guaranteed return or a right to compel repayment of their capital.
    *   **Analysis of Call Option:** A ""call option"" grants the *company* the choice to buy out the investor's interest. Crucially, it ""does not give the investor any right to demand repayment."" This distinction is vital.
        *   **Investor's Perspective:** From the investor's standpoint, their capital remains ""at risk"" because they cannot force the company to buy them out or repay them. The success of their investment, and whether the call option is ever exercised, depends entirely on the performance of the new commercial enterprise (NCE) and the company's discretion. If the NCE fails, the investor loses their capital, regardless of the call option.
        *   **Distinction from Prohibited Arrangements:** This differs significantly from prohibited arrangements such as:
            *   **Put Options:** Where the *investor* has the right to force the company to buy back their interest. This would remove the ""at risk"" nature.
            *   **Guaranteed Redemption Agreements:** Where the company is contractually obligated to repay the investor's capital after a certain period or upon certain conditions.
            *   **Debt Arrangements:** Where the investor makes a loan to the NCE with a fixed repayment schedule and interest.

2.  **Prohibited Debt Arrangement:**
    *   **Federal Law/Policy:** EB-5 requires an equity investment, not a loan. A debt arrangement implies a promise of repayment to the investor, making them a creditor.
    *   **Analysis of Call Option:** A call option, as described, does not transform an equity investment into a debt arrangement. The investor remains an equity holder, sharing in the risks and potential rewards of the enterprise. The company's *option* to buy back an equity interest is a common feature in many equity investments and exit strategies; it is not an obligation to repay a loan. The investor is not a creditor, and there is no fixed repayment schedule or interest.

**Conclusion:**

USCIS's assertion that a company-held call option (without an investor's right to demand repayment) means the investor's capital is not ""at risk"" or constitutes a prohibited debt arrangement is generally inconsistent with established EB-5 policy and the interpretation of the ""at risk"" requirement. The key factor is who holds the right to compel the transaction. As long as the investor cannot demand repayment, their capital remains subject to the fortunes of the NCE, satisfying the ""at risk"" requirement for an equity investment. Therefore, the denial is likely to be overturned if challenged.",[],,0.8213885426521301,12.306919831223627,39.299123661149025
"A U-visa applicant, whose application has been pending for over four years, files a lawsuit against USCIS alleging unreasonable delay in determining their eligibility for the U-visa waitlist and failure to issue interim employment authorization documents (EAD). The applicant cites a 2011 regulation mandating EAD adjudication within 90 days or the issuance of interim documents. The government moves to dismiss all claims, arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction under IIRIRA provisions (8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(g), 1252(a)(5), and 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)) and failure to state a claim, further contending that the 2011 EAD regulation was repealed in 2017 and therefore does not apply. How should the court rule on these claims?","The court should rule as follows:
1.  **Jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(g) and 1252(a)(5):** The court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint. These IIRIRA provisions do not apply because the plaintiff is not challenging the commencement, adjudication, or execution of a removal order, nor seeking review of a removal order. Instead, the claims challenge the government's delay in adjudicating U-visa waitlist eligibility and work authorization.
2.  **Unreasonable Delay in U-Visa Waitlist Eligibility (APA & Mandamus):**
    *   **Jurisdiction:** The court has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). Determining eligibility for the U-visa waitlist is a mandatory assessment, not a discretionary decision specified by statute, as 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(2) requires eligible petitioners to be placed on the waitlist.
    *   **Merits (Failure to State a Claim):** The plaintiff fails to state a claim for unreasonable delay. While the four-year delay is substantial and several ""TRAC test"" factors favor the plaintiff (e.g., sense of Congress for 180-day processing, human welfare interests, prejudice by delay), the D.C. Circuit precedent places significant weight on the ""competing priorities"" factor. A judicial order expediting this single application would merely shift the plaintiff ahead of thousands of other equally worthy applicants, creating more unfairness than it would remedy, and would interfere with the agency's resource allocation, which is a matter for the political branches.
3.  **Failure to Adjudicate EAD under 8 U.S.C. § 1184(p)(6) (APA & Mandamus):** The court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this claim. The statute explicitly states that ""The Secretary may grant work authorization,"" indicating a purely discretionary decision. Therefore, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) strips the court of jurisdiction to review the Secretary's handling of such discretionary EAD requests, and there is no clear duty to act required for APA or mandamus relief.
4.  **Failure to Issue Interim Work Authorization under 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) (2011) (APA & Mandamus):**
    *   **Applicable Regulation:** The 2011 version of 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) applies. It was in effect when the plaintiff filed their application in June 2016 and when the 90-day adjudication period expired in September 2016. Applying the later-effective 2017 repeal retroactively would strip the plaintiff of a vested right to interim work authorization, which is impermissible without express congressional authorization.
    *   **Jurisdiction:** The court has jurisdiction. The 2011 regulation's language (""USCIS will adjudicate... within 90 days... Failure to complete the adjudication within 90 days will result in the grant..."") creates a clear, mandatory duty for the agency to either adjudicate or issue interim EAD, making it a discrete agency action required to be taken under the APA. Judicial review is not precluded by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as that section applies only to statutory, not regulatory, discretion.
    *   **Merits (Stated a Claim):** The plaintiff has stated a claim for agency action unlawfully withheld. The plain language of the 2011 regulation requires adjudication or issuance of interim EAD within 90 days of receipt, which the agency failed to do. The agency's interpretation that the 90-day clock begins only after a threshold determination on an underlying benefit has no support in the regulation's text and is contradicted by the agency's own reasons for repealing the rule.
5.  **Challenge to Repeal of 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) (2011) without Notice-and-Comment:** This claim is dismissed. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendants' arguments in opposition, thereby conceding the issue.

The agency's interpretation that the 90-day clock begins only after a threshold determination on an underlying benefit has no support in the regulation's text and is contradicted by the agency's own reasons for repealing the rule.
5.  **Challenge to Repeal of 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) (2011) without Notice-and-Comment:** This claim is dismissed. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendants' arguments in opposition, thereby conceding the issue. Furthermore, the complaint lacked factual allegations supporting the claim, and the Federal Register documentation shows that the agency followed proper notice-and-comment procedures for the repeal.","The provided context is not enough to fully answer how the court should rule.

Context 1 is not relevant to this question.

Context 2 discusses judicial review under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D). This section allows courts to review constitutional claims or questions of law. This applies specifically in removal cases. The current lawsuit involves a U-visa delay, not a removal case. The context does not explain how this applies to the government's specific jurisdictional arguments. These arguments cite 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(g), 1252(a)(5), and 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). Therefore, the context is insufficient to rule on the government's jurisdictional claims.

Context 3 confirms the 2011 regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d). This rule required USCIS to decide EAD applications within 90 days. Alternatively, it required them to grant interim work authorization. The government argues this regulation was repealed in 2017. However, the provided context does not state whether this regulation was repealed. Thus, the court cannot rule on whether the 2011 regulation applies.

District Court will likely take the following procedural actions regarding the claims of the plaintiffs:

1.  **Dismissal of Claims for Adjudicated Plaintiffs (Mootness):**
    *   **Action:** The D.C. District Court will almost certainly dismiss the claims of the plaintiffs whose applications have been adjudicated during the pendency of the lawsuit.
    *   **Reasoning:** Once an application is adjudicated, the specific relief sought (an order compelling adjudication of *that specific application*) becomes moot. A case is moot when the issues presented are no longer ""live"" or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome. Since the primary relief sought for unreasonable delay is typically an order to adjudicate, that relief has been granted for these plaintiffs. While they might argue for a ""capable of repetition, yet evading review"" exception, it's generally difficult to apply to individual administrative delays unless there's a strong showing of a recurring, unreviewable injury to *those specific plaintiffs*. Claims for damages due to delay are generally not available under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which is the likely basis for this type of suit.

2.  **Consideration of Venue for Remaining Plaintiffs (Motion to Transfer):**
    *   **Action:** For the plaintiffs whose applications remain pending at the USCIS service center in the Northern District of Texas, the D.C. District Court will likely face a motion from USCIS to transfer the case (or at least these specific claims) to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.
    *   **Reasoning:**
        *   **Venue Statute (28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)):** For actions against federal agencies, venue is proper in any district where (1) a defendant resides, (2) a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or (3) the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved. While USCIS headquarters are in D.C. (making D.C. a proper venue for challenges to nationwide policies), the ""omission"" (failure to adjudicate) for these specific applications is occurring at the Texas service center.
        *   **Convenience (28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)):** Even if D.C. is a technically proper venue, a court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought ""for the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice."" USCIS would argue that the relevant documents, witnesses (e.g., adjudicating officers, supervisors, processing data), and the locus of the alleged delay are all in Texas.
        *   **Nature of the Claim:** While the lawsuit alleges delays ""due to a new biometrics policy"" (which might originate in D.C.), the *specific relief* sought for these plaintiffs is the adjudication of their individual applications, which are physically located and processed in Texas. Courts often prefer to have such claims heard in the district where the specific administrative action (or inaction) is occurring.
    *   **Likely Outcome:** The D.C. District Court may decide to transfer these specific claims to the Northern District of Texas. It might retain jurisdiction over any broader challenge to the *legality* of the biometrics policy itself if it's framed as a nationwide policy challenge, but for individual adjudication delays, transfer is a strong possibility.

In summary: The D.C. District Court will likely dismiss the claims of the plaintiffs whose applications have been adjudicated due to mootness. For the remaining plaintiffs whose applications are pending in Texas, the court will likely consider a motion to transfer venue to the Northern District of Texas, and may grant it, especially if the core of the dispute revolves around the processing at that specific service center.",[],,0.8304309844970703,12.551348403127083,40.02228471
"An immigration advocacy group, similar to the American Immigration Council, seeks records from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding a program where CBP agents conducted credible fear interviews. The group specifically requested records related to training materials, supervision protocols, and grant/denial rates, but CBP only searched for a limited set of categories. USCIS and DHS withheld several documents, including drafts, issue papers, briefing memos, and an email containing names of CBP officers, citing deliberative process and personal privacy exemptions.

3.  **Exemptions 6 and 7(C) (Personal Privacy) Withholdings by USCIS for CBP Officer Names:** The court would find these withholdings improper.

### Circumstances for U.S. Court of Appeals Jurisdiction

Generally, U.S. Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a). However, this jurisdiction is subject to significant limitations, particularly concerning discretionary decisions and factual findings.

1.  **General Jurisdictional Bars for Discretionary Relief:**
    *   **Cancellation of Removal (8 U.S.C. § 1229b) and Voluntary Departure (8 U.S.C. § 1229c):** Both of these forms of relief are highly discretionary. Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) and (ii), courts generally lack jurisdiction to review ""any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section... 1229b [cancellation of removal]"" or ""any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security.""
    *   This means that if the BIA denied cancellation or voluntary departure purely as an exercise of discretion (e.g., finding the alien met the statutory eligibility requirements but still chose not to grant relief), a Court of Appeals would typically lack jurisdiction to review that discretionary denial.

2.  **The ""Questions of Law"" and ""Constitutional Claims"" Exception:**
    *   Crucially, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D) carves out an exception to these jurisdictional bars: ""Nothing in subparagraph (B) or (C), or in any other provision of this chapter (other than this section) which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of **constitutional claims or questions of law** raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.""
    *   This exception is the primary avenue for the alien's claims to be heard.

    Let's apply this to the alien's specific claims:

    *   **Challenging the BIA's Finding of Lack of Good Moral Character (GMC):**
        *   **Jurisdiction exists for questions of law:** The BIA's determination of whether an alien possesses good moral character is a *predicate finding* for eligibility for cancellation of removal and voluntary departure. While the ultimate decision to grant relief is discretionary, the *determination of eligibility* can involve questions of law.
        *   If the alien argues that the BIA *misinterpreted* the statutory definition of good moral character (8 U.S.C. § 1101(f)) or applied an incorrect legal standard in making its GMC finding, this would be a ""question of law"" reviewable under § 1252(a)(2)(D).
        *   **No jurisdiction for purely factual disputes (generally):** If the alien is merely challenging the BIA's *factual findings* underlying the GMC determination (e.g., disputing whether they committed a specific act that the BIA found to preclude GMC), courts generally lack jurisdiction to reweigh evidence or review factual findings unless they are ""unsupported by substantial evidence."" However, even this ""substantial evidence"" review can sometimes be framed as a question of law (e.g., whether *any* evidence supports the finding). The line can be blurry.

    *   **Asserting the BIA's Decision was Ultra Vires (Expired Temporary BIA Members):**
        *   **Jurisdiction clearly exists:** This claim directly challenges the *legality* and *authority* of the decision-making body itself. It asserts that the BIA panel that issued the decision was improperly constituted and therefore lacked the legal power to act. This is a quintessential ""question of law"" and potentially a ""constitutional claim"" (e.g., due process right to a decision by a properly constituted tribunal).
        *   Courts of Appeals routinely exercise jurisdiction over such claims, as they go to the fundamental validity of the agency action, not the merits of the underlying immigration case.

---

### How Such Claims Are Typically Resolved

1.  **Claim Challenging Lack of Good Moral Character (GMC):**
    *   **Standard of Review:**
        *   **Questions of Law:** If the alien raises a question of law (e.g., misinterpretation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101(f)), the Court of Appeals will review the BIA's legal interpretation *de novo* (without deference to the BIA's interpretation, though some deference under *Chevron* might apply to the agency's reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutes).
        *   **Factual Findings:** If the court finds jurisdiction to review factual findings (e.g., whether the BIA's finding of a specific act precluding GMC is supported by evidence), it will review for ""substantial evidence."" This means the BIA's factual findings will be upheld unless ""any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary."" This is a highly deferential standard, making it difficult for the alien to prevail on purely factual grounds.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   If the Court of Appeals finds that the BIA committed a legal error in determining GMC (e.g., applied the wrong legal standard or misinterpreted the statute), it will typically **vacate** the BIA's decision and **remand** the case to the BIA for reconsideration under the correct legal standard.
        *   If the Court of Appeals upholds the BIA's GMC finding (either on legal or factual grounds), and GMC was a prerequisite for relief, then the denial of cancellation of removal and voluntary departure will stand, and the petition for review will be denied.

2.  **Claim Asserting the BIA's Decision was Ultra Vires (Expired Temporary BIA Members):**
    *   **Standard of Review:** This is a pure question of law, reviewed *de novo*. The court will examine the relevant statutes, regulations, and agency delegations of authority to determine if the BIA panel was properly constituted and had the authority to issue the decision.
    *   **Resolution:**
        *   If the Court of Appeals finds that the BIA panel was indeed improperly constituted (e.g., the temporary members' terms had expired, or they were not validly appointed/delegated authority), the BIA's decision is considered **void or voidable**.
        *   The court will **vacate** the BIA's decision and **remand** the case to the BIA for a new decision by a properly constituted panel. This does not mean the alien wins the underlying immigration case; it means they are entitled to a decision from a legally authorized tribunal. This type of procedural error is often considered fundamental and requires a new decision.

---

In summary, the alien's best chance for judicial review lies in framing their challenges as ""questions of law"" or ""constitutional claims"" under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D). The ultra vires claim is particularly strong in this regard, as it directly challenges the procedural legitimacy of the BIA's decision-making process.",[],,0.8282828330993652,14.053742574257427,30.28269306930696

An action against the federal government can be brought in any judicial district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Here, the plaintiff's Form I-140 petition was processed and denied at USCIS’s Texas Service Center, located in the Northern District of Texas, meaning a substantial part of the events occurred there.

The case should be transferred to the Northern District of Texas based on both public and private interests.
*   **Public Interests:** The controversy is local to the Northern District of Texas, where the petition was processed and denied. Courts routinely find that cases challenging immigration petition denials should be decided where the petition was processed. The familiarity of courts with federal law is neutral, and while the Northern District of Texas is marginally more congested than the D.C. court, it does not have such enormous backlogs to prevent transfer, especially given the strong local interest.
*   **Private Interests:** The government prefers the Northern District of Texas. The claim arose in that district. Convenience to the parties, witnesses, and evidence also favors the Northern District of Texas, as any relevant witnesses or documents are most likely located there. The plaintiff's choice to litigate in D.C. receives only minimal deference because the plaintiff does not reside in D.C. and the factual allegations lack a significant nexus to D.C. officials or their specific actions.

Therefore, considering all factors, the case should be transferred to the Northern District of Texas.

*   **Public Interests:** The controversy is local to the Northern District of Texas, where the petition was processed and denied. Courts routinely find that cases challenging immigration petition denials should be decided where the petition was processed. The familiarity of courts with federal law is neutral, and while the Northern District of Texas is marginally more congested than the D.C. court, it does not have such enormous backlogs to prevent transfer, especially given the strong local interest.
*   **Private Interests:** The government prefers the Northern District of Texas. The claim arose in that district. Convenience to the parties, witnesses, and evidence also favors the Northern District of Texas, as any relevant witnesses or documents are most likely located there. The plaintiff's choice to litigate in D.C. receives only minimal deference because the plaintiff does not reside in D.C. and the factual allegations lack a significant nexus to D.C. officials or their specific actions.

Therefore, considering all factors, the case should be transferred to the Northern District of Texas. The transferring court found it appropriate to transfer the case without fully resolving its own subject matter jurisdiction, leaving that question for the transferee court to determine.","This question involves the federal venue statute, specifically for actions against the United States or its agencies, and the rules for transferring venue.

**I. Proper Venue for the Action**

The governing statute for venue in civil actions against the United States, a federal agency, or a federal officer or employee acting in an official capacity is **28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)**. This section provides that venue is proper in a judicial district in which:

1.  **a defendant in the action resides,**
2.  **a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated, or**
3.  **the plaintiff resides if no real property is involved in the action.**

Let's apply these provisions to the facts:

*   **District of Columbia (D.C.):**
    *   **Under § 1391(e)(1):** USCIS is a federal agency. Its headquarters and principal office are located in Washington, D.C. Therefore, D.C. is a proper venue because a defendant (USCIS) resides there.
*   **Northern District of Texas:**
    *   **Under § 1391(e)(2):** The immigrant visa petition was processed and denied at a USCIS service center located in the Northern District of Texas. The denial of the petition constitutes a ""substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim."" Therefore, the Northern District of Texas is a proper venue.
*   **District of Maryland:**
    *   **Under § 1391(e)(3):** The plaintiff resides in Maryland, and the action does not involve real property. Therefore, the District of Maryland is a proper venue.

**Conclusion on Proper Venue:** Venue would be proper in the **District of Columbia**, the **Northern District of Texas**, and the **District of Maryland**.

**II. Should the Case Be Transferred?**

The decision to transfer a case is governed by **28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)**, which states: ""For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.""

The court considers several factors, including:

1.  **Plaintiff's choice of forum:** This is generally given substantial weight, but it is not dispositive. The plaintiff chose D.C.
2.  **Convenience of the parties:**
    *   **Plaintiff:** Resides in Maryland, which is geographically close to D.C. Transferring to N.D. Texas would be inconvenient. Transferring to D. Maryland would be most convenient for the plaintiff.
    *   **Government/USCIS:** The agency's headquarters are in D.C. The specific officers who processed and denied the petition are in N.D. Texas.
3.  **Convenience of the witnesses:** In administrative review cases like this, live testimony from agency officials is often not required, as the court typically reviews the administrative record. However, if any testimony were needed, the relevant USCIS officials would be in N.D. Texas. Plaintiff's witnesses (e.g., family, employer, immigration attorney) would likely be in Maryland or D.C.
4.  **Location of relevant evidence:** The administrative record was compiled in N.D. Texas. However, administrative records are typically electronic and easily transferable.
5.  **Local interest in the controversy:** Maryland has an interest because the plaintiff resides there. N.D. Texas has an interest because the agency action occurred there. D.C. has a general interest in overseeing federal agency actions.
6.  **""Interest of justice"" factors:** This includes court congestion, familiarity with the applicable law, and the desirability of resolving local controversies locally. D.C. courts are highly experienced in reviewing federal agency actions under the Administrative Procedure Act.

**Analysis of Transfer Options:**

*   **Transfer to Northern District of Texas:**
    *   **Arguments for:** This is where the agency's decision was made and where the specific officials involved are located.
    *   **Arguments against:** It is far from the plaintiff's residence and the plaintiff's chosen forum. Given that the review is likely based on the administrative record, the physical location of the decision-makers may not be a strong factor for convenience of witnesses.
*   **Transfer to District of Maryland:**
    *   **Arguments for:** This is where the plaintiff resides, making it most convenient for the plaintiff.
    *   **Arguments against:** The agency action did not occur there.
*   **Keeping the case in the District of Columbia:**
    *   **Arguments for:** It is the plaintiff's chosen forum, it is a proper venue, and D.C. courts have extensive experience with federal agency litigation. It is also convenient for USCIS headquarters.
    *   **Arguments against:** It is not where the specific denial occurred, nor where the plaintiff resides.

**Recommendation:**

Given that D.C. is a proper venue and the plaintiff's chosen forum, the court would likely give deference to that choice unless the government can demonstrate a strong reason for transfer based on convenience and the interest of justice.

While the Northern District of Texas is where the denial occurred, transferring the case there would significantly inconvenience the plaintiff. The primary ""witnesses"" in an administrative review case are often the administrative record itself, which is easily accessible electronically regardless of location.

The District of Maryland is the most convenient forum for the plaintiff. If the court decides that the plaintiff's convenience outweighs the deference to the plaintiff's choice of forum in D.C. and the location of the agency action in Texas, then a transfer to Maryland would be the most logical choice.

However, many courts in D.C. are reluctant to transfer cases challenging federal agency action out of the district, especially when D.C. is a proper venue under § 1391(e)(1) due to the agency's residence.

**Therefore, while all three districts are proper venues, the most likely outcome is that the case either remains in the District of Columbia (due to plaintiff's choice and D.C.'s role as a hub for federal agency litigation) or, if the court prioritizes plaintiff's convenience, it could be transferred to the District of Maryland.** A transfer to the Northern District of Texas is less likely given the inconvenience to the plaintiff and the nature of administrative review.",[],,0.8462820053100586,10.952964870798855,43.97014989022128

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1.  **Government's Stance (Exemption 5 - Deliberative Process Privilege):**
    *   **Predecisional:** The government will argue that the ""final decision"" was the official grant in 2013. Therefore, any documents created between 2010 and 2012 were generated *before* that final decision.
    *   **Deliberative:** They will assert that these documents reflect internal discussions, recommendations, analyses, drafts, and policy considerations that were part of the ongoing process of evaluating the asylum application. The purpose of Exemption 5 is to protect this ""give-and-take"" of the decision-making process, allowing government officials to express candid opinions without fear of public scrutiny before a final decision is reached.
    *   Asylum applications often involve multiple levels of review, legal analysis, and policy considerations that can span years. The government will argue that even if a preliminary recommendation was made in 2010, the process was not ""final"" until the official grant in 2013.

    *   The asylum seeker's argument hinges on proving that the *substantive* decision was made in 2010, and the subsequent years were merely administrative formalities or the implementation of an already-made decision.
    *   To succeed, the asylum seeker would need to demonstrate that the documents from 2010-2012 are *post-decisional* because they either:
        *   Reflect the agency's ""working law"" or final policy adopted in 2010.
        *   Are purely factual accounts of a decision already made.
        *   Are part of the implementation of a decision that was definitively concluded in 2010, even if not formally announced.

3.  **Likely Judicial Approach:**
    *   **Deference to Agency:** Courts generally give agencies some deference in determining when a decision becomes ""final,"" especially in complex administrative processes like asylum applications. The burden is on the agency to demonstrate that Exemption 5 applies, but the burden is on the requester to show that the agency's claim is incorrect.
    *   **Difficulty of Proving an Earlier ""Final"" Decision:** It is often difficult for a requester to definitively prove that an agency's internal process reached a final, irreversible decision at an earlier date than the agency claims, especially without access to the very documents in question. The agency can usually articulate a plausible argument that the process was ongoing until the formal grant.
    *   **Segregability:** Even if the government successfully withholds deliberative portions, they are still obligated to release any reasonably segregable non-exempt (e.g., purely factual) information from those documents.

**Conclusion:**

While the asylum seeker's argument has a legal basis (the distinction between pre- and post-decisional documents), it is challenging to overcome the government's assertion that the decision was not final until the official grant date. Unless the asylum seeker can point to specific, undeniable evidence (e.g., a clear internal memo stating ""final decision made"" in 2010, with only ministerial steps remaining) that the decision was truly concluded in 2010, courts tend to side with the agency's determination of when its deliberative process ended and the final decision was made. Therefore, the government is likely to succeed in withholding the deliberative portions of the 2010-2012 documents.",[],,0.8184744119644165,16.77010953941694,17.49495041
"Imagine a noncitizen, Ms. A, was convicted under a state law that criminalizes accessory-after-the-fact with a ""general intent"" requirement.

The court would grant the petition for review, vacate the removal order, and remand the case, directing the government to facilitate the noncitizen's return for further proceedings.","This scenario involves complex interplay between state criminal law, federal immigration law, and federal court review. Here's a breakdown of the likely outcome:

**1. Aggravated Felony Classification (Categorical Match Argument):**

*   **The Law:** To determine if a state conviction qualifies as a federal ""aggravated felony,"" federal courts apply the **categorical approach**. This approach compares the elements of the state statute of conviction to the elements of the generic federal offense. If the state statute criminalizes conduct broader than the federal definition, it's not a categorical match. If the state statute is ""divisible"" (lists alternative elements), the **modified categorical approach** might be used to look at a limited set of record documents to determine which part of the statute the noncitizen was convicted under.
*   **Obstruction of Justice (Generic Definition):** Federal courts generally interpret ""obstruction of justice"" as an aggravated felony to require **specific intent** – meaning the intent to obstruct, impede, or corruptly influence the administration of justice.
*   **Ms. A's Conviction:** Ms. A was convicted under a state law for accessory-after-the-fact with a **""general intent""** requirement. General intent typically means intending to commit the act itself, or being aware of the consequences, but not necessarily having a specific purpose beyond that. For accessory-after-the-fact, it often means knowing a felony was committed and intending to help the principal avoid apprehension, without necessarily requiring the specific intent to obstruct a *judicial proceeding*.
*   **Likely Outcome on Categorical Match:** A federal court is highly likely to find that a state conviction for accessory-after-the-fact with *only* a general intent requirement is **not a categorical match** for an aggravated felony of obstruction of justice, which typically demands specific intent to obstruct justice. The federal definition is narrower regarding the required mental state. The state law's general intent requirement would criminalize a broader range of conduct than the federal generic definition of obstruction of justice.

**2. Validity of the Removal Order (Due Process and Jurisdictional Review):**

*   **Jurisdiction for Review:** While federal courts have limited jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, especially for aliens removable due to certain criminal offenses (like aggravated felonies under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(C)), there are crucial exceptions:
    *   **Questions of Law:** Courts *can* review ""questions of law,"" which includes whether a conviction *actually* constitutes an aggravated felony. This is precisely what Ms. A's categorical match argument presents.
    *   **Constitutional Claims:** Courts *can* review constitutional claims, such as due process violations.
*   **Due Process in Expedited Removal:** Expedited removal proceedings offer significantly fewer procedural protections than standard removal proceedings. However, due process still requires that the government follow its own laws and regulations and that the determination of removability be based on a correct application of the law.
*   **Likely Outcome on Removal Order:**
    *   **Overturning the AF Classification:** If the federal court agrees that Ms. A's conviction is not a categorical match for an aggravated felony, it will **overturn the immigration authorities' classification** of her conviction as an aggravated felony. This is a question of law reviewable by the court.
    *   **Vacating the Removal Order:** Because the expedited removal proceedings were initiated and conducted *on the incorrect premise* that Ms. A was an aggravated felon, the federal court would likely **vacate the removal order**. The procedural errors Ms. A alleges would be viewed in light of this fundamental legal error. The expedited removal process, with its limited due process, is only permissible for certain categories of aliens, and if Ms. A does not fall into the aggravated felony category, then the process itself was improperly applied.
    *   **Remand:** The case would likely be **remanded** to the immigration authorities for further proceedings. This would mean Ms. A would likely be placed into standard removal proceedings, where she would have greater due process rights, including the opportunity to apply for various forms of relief from removal that are generally unavailable to aggravated felons.

**In summary:**

The federal court would likely rule in favor of Ms. A. It would find that her state conviction for accessory-after-the-fact with a general intent requirement is **not a categorical match** for an aggravated felony of obstruction of justice, which typically requires specific intent. Consequently, the court would **vacate the expedited removal order** because it was based on an erroneous legal classification, and the procedural limitations of expedited removal were therefore improperly applied to her. The case would be **remanded** for standard removal proceedings.",[],,0.8313825726509094,15.161310033736406,20.686054357302623

Here's a breakdown:

**1. Withholding of Removal Claim: BIA Likely Erred**

The BIA's decision regarding withholding of removal contains two significant procedural and substantive errors:

*   **Reliance on Facts Not Found by the Immigration Judge (IJ) Without Remand:**
    *   **Principle:** When an applicant establishes past persecution, there is a presumption of future persecution. To rebut this presumption, the government must present evidence that conditions have changed to such an extent that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution, or that the applicant could reasonably relocate within their country.
    *   **Error:** The BIA is primarily an appellate body. While it can review the IJ's findings of fact for clear error, it generally cannot engage in *de novo* fact-finding, especially when it involves new or disputed facts, without remanding the case to the IJ. By relying on facts not found by the IJ to rebut the presumption of future persecution, the BIA bypassed the IJ's role as the primary fact-finder. This denies the applicant the opportunity to present evidence or arguments regarding those specific facts before the IJ, and it prevents the BIA from reviewing the IJ's initial findings for clear error. This is a procedural due process concern and often grounds for remand by a reviewing court.

*   **Failure to Explicitly Address the ""Pattern-or-Practice"" Claim:**
    *   **Principle:** Even if the presumption of future persecution is rebutted, an applicant can still establish eligibility for withholding of removal by demonstrating that there is a ""pattern or practice"" of persecution against a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant, and that the applicant is a member of that group. This is an alternative ground for relief.
    *   **Error:** The BIA is required to provide a reasoned decision that addresses all material issues raised by the applicant. By failing to explicitly address the applicant's alternative ""pattern-or-practice"" claim, the BIA failed to fulfill its duty to provide a comprehensive and reasoned decision. This constitutes a failure to consider a potentially dispositive claim and is a common ground for judicial remand.

**2. Convention Against Torture (CAT) Claim: BIA's Method Not Inherently Erroneous**

*   **Principle:** The BIA can affirm an Immigration Judge's decision and incorporate the IJ's reasoning, provided that the IJ's reasoning is sound, adequately addresses the legal and factual issues, and is supported by the record. This is a common and permissible practice for appellate bodies.
*   **Analysis:** The prompt states the BIA ""affirmed by incorporating the IJ's reasoning."" This *method* of review is generally acceptable. The error, if any, would lie in the *substance* of the IJ's reasoning itself (e.g., if the IJ misapplied the law, failed to consider relevant evidence, or made findings unsupported by the record). However, based *solely on the description provided*, the BIA's act of incorporating the IJ's reasoning for the CAT claim is not, in itself, an error. We would need more information about the *content* of the IJ's reasoning to determine if the BIA's affirmation was substantively flawed.

**Conclusion:**

The BIA clearly erred in its handling of the **withholding of removal claim** by engaging in improper fact-finding without remand and by failing to address a material alternative claim. Its method for handling the **CAT claim** (incorporating the IJ's reasoning) is procedurally acceptable, though the ultimate correctness of that decision would depend on the soundness of the IJ's underlying reasoning.",[],,0.8414044380187988,14.872772298456265,31.698340837621515

Therefore, the petition for review regarding the denial of the motion to remand is denied.","Here's an analysis of the two questions:

### 1. Does the Court of Appeals have jurisdiction to review the BIA's affirmance of the continuance denial?

**No, generally the Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction to review the BIA's affirmance of the denial of a motion to continue removal proceedings.**

*   **Statutory Bar:** Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (INA § 242(a)(2)(B)(ii)), courts are generally barred from reviewing ""any other decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security.""
*   **Discretionary Nature:** The decision to grant or deny a motion to continue removal proceedings is highly discretionary. Immigration judges and the BIA have broad authority to manage their dockets and proceedings. The IJ's reasons for denial—untimeliness and lack of diligence—are classic discretionary factors that fall squarely within this bar.
*   **Limited Exceptions:** While courts can review constitutional claims or questions of law, the denial of a continuance based on factual findings of untimeliness and lack of diligence is typically considered a discretionary decision, not a pure question of law or a constitutional issue. Therefore, the Court of Appeals would likely find itself without jurisdiction to review this aspect of the BIA's decision.

### 2. Did the BIA abuse its discretion in denying the motion to remand?

**Yes, it is highly likely that the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion to remand after the I-130 petition was approved.**

*   **Standard of Review:** The BIA's denial of a motion to remand is reviewed for abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion occurs when the BIA's decision is arbitrary, capricious, without rational explanation, or contrary to law.
*   **Materiality of New Evidence:** A motion to remand typically requires the presentation of new, material evidence that was not available and could not have been presented at the prior hearing. The approval of an I-130 petition is **highly material** new evidence. It fundamentally changes the individual's eligibility for adjustment of status, which is a form of relief from removal.
*   **Change in Circumstances:** The IJ's original denial of the *continuance* was based on untimeliness and lack of diligence in *pursuing* the I-130. However, once the I-130 is *approved*, the landscape shifts dramatically. The diligence issue regarding the *filing and adjudication* of the I-130 becomes less relevant than the *fact* of its approval. An approved I-130 establishes a prima facie eligibility for adjustment of status (assuming other eligibility requirements like admissibility are met).
*   **Purpose of Remand:** The purpose of the remand was to allow the individual to pursue adjustment of status, a form of relief directly enabled by the approved I-130. Denying this opportunity when the primary prerequisite for that relief has been met, without a compelling counter-reason (e.g., clear statutory ineligibility for adjustment, or a finding that the individual is otherwise inadmissible and cannot overcome that inadmissibility), would generally be considered an arbitrary decision.
*   **Conclusion:** By denying the motion to remand after the I-130 was approved, the BIA likely failed to adequately consider the significant change in circumstances and the material new evidence that directly impacts the individual's eligibility for relief. This would constitute an abuse of discretion. The BIA should have remanded the case to the IJ to allow the individual to apply for adjustment of status based on the approved I-130.",[],,0.8372171521186829,14.678535806902055,26.568457344238368
"An alien was apprehended after illegal entry and provided an address to immigration officials. The address was deficient, leading to returned mail and the alien's in absentia removal. Eighteen years later, the alien moves to reopen removal proceedings, asserting that a different, correct address was initially provided and that the immigration officer made an error, thus entitling the alien to notice.

Here's how a court should rule:

**I. Motion to Reopen Based on Officer Error and Lack of Notice**

1.  **General Rule for Motions to Reopen:** Motions to reopen are generally disfavored and subject to strict time limits. For an *in absentia* removal order, an alien typically has **180 days** from the date of the order to file a motion to reopen, demonstrating that the failure to appear was due to ""exceptional circumstances."" Alternatively, an alien can file a motion to reopen at any time if they can demonstrate they **did not receive notice** of the hearing.

2.  **The 18-Year Delay:** The alien's 18-year delay in filing the motion is a significant hurdle. While there is no time limit for motions to reopen based on lack of notice, the alien bears the burden of proving they did not receive notice.

3.  **Burden of Proof for Lack of Notice/Officer Error:**
    *   The government typically establishes a presumption of regular mail delivery if it can show proper mailing to the address provided by the alien.
    *   The alien must overcome this presumption by presenting ""affirmative evidence"" that the notice was not received.
    *   **Officer Error Claim:** The alien asserts that a *different, correct* address was initially provided and the officer made an error. This is a difficult claim to prove 18 years later. The alien would need compelling evidence beyond a mere assertion (e.g., contemporaneous notes, witness testimony, or other records) to show that the officer *incorrectly recorded* the address. Without such evidence, the court would likely find the alien failed to meet their burden.
    *   **Due Diligence:** A court would also consider the alien's lack of due diligence over 18 years. Why did the alien wait so long to inquire about their case or challenge the removal order, especially after mail was returned? This long period of silence significantly weakens the alien's claim of lack of notice or officer error, as it suggests a failure to monitor their immigration proceedings.

4.  **Equitable Tolling:** While equitable tolling can sometimes excuse a late filing, it requires the alien to show: (1) extraordinary circumstances beyond their control prevented timely filing, and (2) they exercised due diligence in pursuing their rights. An 18-year delay, without a compelling explanation for the delay itself (e.g., being in a coma, imprisoned without access to legal counsel), would make it extremely difficult to establish due diligence.

**Conclusion on Officer Error/Lack of Notice:** The court would likely **deny** the motion to reopen on this ground. The 18-year delay, the difficulty in proving officer error without contemporaneous evidence, and the alien's apparent lack of due diligence would be insurmountable obstacles.

**II. Motion to Reopen Based on Defective NTA and Eligibility for Cancellation of Removal**

1.  **The *Pereira v. Sessions* and *Niz-Chavez v. Garland* Precedent:**
    *   **Background:** The Supreme Court in *Pereira v. Sessions* (2018) held that an NTA that does not specify the ""time and place"" of an initial removal hearing does not trigger the ""stop-time rule"" for purposes of calculating continuous physical presence for cancellation of removal. *Niz-Chavez v. Garland* (2021) further clarified that the NTA must be a single document containing all the required information, including the date and time, to trigger the stop-time rule.
    *   **Impact on Stop-Time Rule:** If the original NTA indeed failed to specify the date and time of the hearing, then it did *not* trigger the stop-time rule. This means the alien continued to accrue continuous physical presence in the U.S. until the issuance of a compliant NTA or the actual service of a notice of hearing with the date and time. If the alien now meets the 10-year continuous physical presence requirement (and other requirements like good moral character and exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative), they *could* be eligible for cancellation of removal.

2.  **Jurisdictional vs. Stop-Time Rule:** It's important to distinguish. While *Pereira* focused on the stop-time rule, some aliens have argued that an NTA lacking date/time is jurisdictionally defective, rendering any subsequent *in absentia* order void. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and circuit courts have generally held that while a defective NTA may not trigger the stop-time rule, it does not necessarily deprive the immigration court of jurisdiction if the alien subsequently receives a notice of hearing with the date and time and fails to appear, or if the alien appears at a master calendar hearing. However, in this case, the alien *did not appear* and claims they never received proper notice due to the address issue.

3.  **Applying to the Alien's Case:**
    *   **Eligibility for Cancellation:** If the original NTA was defective as described, and the alien never received a subsequent notice with the date and time (due to the address issue), then the stop-time rule was likely *not* triggered. This would make the alien *potentially eligible* for cancellation of removal if they now meet the continuous physical presence requirement and other statutory criteria.
    *   **Reopening the *In Absentia* Order:** The core issue remains whether the alien can reopen the 18-year-old *in absentia* removal order. While the *Pereira* and *Niz-Chavez* decisions clarify the stop-time rule, they do not automatically provide a mechanism to reopen old *in absentia* orders, especially when the alien failed to exercise due diligence.
    *   **Void Order Argument:** The strongest argument for the alien here is that if the NTA was so fundamentally defective that it failed to vest jurisdiction in the immigration court for the *in absentia* order, then the order itself might be considered void. A void order can generally be challenged at any time. However, courts are reluctant to find orders ""void"" unless there was a complete lack of jurisdiction. If the court finds that the NTA, despite its defect, was sufficient to initiate proceedings (and the subsequent notice of hearing, even if not received, was properly sent), then the order might be merely ""erroneous"" rather than ""void.""

**Overall Ruling and Rationale:**

A court would likely **deny the alien's motion to reopen.**

1.  **Lack of Due Diligence:** The primary reason for denial would be the alien's extreme delay (18 years) and lack of due diligence. Even if the NTA was defective and the officer made an error, the alien had a responsibility to monitor their immigration case. Waiting 18 years without any inquiry or action is a significant barrier to reopening.
2.  **Difficulty Proving Officer Error:** Proving an officer error regarding an address 18 years after the fact, without contemporaneous evidence, would be nearly impossible.
3.  **The *Pereira*/*Niz-Chavez* Argument (While Legally Sound, Fails Procedurally):** While the alien's argument regarding the defective NTA and the stop-time rule is legally sound *in principle* for determining eligibility for cancellation of removal, it does not automatically overcome the procedural hurdles of reopening an 18-year-old *in absentia* order. The alien must first successfully reopen the removal proceedings. The Supreme Court cases clarified the stop-time rule, but they did not create a new, unlimited basis for reopening old *in absentia* orders where the alien failed to exercise due diligence.
4.  **Prejudice to the Government:** The government would also argue prejudice due to the extreme delay, including the loss of records, unavailability of witnesses, and the difficulty of reconstructing events from nearly two decades ago.

In summary, while the alien raises a valid point about the impact of *Pereira* and *Niz-Chavez* on the stop-time rule, the procedural bar of the 18-year delay and the alien's lack of due diligence in pursuing their case would almost certainly lead the court to **deny the motion to reopen.** The court would likely find that the alien failed to meet the high burden required to reopen such an old case, regardless of the potential merits of the underlying cancellation of removal claim.",[],,0.8254112005233765,14.132200279574608,35.18435677283196
