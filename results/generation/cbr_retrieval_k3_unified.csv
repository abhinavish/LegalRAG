"An individual in removal proceedings had their application for asylum and other relief denied due to failure to submit biometrics, despite being previously instructed by the Immigration Judge while pro se. They subsequently retained counsel, who also failed to advise them about the biometrics requirement. After the denial, and more than 90 days after the final order of removal, they filed a motion to reopen, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel prevented a merits hearing and that this justified equitable tolling of the filing deadline. They also requested *sua sponte* reopening by the Board of Immigration Appeals.

The court found that even if counsel's failure to remind about biometrics was ineffective, there was no argument that counsel's ineffectiveness caused the motion to reopen itself to be untimely filed. The failure to move in a timely fashion to reopen was an independent basis for denying relief, and the individual failed to show any basis for equitable tolling of the filing deadline for reopening. Additionally, the court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA's discretionary decision not to invoke its *sua sponte* authority to reopen a case.","[]","['mata v lynch', 'heckler v chaney', 'garcia v garland', 'eneugwu v garland', 'diaz v sessions', 'mejia v whitaker', 'kucana v holder', 'rashidi v american president lines', 'united states v english', 'ramos-portillo v barr', 'dada v mukasey', 'lugo-resendez v lynch']","[]","[{'title': 'brooks v board of immigration appeals', 'chunk': 'is presumptive evidence of  intent to use the same unlawfully against another.”).

The court would likely defer to the agency's factual assessment, finding that USCIS's conclusion that the organization failed to meet its evidentiary burden was fair and reasonable, considering the evidence in proportion to its other activities.

"A group of international students had their F-1 visas terminated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after discovering they were ""enrolled"" in a sham university created by DHS as part of a sting operation. The termination letter stated their SEVIS record and Form I-20 had been set to ""Terminated due to your fraudulent enrollment."" The students filed a federal lawsuit challenging the termination, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and Due Process, and seeking an order prohibiting the Government from finding they committed fraud. The District Court dismissed the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding the DHS action was not final because reinstatement proceedings were pending and the case was not ripe for review. The students appealed. If these students were to proceed with their appeal, would the appellate court likely find that the DHS's termination of their F-1 visas constitutes a final agency action ripe for judicial review under the APA?","Yes, the appellate court would likely find that DHS's termination of the F-1 visas constitutes a final agency action ripe for judicial review under the APA. The termination order marked the consummation of the agency's decision-making process by stripping the students of their lawful status and placing a fraud notation on their records, thus determining a ""right or obligation.""

The court would disagree with the District Court's conclusions regarding finality and ripeness for two main reasons:
1.  **Finality of Agency Action:**
    *   **Reinstatement Proceedings Are Not a Prerequisite for Review:** There is no statutory or regulatory requirement for students to seek reinstatement after F-1 visa termination. Moreover, reinstatement proceedings do not provide a mechanism to review the propriety of the original termination order or the ""fraudulent enrollment"" decision. Even if reinstatement is granted, it does not ""wipe away"" the prior agency decision.
    *   **Removal Proceedings Are Not a Prerequisite for Review:** The finality of an order cannot be conditioned on potential, uninitiated removal proceedings, which may never occur. Furthermore, neither immigration judges nor the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) have the authority to review the USCIS's discretionary denial of a motion to reinstate student status or to overturn the initial termination decision. Therefore, removal proceedings do not offer an opportunity to contest the agency action. The termination is the culmination, not the initiation, of the agency's decision-making process.
2.  **Ripeness for Review:**
    *   The case is ripe because the parties are in a sufficiently adversarial posture, and the students are genuinely aggrieved by the termination of their lawful status and the permanent ""fraud"" notation on their records. The government's shifting position on whether the students were victims or participants in the fraud further underscores the need for judicial review that would otherwise be absent. Ongoing reinstatement proceedings do not render the case unripe because they do not provide an avenue to review ICE's termination decision.","[]","['hosseini v johnson', 'tooloee v ins', 'babbitt v united farm workers natl union', 'qureshi v holder', 'young dong kim v holder', 'ftc v standard oil co. of cal.', 'jie fang v dir us immigration & customs enforcement', 'ghorbani v ins', 'palakovic v wetzel', 'bennett v spear', 'pinho v gonzales', 'felmeister v office of attorney ethics', 'cabaccang v uscis', 'peachlum v city of york', 'darby v cisneros', 'kashani v nelson', 'marathon petroleum corp. v secy of finance']","[]","[{'title': 'aguilar-mendez', 'chunk': 'The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s request for voluntary departure.

"My petition for cancellation of removal was denied because the immigration judge found that the hardship my deportation would cause my American-citizen child was not ""exceptional and extremely unusual.""

The court would review whether the correct legal standard was applied de novo and factual findings for substantial evidence. Simply arguing that the IJ did not consider or give sufficient weight to certain facts, such as dangerous conditions in your home country or the emotional and psychological peril to your son, would likely be seen as a challenge to the factual findings.

"A non-citizen defendant, whose native language is not English, entered a guilty plea to a first-degree misdemeanor assault charge without an interpreter present at the plea hearing. The defendant never requested an interpreter, and the trial court did not appoint one, though an earlier arraignment entry was stamped ""Order Interpreter – Swahili"" for unknown reasons. During the plea, the trial court read the defendant a form advising of potential immigration consequences (deportation, exclusion, denial of naturalization), and the defendant indicated understanding. Subsequently, the defendant filed a post-sentence motion to withdraw the guilty plea, arguing that a limited understanding of English prevented a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary plea, and that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to adequately advise on the immigration consequences of an assault conviction. The defendant claimed that if properly advised, they would have gone to trial. Should the trial court grant the motion to withdraw the guilty plea?","No, the trial court should deny the motion to withdraw the guilty plea. The defendant's claim of a language barrier preventing a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary plea lacks merit, as the regularity of the plea hearing (where no interpreter was requested or appointed) is presumed due to the absence of a transcript. Additionally, testimony from the defendant's former counsel and probation officer, along with previous trial testimony given by the defendant without an interpreter, demonstrated a sufficient ability to understand and communicate in English at the time of the plea. Regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, the deportation consequence of a first-degree misdemeanor assault conviction is not ""truly clear"" under federal immigration law (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)), as assault ""may or may not involve moral turpitude."" Therefore, counsel was only required to advise the defendant that pleading guilty to assault might carry a risk of adverse immigration consequences. Since counsel's testimony, which the trial court found credible, indicated that she discussed the immigration consequences listed in the plea form with the defendant, her performance was not deficient. As such, no manifest injustice occurred to warrant withdrawing the guilty plea.","[]","['state v galdamez', 'state v dalton', 'state v pina', 'lovano v lynch', 'state v spates', 'barton v barr', 'state v cardenas', 'state v hale', 'padilla v kentucky', 'state v bozso', 'state v flores', 'state v xie', 'state v ray', 'state v miller', 'state v poppel', 'state v turner', 'state v leifheit', 'aaaa ents. inc. v river place community urban redevelopment corp.', 'state v ayesta', 'reyes v lynch', 'state v bradley', 'state v kreuzer', 'state v banks', 'state v ogletree', 'strickland v washington', 'state v darmond', 'state v muhire', 'state v saah', 'yeremin v holder', 'state v castro', 'state v riley', 'state v smith']","[]","[{'title': 'state v pierre', 'chunk': 'He asserted that he  had been “a limited English proficient individual” at the time of his plea.

"A software services company, ""GlobalTech Solutions,"" had its H-1B visa petition for a ""Senior Software Engineer"" denied by USCIS on the grounds that it failed to demonstrate the position was a ""specialty occupation"" and did not provide sufficient details on job duties. GlobalTech now seeks to intervene in an ongoing lawsuit filed by another company, ""Innovate Systems,"" whose H-1B petition for a ""Project Manager IT"" was also denied by USCIS for similar reasons (failure to prove specialty occupation and employment relationship). GlobalTech argues that both cases involve common questions of law under the APA regarding USCIS's arbitrary and capricious denials. Should the court grant GlobalTech Solutions' motion for permissive intervention under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b)?","No, the court should deny GlobalTech Solutions' motion for permissive intervention. Intervention would be inappropriate because it would result in undue delay and the two companies' cases are factually distinct. USCIS's review of H-1B visa petitions is fact-intensive and courts' review is limited to the administrative record. The two companies' petitions would not share a single piece of evidence in common, and the job positions, while broadly involving computer technology, would have significantly varying specific functional responsibilities (e.g., ""Senior Software Engineer"" versus ""Project Manager IT""). Furthermore, Innovate Systems' case likely involves an additional legal question (proving an employer-employee relationship) not present in GlobalTech's case, which could prove dispositive and adds complexity. Given these distinct factual and legal natures, reviewing separate agency decisions and records would inject unnecessary complexity and delay into the existing case.

"After being convicted of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud and ordered to pay over $200,000 in restitution, an individual is found removable as an aggravated felon. If this individual, while detained and proceeding pro se, files a petition for review of the BIA's order 31 days after it was mailed, can they successfully challenge the use of the restitution amount to establish the aggravated felony, or argue ineffective assistance of counsel in their immigration proceedings?","No, the individual in this situation would likely not successfully challenge the use of the restitution amount to establish the aggravated felony, nor could they argue ineffective assistance of counsel in their immigration proceedings if not properly raised before the BIA.

Firstly, the court would likely have jurisdiction to hear the petition for review, despite it being received 31 days after the BIA order was mailed, because the ""prison mailbox rule"" (Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 25(a)(2)(A)(iii)) applies to pro se detainees in immigration proceedings. This rule deems a filing timely if it is deposited in the institution's internal mail system on or before the last day for filing, with a compliant certificate of service or evidence of deposit.

Secondly, regarding the aggravated felony determination, a restitution order tied to a fraud conspiracy conviction, clearly showing a loss to victims exceeding $10,000, provides clear and convincing evidence to establish that the conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M). The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) is permitted to rely on such sentencing-related material to determine the amount of loss, and the individual's restitution order for $229,717.30 linked to their conviction would be sufficient evidence.

Finally, any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel concerning immigration proceedings cannot be considered by the court if the individual failed to first raise it before the BIA on direct appeal or in a motion to reopen. Failure to exhaust an issue before the BIA is a jurisdictional bar for the appellate court. Additionally, other unreasoned and unsupported claims would likely be considered abandoned.","[]","['arguelles-olivares v mukasey', 'goonsuwan v ashcroft', 'barrientos v lynch', 'omari v holder', 'shroff v sessions', 'smith v conner', 'avelar-oliva v barr', 'ouedraogo v ins', 'guirguis v ins', 'chun v ins', 'adon v holder', 'nijhawan v holder', 'zhu v gonzales', 'osei fosu v garland', 'rodriguez v barr', 'singh v sessions', 'stone v ins', 'arangoaradondo v ins', 'navarro-miranda v ashcroft', 'yang v holder', 'chavarria-reyes v lynch']","[]","[{'title': 'goonsuwan v ashcroft', 'chunk': 'Francis Osei Fosu, also known as Francis Pino Fosu, petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals order, following a conviction for conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud.

If the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denies his applications for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), stating that the harm was not severe enough due to lack of physical injury, that the nexus to his religion was insufficient as the gang's primary motive was extortion, and that the government's temporary safe house and facilitated departure demonstrated a willingness to protect him, how should a U.S. Court of Appeals review this decision?","The U.S. Court of Appeals should grant the petition for review, reverse the BIA's decision, and remand for further proceedings. The BIA misapplied prevailing case law by effectively requiring physical harm to establish persecution and by disregarding credible death threats and the attempt to kill the petitioner's son. It also erred in its nexus analysis by treating motive as an ""either-or"" proposition, failing to consider mixed motives (such as extortion coexisting with religious persecution) and one of the proposed particular social groups (Salvadoran informants against gang members). For the CAT claim, the BIA disregarded crucial evidence and failed to adequately support its decision that the Salvadoran government was willing and able to protect the petitioner, incorrectly interpreting temporary accommodation and facilitated departure as evidence of protection when authorities explicitly stated they could not ensure his safety and sought a liability waiver.","[]","['garland v ming dai', 'juan antonio v barr', 'blanco v atty gen.', 'morales lopez v garland', 'ponce-osorio v johnson', 'japarkulova v holder', 'jukic v ins', 'ruiz-perez v garland', 'martinez manzanares v barr', 'vazquez v sessions', 'herrera-reyes v atty gen.', 'johnson v guzman chavez', 'shaikh v holder', 'gomez-palacios v holder', 'morales v sessions', 'santos-zacaria v garland', 'roy v ashcroft', 'arulnanthy v garland', 'ontunez-tursios v ashcroft', 'berhe v barr', 'emmanuel-tata v garland', 'kolov v garland', 'orellana-monson v holder', 'eduard v ashcroft', 'garcia v holder', 'gjetani v barr', 'sealed petitioner v sealed respondent', 'ramirez-mejia v lynch', 'alonso-juarez v garland', 'zhu v gonzales', 'tech. automation servs. corp. v liberty surplus ins. corp.', 'wang v holder', 'cabrera v sessions', 'ins v stevic', 'rivas-martinez v i.n.s.', 'stone v ins', 'iruegas-valdez v yates', 'santos-alvarado v barr', 'arif v mukasey', 'efe v ashcroft', 'pena oseguera v barr', 'argueta-hernandez v garland', 'nasrallah v barr', 'arostegui-maldonado v garland', 'fei mei cheng v atty gen. of u.s.', 'hakim v holder', 'portillo flores v garland', 'gonzales-veliz v barr', 'mikhael v ins', 'carmen amanda barrios duenas v atty gen.']","[]","[{'title': 'negusie', 'chunk': 'IV.

"Can a U.S. federal court compel USCIS to reverse its discretionary denial of an employment authorization application (Form I-765) and approve it during the pendency of judicial review?","No, a U.S. federal court cannot compel USCIS to reverse its discretionary denial of an employment authorization application (Form I-765) and approve it during the pendency of judicial review. The denial of an I-765 application is committed to the discretion of USCIS by law, making it unreviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because there are no judicially manageable standards in the relevant statutes or regulations against which to judge USCIS's exercise of discretion. Furthermore, a request to reverse the denial and approve authorization is a mandatory injunction, which is an extraordinary remedy requiring a clear likelihood of success on the merits, a standard the plaintiff failed to meet. The court also cannot compel agency action (like reopening an I-765) under APA § 706(1) unless it's a discrete, ministerial, and non-discretionary duty, which is not the case for I-765 applications. Even if the I-765 denial were reviewable and erroneous, the error would be harmless as the plaintiff currently lacks a pending I-485 application, which is a prerequisite for I-765 approval.","[]","['mylan pharms. inc. v shalala', 'villafranca v cowan', 'district of columbia v u.s. dept of agric.', 'mazurek v armstrong', 'perales v casillas', 'winter v nat. res. def. council inc.', 'dickson v secy of def.', 'cuomo v u.s. nuclear reg. commn', 'vitarelli v seaton', 'king v leavitt', 'padula v webster', 'rosario v u.s. citizenship & immigr. servs.', 'heckler v chaney', 'suarez v cowan', 'univ. of tex. v camenisch', 'vemuri v napolitano', 'sherley v sebelius', 'aamer v obama', 'dorfmann v boozer', 'make the road n.y. v wolf', 'guevara v holder', 'w. org. of res. councils v zinke', 'weyerhaeuser co. v u.s. fish & wildlife serv.', 'abdullah v bush', 'kondapally v us citizenship and immigration services', 'steenholdt v faa', 'pursuing am.s greatness v fec', 'sierra club v johnson', 'city of moundridge v exxon mobil corp.', 'physicians for soc. resp. v wheeler', 'dallas safari club v bernhardt', 'daily caller v u.s. dept of state', 'kucana v holder', 'phillip v fairfield univ.', 'columbia hosp. for women found. inc. v bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ltd.', 'confederated tribes of chehalis rsrv. v mnuchin', 'paleteria la michoacana inc. v productos lacteos tocumbo s.a. de c.v.', 'salt pond assocs. v u.s. army corps. of engrs', 'league of women voters of u.s. v newby', 'norton v s. utah wilderness all.', 'kaddoura v gonzales', 'oryszak v sullivan', 'webster v doe']","[]","[{'title': 'sierra club v johnson', 'chunk': ""The court denied the plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction or relief pending review.

This jurisdictional strip applies unless the appeal involves reviewable constitutional claims or questions of law, which standardless discretionary decisions do not meet. Furthermore, the court lacks jurisdiction over claims of BIA procedural errors, such as an ultra vires act by a temporary board member, if the alien failed to exhaust all administrative remedies available as of right, specifically by not raising the issue in a motion to reconsider before the BIA. Lastly, if an alien appeals a BIA denial of a motion for reconsideration but forfeits essential arguments on appeal by not asserting them in their briefs, the court will dismiss the petition as any ruling on the preserved argument would be advisory.","[]","['niz-chavez v garland', 'castillo-gutierrez v garland', 'qorane v barr', 'goonsuwan v ashcroft', 'barton v barr', 'carachuri-rosendo v holder', 'toledo-hernandez v mukasey', 'omari v holder', 'roy v ashcroft', 'arulnanthy v garland', 'guerrero-lasprilla v barr', 'wang v ashcroft', 'ayala chapa v garland', 'tibakweitira v wilkinson', 'fakhuri v garland', 'nastase v barr', 'hernandez-castillo v sessions', 'falek v gonzales', 'morales-morales v barr', 'martinez-guevara v garland', 'monsonyem v garland', 'castillo-rodriguez v ins', 'patel v garland', 'mireles-valdez v ashcroft', 'moreira v mukasey', 'dale v holder']","[]","[{'title': 'dale v holder', 'chunk': ""The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed in part and denied in part Pardeep Kumar's petition for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals order regarding his asylum claims.""}, {'title': 'singh v garland', 'chunk': ""The court denied Marta Alicia Mejia-Alvarenga's petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals denial of her application for asylum.

"In a class action lawsuit against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) concerning its compliance with statutory obligations for the placement of young adults transitioning from unaccompanied alien children custody, a party seeks to introduce expert testimony from a statistician, a former agency administrator, and a pediatrician. What is the likelihood that the court will allow each expert to testify regarding the agency's compliance and the impact of its practices, based on similar expert challenges?","The court is likely to rule as follows:
1.  **Statistician (Qing Pan and Joseph Gastwirth)**: The court will deny a motion to exclude *certain opinions* of statisticians, allowing them to testify primarily on statistical methodology and data analysis. However, the court will caution that testimony not based on reliable statistical methods or straying into improper legal conclusions regarding ICE's statutory compliance will be given little weight. The court notes that it will entertain objections at trial.
2.  **Former Agency Administrator (Gary Mead)**: The court will grant a motion to exclude the testimony of a former agency administrator. The court finds that such testimony, which consists nearly entirely of legal conclusions about whether ICE is following the requirements of the statute, is inappropriate as expert testimony because it addresses the ultimate question before the court and would not assist the factfinder.
3.  **Pediatrician (Dr. Julie Linton)**: The court will deny a motion to exclude the testimony of a pediatrician. While her testimony on the physical and mental health-related effects of adult detention on immigrant teenagers may not touch on the central merits issues of statutory compliance, it is deemed relevant to the critical questions of remedies, specifically the four-factor test for injunctive relief (irreparable injury, adequacy of legal remedy, balance of hardships, and public interest).","[]","['barnes v district of columbia', 'luce v united states', 'chesapeake climate action network v export-import bank of the u.s.', 'daubert v merrell dow pharm. inc.', 'groobert v president & dirs. of georgetown coll.', 'joseph s. v hogan', 'nat. res. def. council v u.s. envtl prot. agency', 'mannino v intl mfg. co.', 'dl v district of columbia', 'khairkhwa v obama', 'u.s. ex rel. mossey v pal-tech inc.', 'williams v johnson', 'victorias secret stores brand mgmt. inc. v sexy hair concepts llc', 'kumho tire co. v carmichael', 'burkhart v wash. metro. area transit auth.', 'garcia ramirez v us immigration and custom enforcement']","[]","[{'title': 'judicial watch, inc. v food & drug admin.', 'chunk': ""The court case involves Nelson Mezerhane Gosen, a former Venezuelan television executive, against U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

"Can an immigrant investor successfully sue U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for unreasonable delay in adjudicating their Form I-526 petition under the Administrative Procedure Act or the Mandamus Act, given that the petition has been pending for approximately three to four years, the agency employs a visa availability and first-in, first-out processing method, and there is no binding statutory timetable for adjudication?","No, an immigrant investor cannot successfully sue USCIS for unreasonable delay under these circumstances. The court found that the TRAC factors, used to evaluate the reasonableness of agency delay, favored the defendants. Specifically:
1.  **Rule of Reason:** USCIS's ""visa availability"" and ""first-in, first-out"" processing method is a ""rule of reason"" and ""identifiable rationale"" that prioritizes applicants for whom visas are available, which courts in this District have consistently found reasonable. A three to four-year delay, while significant, falls within the range of what courts have deemed reasonable for immigration petitions in the absence of specific congressional guidance.
2.  **Statutory Timetable:** Congress has not imposed a binding statutory timetable for adjudicating Form I-526 petitions. The ""sense of Congress"" language regarding a 180-day processing goal is precatory, not mandatory.
3.  **Higher/Competing Priority:** Expediting the plaintiff's petition would reorder agency priorities and undermine USCIS's allocation of resources by moving the plaintiff ahead of other similarly situated applicants, which courts generally disfavor.
4.  **Human Health and Welfare/Interests Prejudiced:** The plaintiff's asserted hardships, such as an uncertain future or inability to obtain employment, are primarily economic and personal difficulties inherent to the application process, not the kind of serious health and welfare interests typically addressed by these factors.

The applicant argues that the I.J. erred by not following the procedures outlined in *Matter of L-A-C-*, which require an I.J. to first identify specific corroborating evidence, then give the applicant an opportunity to explain its absence, and finally state whether that explanation is sufficient. Did the I.J.'s actions in this case violate the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures?","No, the Immigration Judge's actions did not violate the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures in this case. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the petition for review, affirming the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision, which upheld the I.J.'s denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture (CAT) protection.

The Court held that the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures for identifying specific corroborating evidence and allowing an explanation for its absence apply only when the I.J. requires ""specific corroborating evidence"" and holds one missing piece of evidence to be the *sine qua non* to corroboration. In this case, the I.J. did not impose such a requirement. Instead, the I.J. engaged in a comprehensive analysis, finding that while the applicant's testimony was credible, it was not sufficiently corroborated by the evidence provided, and that other supporting documents would have been reasonably available. The I.J. specifically found the affidavits submitted by the applicant's wife, uncle, neighbor, and family lawyer insufficient because the affiants lacked personal knowledge of the recounted events. Other evidence, such as the applicant's injured foot and general country reports or newspaper articles, was deemed insufficient to compel a conclusion contrary to the I.J.'s finding of insufficient corroboration. The CAT claim was also denied for the same reason—lack of sufficient corroborating evidence.","[]","['ins v elias-zacarias', 'orellana-monson v holder', 'ins v aguirre-aguirre', 'yang v holder', 'arkansas v oklahoma', 'avelar-oliva v barr', 'chen v gonzales', 'sharma v holder', 'mikhael v ins', 'negusie v holder', 'mohndamenang v garland', 'wang v holder', 'singh v gonzales']","[]","[{'title': 'bustamante-leiva v garland', 'chunk': 'We DENY their petitions.

1.  **Substantive Claims (Asylum, Withholding of Removal, CAT, BIA's factual conclusions, and denial of motion to remand):** These claims were denied because the BIA's factual findings and conclusions were supported by substantial evidence; the evidence did not compel a contrary conclusion that the harm endured amounted to persecution or torture, that the BJP was the Indian government, that the national identification system prevented relocation, or that the medical evaluation supported his claims of BJP attacks. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to remand because the new evidence would not have changed the outcome.
2.  **Due Process Claims:** These claims were denied because Kumar failed to show substantial prejudice, as the alleged errors (discrepancy in the record, failure to advise on medical evaluation/declaration, and denial of continuance) would not have affected the outcome of the proceedings.
3.  **Meaningful Consideration Claims:** These claims were denied because the BIA's decision sufficiently reflected a meaningful consideration of the relevant evidence, referencing the testimony and affidavits Kumar alleged were mischaracterized.","[]","['khadiwal v lynch', 'dale v holder', 'qorane v barr', 'goonsuwan v ashcroft', 'ramchandani v gonzales', 'omari v holder', 'kumar v garland', 'avelar-oliva v barr', 'morales v sessions', 'roy v ashcroft', 'singh v whitaker', 'munoz-granados v barr', 'martinez-lopez v barr', 'ogunfuye v holder', 'chun v ins', 'orellana-monson v holder', 'eduard v ashcroft', 'gjetani v barr', 'wang v ashcroft', 'okpala v whitaker', 'cabrera v sessions', 'cardona-franco v garland', 'santos-alvarado v barr', 'ins v elias-zacarias', 'efe v ashcroft', 'abdel-masieh v ins', 'chen v gonzales', 'martinez-guevara v garland', 'mikhael v ins', 'suate-orellana v barr', 'mireles-valdez v ashcroft', 'tesfamichael v gonzales']","[]","[{'title': 'ruiz-perez v garland', 'chunk': ""The court considered the case of Samuel De Jesus Argueta-Hernandez, who sought review of the Board of Immigration Appeals’ (BIA) denial of his application for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).

We consider each argument. A. Spagnol-Bastos argues that the BIA abused its discretion by concluding that he forfeited his right to notice of the court hearing because he failed to correct an address error unknown to him and by failing to adequately consider his affidavit testimony. Neither argument is persuasive. 1 An alien subject to removal proceedings is generally entitled to a written notice that, among other things, specifies the time and place of the removal proceedings and the consequences for failing to appear for those proceedings. 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1). Failing to appear at removal proceedings carries a severe penalty: An immigration court must order removal in absentia of an absent alien who received written notice if the government “establishes by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the written notice was so provided and that the alien is removable.”  1 The parties also dispute whether Spagnol-Bastos needed to notify the immigration court of his new address independently of INS officials.

"An individual who has been a lawful permanent resident (LPR) for over five years, but whose initial admission to the U.S. as an ""accompanying"" relative was procedurally flawed because they arrived before the principal immigrant, applies for naturalization.

The fact that the five-year statute of limitations for rescinding LPR status has run does not mean the initial entry was lawful or that the individual is eligible for naturalization; it only prevents the government from instituting rescission proceedings.

They seek to use the visa fraud waiver available under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H) to waive this ground of removability. Can this specific waiver be applied to overcome removability based on a criminal conviction under § 1227(a)(3)(B)(iii)?","No, the visa fraud waiver under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(H) cannot waive a ground for removability based on a criminal conviction under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(3)(B)(iii). The § 1227(a)(1)(H) waiver is explicitly limited to ""The provisions of this paragraph"" (referring to § 1227(a)(1)) and applies only to aliens inadmissible due to fraud or misrepresentation under § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), which does not involve a conviction. The ground for removability under § 1227(a)(3)(B)(iii) results directly from a criminal conviction for visa fraud, a distinct charge from inadmissibility due to unprosecuted fraud or misrepresentation. The petitioners also failed to demonstrate a violation of their due process rights. Claims regarding eligibility for hardship waivers or the ability to ""stack"" waivers were not addressed by the Board of Immigration Appeals and, therefore, the court lacked jurisdiction to review them, finding no realistic possibility that a remand would lead to a different conclusion given the unappealable ground for removability.","[]","['i.n.s. v errico', 'anwar v i.n.s.', 'chevron u.s.a. inc. v nat. res. def. council inc.', 'tima v atty gen.', 'herrera gonzalez v rosen', 'gourche v holder', 'fayzullina v holder', 'taggar v holder', 'koons buick pontiac gmc inc. v nigh', 'lopez-perez v garland', 'vasquez v holder', 'animashaun v i.n.s.', 'reese v garland', 'singh v sessions', 'dhuka v holder', 'rodriguez-avalos v holder', 'efe v ashcroft', 'garcia-carias v holder', 'reno v flores', 'luna-garcia v barr', 'castillo-rodriguez v i.n.s.', 'miranda-lores v i.n.s.', 'judulang v holder', 'united states v batchelder', 'siwe v holder']","[]","[{'title': 'patel v u.s. att’y gen.', 'chunk': 'Patel v.

"A public interest organization submits a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to a federal agency, seeking all complaint records filed against its administrative judges. The agency responds by disclosing thousands of pages of documents, but with two types of redactions: (1) all administrative judges' names are redacted, with the agency arguing a blanket privacy interest under FOIA Exemption 6, and (2) discrete sentences or paragraphs within otherwise responsive complaint records are redacted, with the agency asserting that this information is ""non-responsive"" to the request, even if it does not fall under any FOIA exemption. The organization challenges both categories of redactions in court. How should a court rule on these challenges based on the provided case?","Based on the case ruling, the court should rule as follows:
1.  **Redaction of judges' names under Exemption 6:** The agency's categorical, across-the-board redaction of all administrative judges' names would likely be deemed inadequately justified. FOIA Exemption 6 does not categorically exempt individuals' identities, as the privacy and public interests at stake can vary depending on factors such as whether the judge is sitting or retired, the seriousness and number of complaints, and the potential for public understanding of government operations through disclosure. A more individualized inquiry, or a particularized showing for defined subgroups of judges, is required to properly balance the privacy interests against the public interest in disclosure.
2.  **Redaction of non-responsive information within responsive records:** The court should find no statutory basis for redacting ostensibly non-responsive information from a record once that record has been deemed responsive to a FOIA request. Under the statutory framework, once an agency identifies a record as responsive, the sole basis for withholding information within that record is if the information falls within one of FOIA's nine statutory exemptions. Redacting non-exempt information on the basis of non-responsiveness within an otherwise responsive record is not permitted by the statute.","[]","['am. immigration lawyers assn v exec. office for immigration review', 'u.s. dept of justice v reporters comm. for freedom of press', 'common cause v irs', 'american immigration lawyers assn v executive office for immigration review', 'armstrong v exec. office of the president', 'milner v dept of navy', 'nlrb v sears roebuck & co.', 'citizens for responsibility & ethics in wash. v u.s. dept of justice crew i', 'leeds v commr of patents & trademarks', 'multi ag media llc v dept of agric.', 'united states v landano', 'gallant v nlrb', 'prison legal news v samuels', 'assassination archives & research ctr. v cia', 'natl assn of home builders v norton', 'skelton v united states postal service', 'vietnam veterans of amer. v dept of navy', 'vaughn v rosen', 'larson v dept of state', 'judicial watch inc. v food & drug admin.', 'schrecker v u.s. dept of justice']","[]","[{'title': 'garcia ramirez v us immigration and custom enforcement', 'chunk': 'SO ORDERED.

"A U.S. company, ""InnovateTech Inc."", seeks to extend an H-1B visa for its foreign citizen employee, who works as a ""Lead Software Architect"" at a client site through a subcontracting arrangement. USCIS denies the extension, citing (1) a lack of sufficiently detailed, non-speculative day-to-day work assignments for the entire visa period, (2) perceived inconsistencies in the minimum degree requirements stated across different application documents (e.g., ""bachelor's degree in a computer-related field"" vs. ""bachelor's or higher degree in Information Technology or Computer Science""), and (3) insufficient evidence to prove InnovateTech has ""actual control"" over the employee's specific tasks at the client site, despite InnovateTech providing documentation confirming its exclusive right to hire, pay, fire, and supervise the employee. InnovateTech had also referenced the Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook to argue that a ""Lead Software Architect"" position typically requires a bachelor's degree in a specific specialty, but USCIS did not address this argument in its denial. Can InnovateTech successfully challenge this denial under the Administrative Procedure Act?","Yes, InnovateTech can likely successfully challenge the denial. Based on the provided court ruling, USCIS's denial would be considered arbitrary and capricious for several reasons. First, requiring detailed evidence of non-speculative day-to-day work assignments for the entire visa duration and focusing a ""searching inquiry into the specific services"" goes against established legal precedent regarding the ""specialty occupation"" requirement. Second, USCIS's failure to meaningfully consider or even mention InnovateTech's argument that the position is akin to an occupation described in the Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook, which could satisfy the specialty occupation criteria, renders the decision arbitrary and capricious. Third, USCIS's demand for evidence of ""actual control"" over the employee's work and duties beyond the ability to hire, pay, or fire, when InnovateTech has provided evidence of the legal right to control these factors, is inconsistent with regulatory language that states these factors are independently sufficient to establish an employer-employee relationship. The court would likely grant InnovateTech's motion for summary judgment and remand the case for reconsideration consistent with these principles.","[]","['at&t inc. v fcc', 'auer v robbins', 'recording indus. assn of am. inc. v librarian of congress', 'ardmore consulting grp. inc. v contreras-sweet', 'motor vehicle mfrs. assn of u.s. inc. v state farm mut. auto. ins.', 'innova sols. inc. v baran', 'itserve all. inc. v cissna', 'stellar it solutions inc v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'ctr. for food safety v salazar', 'taylor made software inc. v cuccinelli', 'pam squared at texarkana llc v azar', 'bnsf ry. co. v surface transp. bd.', 'kaiser found. hosps. v sebelius', 'agape church inc. v fcc', 'stellar it sols. inc. v u.s. citizenship and immigration servs.']","[]","[{'title': 'gona v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'chunk': 'See 8    C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(2)(i)(H).

"An individual, native and citizen of Mexico, is ordered removed from the U.S. after being convicted in Texas of aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon.

Aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon under Texas law is considered a crime of violence and, therefore, an aggravated felony for purposes of federal immigration law because it requires the intentional or knowing use or attempted use of physical force with a deadly weapon. The Texas offense requires the use or exhibition of a deadly weapon in a manner that facilitates the associated felony, satisfying the federal definition of a crime of violence. Consequently, an individual convicted of this offense is removable.

"My client was lawfully present in the U.S. on an H1B visa but was convicted of conspiracy to commit money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h), involving over $10,000. He fears he will be found removable as an aggravated felon and wants to know if there are any grounds to challenge this or seek a waiver of inadmissibility, especially considering his claim that his conviction did not require proof of an overt act. He also believes his removal proceedings were flawed due to a defective notice to appear and missing hearing transcripts. What does the law say about his situation, particularly regarding the definition of an aggravated felony and his eligibility for relief?","The court denied the petition for review in part and dismissed it in part. The court affirmed that a conviction for conspiracy to commit money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) involving funds exceeding $10,000 plainly constitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(D), making the individual removable. It was deemed unnecessary to address whether such a conviction also qualified under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(U) or required proof of an overt act.
Regarding the claim for a waiver of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), the court dismissed this petition for lack of jurisdiction because the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not raising the ""overt act"" argument concerning inadmissibility before the BIA. Additionally, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(I)(ii), which covers knowing conspirators in money laundering offenses, is not among the provisions for which waivers are available under § 1182(h).
The due process challenge concerning allegedly missing hearing transcripts was denied because the petitioner failed to demonstrate any substantial prejudice. Lastly, the argument that the immigration authorities lacked jurisdiction due to a defective notice to appear, based on *Pereira v. Sessions*, was denied, as the court reiterated that its precedent holds *Pereira* and *Niz-Chavez v.

"Can a foreign investor compel U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to expedite the processing of their Form I-526 application for an EB-5 immigrant visa, alleging an unreasonable 30-month delay that has led to mental and physical health issues, when USCIS follows a visa availability approach and Congress has not set a binding timeline for such adjudications?","No, a foreign investor cannot compel USCIS to expedite processing under these circumstances.

"Is sexual solicitation of a minor, in violation of section 3-324(b) of the Maryland Criminal Law, categorically a crime involving moral turpitude, and how does this affect an alien's eligibility for cancellation of removal, particularly concerning the mental state required regarding the victim's age?","Sexual solicitation of a minor in violation of section 3-324(b) of the Maryland Criminal Law with the intent to engage in an unlawful sexual offense under section 3-307 is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude, even when the statute requires no culpable mental state as to the age of the child. The Board of Immigration Appeals reaffirmed this position, clarifying that a sexual offense targeting very young victims (under 14, or under 16 with a significant age differential) is a CIMT due to inherent antisocial and depraved nature, regardless of a mistake of age defense. However, in light of the Fourth Circuit's view that the Board's prior decision represented a change in position, this holding will be applied prospectively in the Fourth Circuit.

"Under U.S. federal immigration law, can a former government employee of a foreign country's prison system, who received military training and monitored inmates, establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal based on a fear of persecution from criminal gangs, if the perceived threat stems from the nature of their former employment rather than an immutable characteristic, a protected social group, or a statutorily recognized political opinion?","The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied the petition for review, affirming the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision that the petitioner, a former employee of El Salvador's Ministry of Justice, was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal. The court concluded that substantial evidence supported the BIA's finding that the petitioner failed to show the requisite nexus between the harm she feared and suffered and a protected statutory ground. The court agreed that her role, which included monitoring prisoners via video, receiving military training, wearing a uniform and mask, and being identified by gangs due to her employment, meant the dangers she faced arose from the nature of her employment and domestic unrest, not from a protected ground, consistent with *Matter of Fuentes*. Furthermore, the court rejected her argument of an imputed anti-gang political opinion, noting that ""pro rule-of-law, anti-corruption, and anti-gang"" is not a recognized political opinion for asylum and that criminally-motivated actions (such as gangs seeking to exploit her work-related access and knowledge) do not constitute persecution on account of a protected ground.

"Can a U.S. federal agency refuse to fulfill a broadly worded FOIA request seeking all emails from high-ranking officials over a period of several months if the agency determines that the effort required for review, redaction, and production is unduly burdensome, even if the request describes the documents with sufficient precision to locate them?","Yes, a U.S. federal agency can refuse such a request. Binding precedent in the D.C.

The Court found this burden too high, particularly because the requests were not tailored to specific policy concerns, thus requiring the agency to process thousands of documents with no conceivable relation to the requester's stated interest (e.g., workplace emails about miscellaneous topics or health care plans). The Court also noted the risk of severe interference with the agency's IT systems due to the large data transfer.

"A manufacturing company, facing numerous charges for failing to verify employee work authorization and knowingly continuing to employ unauthorized aliens, seeks to overturn an administrative law judge's decision. The company argues that it acted in good faith by hiring a purportedly qualified HR director whose negligence led to the violations. It also claims that many violations are barred by the five-year statute of limitations. Furthermore, the company challenges the summarily imposed civil penalties, arguing that its severe financial distress (including significant net losses and pending bankruptcy) constitutes a material factual dispute regarding its ability to pay, which should have precluded summary determination of the penalty amount. How would a federal court likely rule on each of these arguments?","A federal court would likely rule as follows:
1.  **Good Faith Defense:** The court would likely reject the good faith defenses. The defense under 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(a)(3) applies only to knowing *hiring* violations, not *continuing employment* or *paperwork* violations. The defense under 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(6) is limited to *technical or procedural* failures, not substantive ones, and the HR director's failure to perform their duties would be properly imputed to the company as its agent.
2.  **Statute of Limitations (General):** The court would likely reject a generalized statute of limitations defense for most violations if it was not properly asserted with a statement of facts as required by 28 C.F.R. § 68.9(c). For paperwork violations, the five-year limitations period is measured from when the company was no longer required to retain the I-9 form (three years after hire or one year after termination, whichever is later). For continuing employment violations, it is measured from the last day of the ineligible alien's employment.
3.  **Statute of Limitations (Specific Untimely Claim):** However, the court would likely grant the petition for review as to a specific violation if the claim accrued more than five years before the administrative action was commenced (e.g., employment ended before the five-year window) and the agency itself had conceded the untimeliness. The limitations period begins when the claim first accrued, not when the penalty is administratively imposed.
4.  **Summary Determination of Penalty:** The court would likely uphold the summary determination of the penalty. While ""ability to pay"" is a factor that an ALJ may consider at their discretion, it is not one of the five mandatory factors listed in 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(e)(5). Because it is within the ALJ's power to decline to consider this factor at all, the company's ability to pay is not considered a *material* issue of fact that would preclude summary determination of the penalty amount. The ALJ's decision to proceed despite ambiguities in financial evidence would be considered an implicit choice to give that factor no weight, and this does not warrant reversal. The court would also typically uphold the ALJ's consideration of the statutory factors (size of business, good faith, seriousness of violations, whether the employee is an unauthorized alien, and history of previous violations) if the penalty falls within the prescribed monetary range and is reasonably based on the evidence presented.","[]","['federal election commission v williams', 'dls precision fab llc v us immigration & customs enforcement', 'united states v curran engg co.', 'united states v deleon valenzuela', 'united states v.', 'united states v m.t.s. serv. corp.', 'sec v mohn', 'united states v romans racing stables inc.', 'bosma v u.s. dept of agric.', 'anderson v liberty lobby inc.', 'order of r.r. telegraphers v ry. express agency inc.', 'cts corp. v waldburger', 'ketchikan drywall servs. inc. v immigration & customs enft', 'united states v meyer', 'united states v dominguez', 'getahun v o.c.a.h.o.', 'united states. v snack attack deli inc.', 'united states v primera enters. inc.']","[]","[{'title': 'garcia ramirez v us immigration and custom enforcement', 'chunk': 'SO ORDERED.

"Under U.S. federal law, can an individual asylum seeker successfully sue federal officials in their individual capacities for money damages based on constitutional violations stemming from a family separation policy, or obtain declaratory and injunctive relief against such policies from federal agencies and officials in their official capacities, after being reunited with their child and the policy being altered and enjoined?","The court would dismiss claims against federal officials in their individual capacities for money damages.

Claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against federal agencies and officials in their official capacities would be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to mootness.

"A group of international students, who were unknowingly enrolled in a sham university created by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as part of a sting operation, received letters terminating their F-1 nonimmigrant student status due to ""fraudulent enrollment."" They filed a class action lawsuit challenging this termination under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging due process violations, and seeking an order preventing the government from deeming their enrollment fraudulent. The District Court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that the termination was not a final agency action and the case was not ripe for review because reinstatement proceedings were pending or removal proceedings could provide administrative relief. Are the students' claims for judicial review of the F-1 visa termination a final agency action and ripe for review, despite the availability of reinstatement applications or the potential for future removal proceedings?","Yes, the students' claims for judicial review of the F-1 visa termination are a final agency action and ripe for review. The termination of their F-1 visas constituted a final agency action because there is no statutory or regulatory requirement that a student seek reinstatement, and reinstatement proceedings do not provide a mechanism to review the original termination order or the propriety of the ""fraudulent enrollment"" decision. Unlike asylum terminations, the F-1 termination was the culmination, not the initiation, of the agency's decision-making process. Furthermore, the students are not required to wait for removal proceedings to be instituted, as such proceedings may never occur, and immigration judges and the Board of Immigration Appeals lack the authority to review USCIS's discretionary denial of reinstatement. The case is also ripe for review because the parties are in a sufficiently adversarial posture, the students are genuinely aggrieved by the termination of their lawful status and the notation of fraud on their records, and the government's inconsistent position on the students' culpability underscores the need for judicial review that would otherwise be unavailable.","[]","['hosseini v johnson', 'tooloee v ins', 'babbitt v united farm workers natl union', 'qureshi v holder', 'young dong kim v holder', 'ftc v standard oil co. of cal.', 'jie fang v dir us immigration & customs enforcement', 'ghorbani v ins', 'palakovic v wetzel', 'bennett v spear', 'pinho v gonzales', 'felmeister v office of attorney ethics', 'cabaccang v uscis', 'peachlum v city of york', 'darby v cisneros', 'kashani v nelson', 'marathon petroleum corp. v secy of finance']","[]","[{'title': 'aguilar-mendez', 'chunk': 'The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s request for voluntary departure.

"A Ukrainian national, paroled into the U.S. in 2022, brought an Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claim against USCIS for unlawfully charging a $410 filing fee for employment authorization.

Despite this, the court still dismissed the APA claim.

These alternatives could offer the monetary relief (a refund) that the plaintiff sought and allow for review of the challenged agency action to the same extent as an APA case. The court reasoned that a monetary award would necessarily be predicated on a finding of legal error by the agency, effectively forcing the agency to cease its unlawful practice, making these alternatives adequate even if they didn't explicitly provide declaratory relief.","[]","['bagherian v pompeo', 'united states v.', 'bell atl. corp. v twombly', 'ashcroft v iqbal', 'scheuer v rhodes', 'perry capital llc v mnuchin', 'didban v pompeo', 'am. natl ins. v fdic', 'astakhov v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'lujan v defs. of wildlife', 'garcia v vilsack', 'bowen v massachusetts']","[]","[{'title': 'munoz-de zelaya v garland', 'chunk': 'The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the petition for review in the immigration case Munoz-De Zelaya v.

"Can a noncitizen residing outside the U.S. successfully sue the government for unreasonable delay in processing a worker's visa application, citing violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause, when the delay is primarily attributed to a global pandemic and the applicant seeks initial entry?","No. The court dismissed the claims, finding that some defendants (USCIS, its Director, and the Secretary of State) were moot because they lacked the authority to provide the requested relief. Regarding the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claim, the court determined that an eighteen-month (or even two-year) delay in scheduling a visa interview was not unreasonable as a matter of law, especially given the ""substantial backlogs"" caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the government's efforts to protect public health. Applying the TRAC factors, the court noted that Congress sets no statutory deadline for visa processing, the prejudice alleged was primarily financial rather than health-related, and expediting the applicant's case would merely reorder the queue without net gain. Concerning the Due Process claim, the court held that a noncitizen seeking initial admission to the United States has no constitutional rights under the Due Process Clause regarding their application, as the power to admit or exclude noncitizens is a sovereign prerogative and their only procedural rights are those conferred by statute.","[]","['palakuru v renaud', 'dept of homeland sec. v thuraissigiam', 'baan rao thai rest. v pompeo', 'skalka v kelly', 'hulli v mayorkas', 'sparrow v united air lines inc.', 'legal assistance for vietnamese asylum seekers v dept of state', 'dastagir v blinken', 'shaughnessy v united states ex rel. mezei', 'landon v plasencia', 'khanom v kerry', 'kowal v mci commcns corp.', 'oil chemical and atomic workers intern. union v zegeer', 'khushnood v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'sarlak v pompeo', 'ashcroft v iqbal', 'ghadami v dept of homeland sec.', 'conservation force inc. v jewell', 'iron arrow honor socy v heckler', 'bagherian v pompeo', 'united states ex rel. knauff v shaughnessy', 'tate v pompeo', 'scheuer v rhodes', 'mashpee wampanoag tribal council inc. v norton', 'nishimura ekiu v united states', 'new vision photography program inc. v district of columbia']","[]","[{'title': 'hidalgo v fbi', 'chunk': 'Hidalgo v.

"Under what circumstances will a U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia transfer a case challenging a USCIS visa denial to another district, particularly when the plaintiff chose the D.C. forum but the administrative decision was made elsewhere?","A U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia will transfer a case challenging a USCIS visa denial to another district, such as the District of Nebraska, when the balance of private and public interest factors strongly favors the transferee forum. In such cases, the court will grant a motion to transfer pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), concluding that the case ""might have been brought"" in the transferee court and that transfer is ""in the interest of justice.""

Specifically, the court considers:
1.  **Propriety of Venue in Transferee Court:** Venue is proper in the transferee court if, under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e), a defendant resides there, a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred there, or the plaintiff resides there. For cases challenging USCIS decisions, venue is typically proper in the district where the relevant service center (e.g., Nebraska Service Center) is located and processed the petition, or where the plaintiff resides.
2.  **Balancing of Private Interest Factors:**
    *   **Plaintiff's Choice of Forum:** The deference given to the plaintiff's choice of forum is significantly reduced when it is not the plaintiff's home forum and lacks meaningful ties to the controversy. If the administrative decision being challenged was made in another district, the D.C. court will give ""nadir"" deference to the plaintiff's choice to sue in D.C.
    *   **Defendant's Choice of Forum:** This choice gains some deference, especially when the defendants seek transfer to the plaintiff's home forum or where the claim arose.
    *   **Where the Claim Arose:** This is a predominant factor. In Administrative Procedure Act (APA) cases challenging agency action, the claim generally arises where the decision-making process occurred. If the visa petition was processed, adjudicated, and denied by a USCIS service center in another district (e.g., Nebraska), then the claim arose in that district, not D.C., even if general agency policies were formulated in D.C., unless there are credible allegations of direct, case-specific involvement by D.C.-based officials.
    *   **Convenience of Parties, Witnesses, and Access to Proof:** Convenience factors typically favor the district where the plaintiff resides (if applicable) or, more strongly, the district where the administrative record is located and where the agency personnel involved in the challenged decision reside, as APA cases are generally resolved on the administrative record.
3.  **Balancing of Public Interest Factors:**
    *   **Familiarity with Governing Laws:** This factor is neutral for federal law cases as all federal courts are presumed equally familiar.
    *   **Relative Congestion of Calendars:** While current statistics might slightly favor D.C. in terms of caseload, this factor is often a ""wash"" due to the difficulty of accurate assessment and the concern about future congestion if D.C. retains cases with little connection to the district.
    *   **Local Interest in Resolving the Controversy:** This is the ""most important"" public factor. The district where the challenged decision was made (e.g., Nebraska Service Center) has the strongest local interest, especially if the relief sought involves compelling specific actions in that district. A case challenging a single visa petition's denial is typically not considered one of ""national significance.""

In sum, the court will transfer the case to the district where the administrative decision was made and where the bulk of the administrative record and relevant agency personnel are located, finding it to be the optimal venue when D.C. lacks meaningful ties to the specific controversy.","[]","['cameron v thornburgh', 'trout unlimited v u.s. dept of agric.', 'huskey v quinlan', 'united states v.', 'stewart org. inc. v ricoh corp.', 'wolfram alpha llc v cuccinelli', 'pasem v uscis', 'ike v uscis', 'gyau v sessions', 'bahena v renaud', 'lamont v haig', 'aracely v nielsen', 'efficientip inc. v cuccinelli no.', 'fed. hous. fin. agency v first tenn. bank natl assn', 'stewart v azar', 'pengbo li v miller no.', 'ngonga v sessions', 'abusadeh v chertoff no.', 'melnattur v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'aishat v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'bourdon v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'aftab v gonzalez', 'greater yellowstone coal. v bosworth', 'norton v s. utah wilderness all.']","[]","[{'title': 'friends of animals v u.s. bureau of land mgmt.', 'chunk': 'Friends of Animals v.

"Apex Construction Inc. hired several new employees. For some, the employees signed Section 1 of the I-9 Form but failed to check the box indicating their specific work authorization status (e.g., U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident). For others, Apex completed Section 2 but failed to list the issuing authority for a driver's license presented as proof of identity. Apex had photocopied all identity and work authorization documents and kept them in a separate folder, believing that the copies, combined with the employee's signature, fulfilled its obligations. During an ICE inspection, these issues were flagged. Apex later produced the copied documents during the administrative hearing, arguing they cured the I-9 deficiencies and showed good faith. Apex now faces civil penalties. Based on the *Ketchikan Drywall Services* decision, how should a court evaluate Apex Construction Inc.'s arguments regarding its I-9 compliance, the nature of its violations, and the potential for penalty mitigation?","Based on the *Ketchikan Drywall Services* decision, Apex Construction Inc.'s arguments would likely be rejected, and the penalties upheld. The court would find that employers must fully complete I-9 Forms, and merely copying and retaining verification documents is neither necessary nor sufficient for compliance, nor does it relieve the employer of the requirement to fully complete Section 2. The regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 274a.2(b)(3), clarifies that copying and retention do not relieve the employer from fully completing Section 2, superseding any prior interpretations to the contrary.

Regarding the specific violations:
1.  **Failure to check a specific box in Section 1:** This is considered a ""substantive"" verification failure under the Virtue Memorandum (which the court grants Skidmore deference). Employees are required to attest to a specific category of eligibility, and failure to check the appropriate box means the statutory requirement (8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(2)) is unfulfilled, regardless of whether other documentation might allow ICE to deduce the employee's status. Employers are responsible for ensuring Section 1 is completely filled out by employees.
2.  **Failure to list the issuing authority for a List B document (e.g., driver's license) in Section 2:** This is a substantive failure. Employers have an obligation to fill out Section 2 of their I-9 Forms ""fully,"" and the absence of the issuing authority constitutes a failure to identify the document utilized, even if ICE might deduce the information from other details.

The court would likely find that the late production of copied documents during the administrative hearing cannot cure substantive deficiencies. The Virtue Memorandum only excuses certain substantive deficiencies where the missing information is found ""on a legible copy of a document retained *with* the Form I-9 and *presented at the I-9 inspection*."" Documents not presented at the initial I-9 inspection do not qualify. The penalties are imposed for substantive deficiencies on the I-9 Forms themselves, not for the manner or timing of document storage or production.

Finally, concerning penalty mitigation, the ALJ has broad discretion. A refusal to mitigate for ""good faith"" would be permissible if, for example, Apex had a history of non-compliance or demonstrated a lack of timely effort to ascertain and conform to the law. Similarly, a refusal to mitigate for ""non-seriousness"" would be upheld, as the penalties are for substantive deficiencies in the I-9 Forms.","[]","['bosma v u.s. dept of agric.', 'eeoc v first citizens bank of billings', 'united states v manos & assocs. inc.', 'christensen v harris county', 'united states v pegasus rest. inc.', 'united states v carter', 'ketchikan drywall services inc v immigration & customs enforcement', 'balice v u.s. dept of agric.', 'united states v j.j.l.c. inc. ta richfield caterers', 'skidmore v swift & co.', 'judulang v holder', 'montero-martinez v ashcroft', 'united states v wsc plumbing inc.', 'united states v candlelight inn', 'united states v mead corp.']","[]","[{'title': 'mckenzie v us citizenship & immigration services', 'chunk': '50475, 50496 (Oct. 7, 1991).

"An individual has legally resided in the U.S. for years, is married to an H-1B visa holder with a pending green card application, and has her H-4 nonimmigrant status and Employment Authorization Document (EAD) renewal applications pending with USCIS. Her EAD has expired due to USCIS processing delays, causing her to lose her job and driver's license. She seeks a preliminary injunction to compel USCIS to immediately adjudicate her applications. Based on the *TRAC* factors for unreasonable delay, is she likely to succeed on the merits of her claim and thus be granted a preliminary injunction?","No, the individual is not likely to succeed on the merits of her claim and thus will not be granted a preliminary injunction. The court found that USCIS's delay in adjudicating her applications was not sufficiently unreasonable *at present*. Applying the *TRAC* factors:
1.  **Rule of Reason:** USCIS's ""first-in, first-out"" processing system was considered a rule of reason, favoring defendants.
2.  **Congressional Timetable:** While 8 U.S.C. § 1571(b) suggests processing within 180 days (six months), the plaintiff's applications had been pending for less than four months when the decision was made, so this factor favored defendants *for the moment*.
3.  **Human Health and Welfare / Interests Prejudiced:** These factors favored the plaintiff, acknowledging the significant hardship beyond mere economic harm, including loss of employment, inability to drive, and potential impact on her new restaurant's employees, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
4.  **Effect on Competing Priorities:** This factor favored defendants. Granting relief would place the plaintiff ahead of other similarly situated applicants facing delays due to USCIS backlogs in biometrics scheduling, merely reordering the queue without addressing the systemic issue.
Considering these factors as a whole, the court concluded that the rule of reason, the fact that the six-month congressional window had not yet elapsed, and the concern about reordering the queue outweighed the substantial hardships to the plaintiff, meaning the delay was not yet ""so egregious as to warrant mandamus"" or APA relief.","[]","['konchitsky v chertoff', 'emergency coal. to defend educ. travel v dept of treasury', 'mazurek v armstrong', 'winter v nat. res. def. council inc.', 'nibber v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'natl assn of mfrs. v sec', 'islam v heinauer', 'archdiocese of wash. v wash. metro. area. transit auth.', 'gonzales v cissna', 'univ. of tex. v camenisch', 'davis v pension benefit guar. corp.', 'sherley v sebelius', 'aamer v obama', 'a.c.c.s. v nielsen', 'ray v cuccinelli', 'pursuing am.s greatness v fec', 'gonzales v o centro espirita beneficente união do vegetal', 'muvvala v wolf', 'khan v johnson', 'am. hosp. assn v burwell', 'uranga v u.s. citizenship & immigr. servs.', 'mashpee wampanoag tribal council inc. v norton', 'league of women voters of u.s. v newby', 'norton v s. utah wilderness all.', 'liberty fund inc. v chao', 'munaf v geren', 'singh v carter']","[]","[{'title': 'stellar it solutions inc v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'chunk': 'An order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion is separately and  contemporaneously issued.

"If a Mexican citizen, who publicly campaigned against the Mexican Navy following the disappearance of her son, had her vacant home ransacked and observed Navy vehicles drive by her house once, but experienced no direct threats or further incidents, would she and her minor children be entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention Against Torture in the U.S. based on past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution?","No, the petitioners would not be entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention Against Torture.
The court denied the petition for review, affirming the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision.

1.  **Asylum:**
    *   **Past Persecution:** The BIA did not err in finding no past persecution. The ransacking of the vacant home was a singular event that did not cause serious or permanent damage and was more akin to ""abusive or harassing treatment"" than ""extreme conduct"" required for persecution. The incidents (ransacking and Navy vehicles driving by) did not create a threat sufficiently menacing or imminent to amount to persecution. Rangel had publicly campaigned against the Navy for four months without physical harm or direct threats, and the alleged threat lacked the ""organized, relentless campaign of intimidation"" found in cases compelling a finding of persecution.
    *   **Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution:** The BIA did not err. Petitioners failed to establish past persecution, thus were not entitled to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear. Rangel had publicly campaigned against the Navy for four months without suffering physical harm, threats, or reprisals until the ransacking, and no further threats took place after that incident. There was no indication the Navy remained interested in or actively searching for petitioners, and the disappearance of Rangel's other son was determined to be unrelated to her campaigning.

2.  **Withholding of Removal:** The BIA did not err. Withholding of removal is a higher standard than asylum. Since petitioners failed to demonstrate they suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution for asylum, they necessarily failed to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.

3.  **Convention Against Torture (CAT) Relief:** The BIA did not err. Torture is a higher bar than persecution. Since the basis for relief advanced by petitioners did not even rise to the level of persecution, it follows a fortiori that it does not constitute torture. Additionally, the minor children's claims, based entirely on Rangel's experiences, independently failed as they would not be personally at risk of torture.","[]","['zho v gonzales', 'zhao v gonzales', 'escobar-chavez v i.n.s.', 'liu v ashcroft', 'alvarado-molina v i.n.s.', 'guillen cedio v garland', 'villavicencio-castillo v i.n.s.', 'qorane v barr', 'ghotra v whitaker', 'majd v gonzales', 'maraziegos-morales v garland', 'morales v sessions', 'loredo rangel v garland', 'munoz-granados v barr', 'mejia-alvarenga v garland', 'eduard v ashcroft', 'gjetani v barr', 'dayo v holder', 'cabrera v sessions', 'evelyne v keisler', 'arif v mukasey', 'efe v ashcroft', 'argueta-hernandez v garland', 'abdel-masieh v ins', 'guevara flores v ins', 'tesfamichael v gonzales']","[]","[{'title': 'maraziegos-morales v garland', 'chunk': 'The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the petition for review in the case of Sonia Rangel and her two minor children, Luisa and Mary Loredo, versus Merrick Garland, U.S. Attorney General, regarding asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.'}, {'title': 'ontunez-tursios v ashcroft', 'chunk': ""The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals granted the petition for rehearing in the case of Argueta-Hernandez vs. Garland, vacating the BIA's decision and remanding for further proceedings.

"Can a U.S. federal district court compel the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to adjudicate an alien's 35-year-old application for lawful permanent resident status under the laws and facts as they existed at the time of the original filing, specifically to enable the alien to seek a deportation waiver that was subsequently repealed, given the alien's intervening criminal conviction and fraudulent conduct?","No, a U.S. federal district court cannot compel such adjudication under these circumstances. The court ruled against Armando Garcia on both his claims. For his Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) claim, the court granted summary judgment to USCIS, concluding that USCIS had adequately searched for a record of any adjudication of his 1981 application, albeit unsuccessfully. For his claim seeking reconsideration and adjudication of his 1981 lawful permanent resident (LPR) request under the facts and law as they stood in 1981, the court granted Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. The court determined that Garcia lacked standing because his theory of relief was too speculative and spectral, requiring extraordinary *nunc pro tunc* equitable remedies. The court doubted its authority to grant such extensive *nunc pro tunc* relief, which would entail ignoring subsequent criminal convictions and changes in immigration laws, and found it unwarranted on equitable grounds due to Garcia's fraudulent behavior and delays. The court found that any injury was not redressable because there was no guarantee of LPR status, and no guarantee of obtaining a discretionary § 212(c) waiver, which no longer exists.","[]","['ground saucer watch inc. v cia', 'ray v turner', 'francis v ins', 'oglesby v u.s. dept of the army', 'mil. audit project v casey', 'grand lodge of fraternal order of police v ashcroft', 'dept of air force v rose', 'u.s. dept of justice v tax analysts', 'truitt v dept of state', 'schuler v united states', 'rivera v i.n.s.', 'anderson v liberty lobby inc.', 'sparrow v united air lines inc.', 'u.s. ecology inc. v u.s. dept of interior', 'perry v block', 'santiago v holder', 'united states v yakou', 'juarez v u.s. dept of justice', 'safecard servs. inc. v sec', 'judicial watch inc. v kerry', 'zhang', 'trudeau v fed. trade commn', 'us immigration fund-ny llc v pekoske', 'neal v kelly', 'john doe agency v john doe corp.', 'daimlerchrysler corp. v cuno', 'arpaio v obama', 'garcia v us citizenship and immigration services', 'natl assn of home builders v norton', 'zamora-mallari v mukasey', 'scheuer v rhodes', 'u.s. dept of state v ray', 'bigwood v u.s. agency for intl dev.', 'schrecker v u.s. dept of justice', 'jerome stevens pharms. inc. v fda']","[]","[{'title': 'sakarapanee v dep’t of homeland sec., u.s. citizenship & immigration servs.', 'chunk': ""Turfah v.

"An individual, Mr. Rodriguez, is a long-time lawful permanent resident of the U.S. who has a final order of removal. After the initial 90-day statutory removal period, he is detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for an additional 10 months. During this prolonged detention, he alleges that federal immigration officials, knowing that his removal to his home country was not possible and that he was ineligible for removal to a third country, made false statements in official documents to justify his continued detention. Mr. Rodriguez seeks monetary damages against these federal officials under a *Bivens* action, claiming violations of his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights for unreasonable seizure and prolonged detention without due process. Can Mr. Rodriguez pursue a *Bivens* action for damages against the federal immigration officials under these circumstances?","No, Mr. Rodriguez cannot pursue a *Bivens* action for damages against the federal immigration officials for unconstitutionally prolonged detention under these circumstances, although federal courts do have subject matter jurisdiction to hear such a claim.

The court finds that claims challenging prolonged detention after the 90-day removal period, based on allegations that officials knew removal was impossible and prolonged detention for other reasons, do not ""arise from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders"" under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). Therefore, this specific type of claim is not barred by that jurisdictional statute.

However, the court holds that no *Bivens* remedy is available. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) is considered an ""elaborate remedial system"" that provides ""sufficient meaningful remedies"" for aliens, including numerous administrative review procedures and the availability of a writ of habeas corpus to challenge detention. Congress's frequent amendments to the INA without providing a damages remedy suggests a deliberate omission. The absence of monetary relief within this statutory scheme is not a sufficient reason to create a new *Bivens* remedy. Additionally, several ""special factors"" counsel against extending *Bivens* into this context: the breadth and detail of the INA itself, the importance of demonstrating due respect for the Constitution's separation of powers (Congress's power over naturalization and the Executive's role in foreign relations), and the doctrinal novelty and administrative difficulty of such a claim, which could lead to widespread litigation and potentially chill robust enforcement of immigration laws.","[]","['wilkie v robbins', 'united states v.', 'spencer v kemna', 'gupta v mcgahey', 'lincoln v vigil', 'garcia uranga v us citizenship & immigration services', 'alvarez v holder', 'zadvydas v davis', 'doe', 'de la paz v coy', 'davis v passman', 'heck v humphrey', 'ashcroft v iqbal', 'mirmehdi v united states', 'demore v kim', 'carlson v green', 'bivens v six unknown named agents of federal bureau of narcotics', 'arizona v united states', 'reno v flores', 'minneci v pollard', 'santiago alvarez v us immigration and customs enforcement', 'webster v doe']","[]","[{'title': 'aguilar-mendez', 'chunk': 'The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s request for voluntary departure.

While Congress expressed a ""sense"" that applications should be processed within 180 days, these timelines are ""precatory"" and ""non-binding."" A 29-month delay (including a 9-month lapse in the Regional Center Program's authorization) was not considered an ""unreasonable delay as a matter of law,"" especially given that courts often do not find delays between three to five years unreasonable. Granting relief would also unfairly place the petitioner ""at the head of the queue"" ahead of others who filed earlier, producing no net gain for the agency's competing priorities. Furthermore, alleged harms like investment risk and uncertainty about U.S. residency were deemed ""primarily personal and economic hardships"" not rising to the level of serious ""human health and welfare"" interests, and no bad faith by USCIS was established.","[]","['palakuru v renaud', 'arab v blinken', 'fangfang xu v cissna', 'skalka v kelly', 'natl assn of mfrs. v sec', 'zaman v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'yavari v pompeo', 'telles v mayorkas', 'thakker v renaud', 'mokkapati v mayorkas', 'mirror lake village llc v wolf', 'vietnam veterans of am. v shineseki', 'bell atl. corp. v twombly', 'mahmood v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'brzezinski v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'milligan v pompeo', 'punt v united states citizenship & immigration services', 'ctr. for sci. in the pub. int. v fda', 'dastagir v blinken', 'khamrabaeva v blinken', 'sarlak v pompeo', 'meyou v u.s. dept of state', 'ashcroft v iqbal', 'gona v u.s. citizenship & immigration servs.', 'mashpee wampanoag tribal council inc. v norton', 'bega v jaddou', 'desai v u.s. citizenship and immigr. servs.', 'didban v pompeo']","[]","[{'title': 'cameron v thornburgh', 'chunk': ""The court case PSV ENTERPRISES, LLC v.

"An undocumented immigrant, Mr. Garcia, received a Notice to Appear (NTA) from the Department of Homeland Security in 2020 that charged him with removability but did not specify the date or time of his initial hearing. Mr. Garcia applied for cancellation of removal, arguing that his U.S. citizen child, who suffers from a severe, rare medical condition requiring ongoing specialized treatment, would face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if he were removed. He also sought administrative closure while pursuing a U visa. The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied cancellation of removal, finding Mr. Garcia failed to establish the requisite hardship and good moral character, and did not rule on the motion for administrative closure. On appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), Mr. Garcia argued the NTA was deficient, depriving the agency of jurisdiction or, alternatively, constituting a claim-processing error. He also challenged the IJ's hardship finding and reiterated his request for administrative closure. After the BIA dismissed his appeal, his U visa application was denied, and he was subsequently removed. Can Mr. Garcia successfully challenge the BIA's decision regarding the NTA deficiency, the hardship finding for cancellation of removal, or the denial of administrative closure?","No, Mr. Garcia cannot successfully challenge the BIA's decision on these grounds.
1.  **NTA Deficiency:** The omission of time and place information from a Notice to Appear (NTA) does not deprive the Immigration Judge of subject-matter jurisdiction over removal proceedings. Furthermore, an objection to a noncompliant NTA is a claim-processing rule that is waived or forfeited if not timely raised by the closing of pleadings before the IJ.
2.  **Exceptional Hardship for Cancellation of Removal:** While the application of the ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" standard is a mixed question of law and fact reviewable by the court, the agency's underlying factual findings are unreviewable. Taking the agency's factual findings as conclusive (unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary), such as the availability of transportation for medical appointments, sufficient involvement by the other parent, and adequate financial support, the agency did not err in determining that Mr. Garcia's removal would not result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his qualifying relative. The agency's no-hardship finding is dispositive, making it unnecessary to reach any flaws in a moral-character analysis.
3.  **Administrative Closure:** Mr. Garcia's claim that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion for administrative closure or a continuance has been mooted by the denial of his U visa application and his subsequent removal from the United States, as it is impossible for the court to grant him any effectual relief.","[]","['sustaita-cordova v garland', 'niz-chavez v garland', 'garland v ming dai', 'wilkinson v garland', 'fuentes-pena v barr', 'castillo-gutierrez v garland', 'carreon v garland', 'ins v bagamasbad', 'mendoza-flores v rosen', 'rodriguez v garland', 'pereira v sessions', 'meza morales v barr', 'guerrero-lasprilla v barr', 'maniar v garland', 'hernandez-castillo v sessions', 'hernandez v garland 6th cir.', 'saenz v garland', 'nkenglefac v garland', 'meridor v u.s. atty gen.', 'patel v garland', 'campos v united states', 'jimenez-rodriguez v garland']","[]","[{'title': 'tobar v garland', 'chunk': 'That said, noncitizens may leave the country without disturbing their continuous physical presence if their absences from the United States are “brief, casual, and innocent.” 8 U.S.C. § 1254a(c)(4).

Spagnol-Bastos argues that the BIA abused its discretion by concluding that he forfeited his right to notice of the court hearing because he failed to correct an address error unknown to him and by failing to adequately consider his affidavit testimony. Neither argument is persuasive. 1 An alien subject to removal proceedings is generally entitled to a written notice that, among other things, specifies the time and place of the removal proceedings and the consequences for failing to appear for those proceedings. 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1).

"Under what circumstances can a U.S. federal court compel U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to expedite the adjudication of an I-526 immigrant investor visa petition that has been pending for over four years, where the plaintiff alleges unreasonable delay under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Mandamus Act?","A U.S. federal court would not compel USCIS to expedite an I-526 immigrant investor visa petition that has been pending for over four years if the plaintiff fails to plausibly allege unreasonable delay under the ""TRAC"" factors. In this case, the court found that USCIS's processing system, which includes a ""visa availability approach"" prioritizing applicants from countries with available or soon-to-be-available visas, and a modified ""first-in, first-out"" methodology within queues for specific commercial enterprises, adheres to an ""identifiable rationale"" (TRAC factor 1). Although Congress has expressed a ""sense of Congress"" that applications should be completed within 180 days, this is aspirational and not a binding timeline (TRAC factor 2). The court also considered the approximate 4.3-year delay in light of significant external factors, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic and a nine-month lapse in statutory authorization for the EB-5 program. The plaintiff's alleged harms, described as ""health and human prejudices,"" financial harm, and the inability to acquire lawful permanent residency, were deemed primarily economic and inherent in the immigration process, thus insufficient to weigh TRAC factors 3 and 5 in his favor, especially in the absence of severe health concerns or family separation. Furthermore, compelling USCIS to expedite the plaintiff's petition would simply move him ahead of other similarly situated applicants, interfering with agency priorities and producing no net gain (TRAC factor 4).

"A non-citizen defendant, undocumented since age seven, pleads guilty to reduced drug charges in 2010, receiving a suspended sentence. In 2017, he faces deportation. His immigration attorneys inform him that his conviction makes him ineligible for cancellation of removal and permanently inadmissible to the U.S., which he alleges his trial counsel failed to clearly explain. His Motion for Appropriate Relief (MAR) for ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC) under *Padilla v. Kentucky*, and for his plea not being knowingly and voluntarily entered, is initially denied.

On appeal, what is the likely ruling and reasoning of the appellate court regarding the trial court's order?","The appellate court would likely vacate the trial court's order in part and remand the case for further proceedings.

The appellate court would find that the trial court failed to make sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law on critical issues. Specifically, the trial court did not address the defendant's claims regarding the loss of eligibility for discretionary cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1) and permanent inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). For cancellation of removal, the trial court failed to make findings on the defendant's physical presence, good moral character, other convictions, or the hardship his removal would cause to his U.S. citizen child, which are all prerequisites for determining the statute's potential availability to the defendant. For both cancellation of removal and inadmissibility, the trial court did not properly evaluate prejudice by determining whether the defendant demonstrated a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial, including evaluating the credibility of his affidavit on this point.

Additionally, the appellate court would rule that the trial court erred by failing to comply with its prior order, which explicitly directed the trial court to resolve ""whether [Defendant’s plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered."" This issue was not addressed at all in the trial court's subsequent order.

The appellate court would, however, agree with the trial court that the specific deportability provision under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (deportation for conviction *after admission*) did not apply, as the defendant was never ""admitted"" to the U.S. Therefore, there could be no deficient performance or prejudice related to counsel's advice regarding that particular statute.

"An immigration advocacy organization and several detained aliens challenge the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) policies regarding in-person hearings and access to counsel, implemented in response to a public health emergency. They seek a temporary restraining order (TRO) arguing these policies violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and the Fifth Amendment right to procedural due process. Will a U.S. federal court likely grant their motion for a TRO?","No, a U.S. federal court will likely deny the motion for a TRO. The plaintiffs failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits, primarily because they did not demonstrate standing, as the individual plaintiffs did not have imminent in-person hearings, and the organizational plaintiffs could not show that judges regularly denied requests for remote appearances or continuances. Moreover, the Immigration and Nationality Act's jurisdiction-channeling provisions likely foreclose access-to-counsel and due process claims, directing such challenges to federal courts of appeals, not district courts. Regarding the APA claims, the court found the challenged policies were not ""final agency action"" because legal consequences flow from individual immigration judge decisions rather than the general policies themselves. The court also determined there was no ""failure-to-act"" claim as plaintiffs could not point to a specific statutory obligation requiring the defendants to take the requested actions, and the defendants' policies were not arbitrary and capricious given the rapidly evolving public health crisis. Furthermore, the plaintiffs did not establish they would suffer imminent irreparable injury, and the balance of equities and public interest did not favor imposing a broad, one-size-fits-all injunctive relief on the government's efforts to manage the immigration system while responding to the pandemic.","[]","['national immigration project of the national lawyers guild v executive office of immigration review', 'winter v nat. res. def. council inc.', 'j.e.f.m. v lynch', 'clark v clark', 'davis v pension benefit guar. corp.', 'o.a. v trump', 'sierra club v epa', 'pursuing am.s greatness v fec', 'cityfed fin. corp. v office of thrift supervision', 'bennett v spear', 'lujan v defs. of wildlife', 'arpaio v obama', 'cobell v norton', 'jennings v rodriguez', 'aguilar v u.s. immigration & customs enft div. of dept of homeland sec.', 'steel co. v citizens for a better envt', 'p.l. v u.s. immigration & customs enft', 'norton v s. utah wilderness all.', 'spokeo inc. v robbins']","[]","[{'title': 'garcia ramirez v us immigration and custom enforcement', 'chunk': '36) is DENIED,  and Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (ECF No. 6) is GRANTED.

The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) denied the petition, asserting that the invested cash loan proceeds constituted ""indebtedness"" under 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e) and required collateralization by personal assets, which the investor failed to demonstrate.

The court found that USCIS's interpretation of 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e)—that third-party loan proceeds invested as cash are properly characterized as ""indebtedness"" requiring personal collateralization—is plainly erroneous. The regulation unambiguously defines ""capital"" to include ""cash,"" and the ordinary meaning of ""cash"" encompasses cash loan proceeds. The court clarified that the regulation directs the agency to identify the asset *actually contributed* to the enterprise, which in this scenario is cash. The collateralization requirement for ""indebtedness"" only applies when the investor contributes a promise to pay (indebtedness to the enterprise itself), not when the enterprise receives readily deployable cash. Furthermore, USCIS's interpretation effectively amends the regulation by adding a new requirement for cash investments without proper notice and comment, thus violating the Administrative Procedure Act. Therefore, USCIS's denial of such petitions is arbitrary and capricious, and the denials should be vacated and remanded for reconsideration consistent with this understanding.","[]","['auer v robbins', 'united states v.', 'motor vehicle mfrs. assn of u.s. inc. v state farm mut. auto. ins.', 'christensen v harris county', 'thomas jefferson univ. v shalala', 'zhang v united states citizenship and immigration services']","[]","[{'title': 'anderson v liberty lobby, inc.', 'chunk': ""This case summary involves DLS Precision Fab LLC, which was found liable for violations of 8 U.S.C. § 1324a.

The AAO was within its discretion to demand evidence tracing the funds from the applicant's bank account to the wiring entities, even if the applicant faced difficulties due to banking restrictions and third-party non-cooperation. The applicant's unsupported affidavit regarding the movement of funds through an unidentified person is insufficient to meet the burden of proof, as the agency relies on the absence of corroborating evidence. Furthermore, the AAO, exercising de novo review, was permitted to identify and base its denial on the currency discrepancy in the gold coin invoice, even if it was not raised in the initial denial, because the inconsistency was present in a document submitted by the applicant herself and did not require the agency to provide an opportunity to rebut derogatory information unknown to the applicant. The court cannot reweigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the agency on factual findings.

"A foreign investor seeks an EB-5 visa through a regional center, proposing to invest $500,000 in a new commercial enterprise (NCE) that will loan funds to multiple job-creating entities (JCEs) for various mining projects in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA). At the time of filing the Form I-526 petition, the investor's business plan and offering memorandum list four potential mining locations, but explicitly state that not all have been formally approved, and alternative or additional projects are unspecified and unapproved if initial projects fall through or require less funding. The plan includes an economic report projecting job creation based on mining expenditures but without specific JCE locations. USCIS denies the petition, citing failure to establish TEA qualification and job creation at the time of filing, and views subsequent clarification of JCE locations as an impermissible material change. Can the investor successfully challenge this denial, arguing that the NCE was clearly intended to operate in a TEA and that their economic report adequately demonstrated job creation potential, irrespective of specific JCE locations at filing?","No, the investor cannot successfully challenge the denial. A U.S. District Court has upheld USCIS's denial of similar EB-5 visa petitions on two independent grounds: (1) failure to establish that the Job Creating Entities (JCEs) were principally doing business in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA) at the time of filing, and (2) failure to establish that the investments would create full-time positions for at least ten qualifying employees at the time of filing. For regional center investments, the ""principally doing business"" requirement applies to the JCEs, not the New Commercial Enterprise (NCE). The Court found it reasonable for USCIS to conclude that the investor failed to meet the TEA requirement because the JCEs were not fully identified or approved at the time of filing, making it impossible to determine if the $500,000 TEA investment threshold was met. Furthermore, changes to JCE locations after filing were deemed impermissible material changes affecting eligibility. Regarding job creation, the Court found that the initial business plan, lacking specified JCE locations, was not sufficiently comprehensive to support a credible economic analysis for prospective job creation at the time of filing. USCIS could not assess the reasonableness of assumptions about the geographic impact of projects without this information. Subsequent economic reports based on later-identified JCEs were also rejected due to the material change doctrine, which requires eligibility to be established at the time of filing.","[]","['wang v uscis', 'united states v.', 'fcc v fox television stations inc.', 'motor vehicle mfrs. assn of u.s. inc. v state farm mut. auto. ins.', 'fogo de chao holdings inc. v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'ctr. for food safety v salazar', 'dist. hosp. partners l.p. v burwell', 'indiana municipal power agency v ferc', 'am. bioscience inc. v thompson', 'assoc. of data processing serv. orgs. inc. v bd. of govs. of fed. reserve sys.', 'sussex engineering ltd. v montgomery', 'yang v holder', 'kungys v united states', 'citizens to preserve overton park inc. v volpe', 'southeast conference v vilsack']","[]","[{'title': 'w-e-r-b', 'chunk': 'Matter of Negusie, 27 I&N Dec. 481 (A.G. 2018); see also Matter of E-L-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 700, 702 (A.G. 2004) (stating that “if a Board decision has been certified to the Attorney General, it is neither final nor effective during the pendency of the Attorney General’s review”).

Additionally, the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate sufficient hardship, as their fears of adverse agency action were too remote, particularly given that the EB-5 Regional Center Program lacked statutory authorization at the time and the regulatory regime was unclear on terminating regional centers based on geographic redeployment.","[]","['conley v gibson', 'papasan v allain', 'her majesty the queen in right of ontario v epa', 'settles v u.s. parole commn', 'truckers united for safety v fed. highway admin.', 'valero energy corp. v epa', 'civitas mass. regional ctr. v mayorkas', 'herbert v natl acad. of scis.', 'bell atl. corp. v twombly', 'koutny v martin', 'kokkonen v guardian life ins. co. of am.', 'texas v united states', 'friends of animals v u.s. bureau of land mgmt.', 'am. petrol. inst. v epa', 'coal. for underground expansion v mineta', 'trudeau v fed. trade commn', 'abbott labs v gardner', 'us immigration fund-ny llc v pekoske', 'ashcroft v iqbal', 'daimlerchrysler corp. v cuno', 'mcbryde v comm. to review', 'bagherian v pompeo', 'arizonans for official english v arizona', 'ciba-geigy corp. v epa', 'bromfman v uscis', 'natl park hospitality assn v dept of interior', 'grand lodge of fraternal order of police v ashcroft']","[]","[{'title': 'cameron v thornburgh', 'chunk': ""The court case PSV ENTERPRISES, LLC v.

"Nikunj Devani, a citizen of India, filed an EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program petition (Form I-526) in October 2019, which USCIS has yet to process. He alleges unreasonable delay, seeking to compel USCIS to adjudicate his petition, despite USCIS's visa availability approach and a 9-month lapse in the Regional Center Program's authorization. Will the court compel USCIS to expedite processing of his I-526 petition, considering the TRAC factors for unreasonable delay?","No, the court will dismiss Devani's action, denying his request to compel USCIS to process his I-526 petition. The court found that Devani failed to state a plausible claim of unreasonable delay under the TRAC factors.
1.  **Rule of Reason & Congressional Timetable:** USCIS's visa availability approach, which processes petitions on a modified ""first-in, first-out"" basis prioritizing petitioners from countries below visa caps, constitutes a rule of reason. Congress has not mandated a binding timeline for I-526 processing; the ""sense of Congress"" resolution is merely hortatory. The effective 32-month delay (accounting for a 9-month lapse in statutory authority) is not unreasonable, especially compared to the current average 52-month processing time for Indian applicants.
2.  **Prejudice to Health, Welfare, and Other Interests:** Devani's alleged financial and immigration-related harms (uncertainty) are considered inherent risks of the I-526 application process and do not rise to the level of harm, such as significant threats to physical health or safety, typically warranting intervention under these factors.
3.  **Agency's Competing Priorities:** Granting relief would require USCIS to reorder its priorities, placing Devani ahead of other similarly situated petitioners in the existing backlog, which the court is hesitant to do.
4.  **Impropriety:** Devani did not plausibly allege any facts of impropriety by USCIS. The 9-month pause in processing was due to a lapse in statutory authorization, not agency misconduct.","[]","['palakuru v renaud', 'emergency coal. to defend educ. travel v dept of treasury', 'arab v blinken', 'cannon v district of columbia', 'skalka v kelly', 'vafaei v united states citizenship & immigration services uscis', 'telles v mayorkas', 'thakker v renaud', 'bell atl. corp. v twombly', 'sanchez-mercedes v bureau of prisons', 'milligan v pompeo', 'ctr. for sci. in the pub. int. v fda', 'sarlak v pompeo', 'ashcroft v iqbal', 'devani v united states citizenship & immigration services uscis', 'addala v renaud', 'da costa v immigr. inv. program off.', 'bagherian v pompeo', 'telecommunications research & action center v fcc', 'behring regl ctr. llc v mayorkas', 'mashpee wampanoag tribal council inc. v norton', 'bega v jaddou', 'bromfman v uscis', 'didban v pompeo', 'hettinga v united states']","[]","[{'title': 'tatintsyan v barr', 'chunk': 'The provided document cites Tatintsyan v.

"A U.S. citizen sponsoring an immigrant spouse through a USCIS Form I-864 Affidavit of Support has separated from the spouse. The immigrant spouse seeks damages for breach of the Affidavit of Support, repayment of a personal loan, and attorney's fees. What are the legal obligations of the sponsor regarding the Affidavit of Support, including the relevant household size and income calculations, and what remedies are available for the loan and fees?","The trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the Affidavit of Support claims for all relevant years, as the plaintiff's prayer for relief covered all damages. However, the trial court erred by calculating damages using the 125% Federal Poverty Level (FPL) Guidelines for a two-person household; it should have used the guidelines for a one-person household, as the child was a U.S. citizen and not a sponsored alien. The trial court did not err by calculating the sponsored immigrant's income using Adjusted Gross Income, allowing for the deduction of depreciation expenses.

Regarding the personal loan, the defendant's argument that an implied-in-fact contract existed (instead of a quasi-contract) was waived because it contradicted their position at trial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not crediting the defendant for ""sweat equity"" on other properties when fashioning the equitable remedy for the loan used to purchase the income-producing property. The trial court did err by awarding repayment of the loan in U.S. Dollars (USD) instead of Australian Dollars (AUD); the award must be converted to AUD on remand.

The trial court's decision to hold an additional conference before the final order was entered, and any missing portions of the trial transcript, did not constitute reversible error because the defendant failed to show prejudice. Finally, the trial court did not err by awarding reasonable attorney's fees to the immigrant spouse for prevailing on her Affidavit of Support claims, though the amount may be reconsidered on remand due to the reduction in damages owed.","[]","['anderson v anderson', 'younis v farooqi', 'tohato inc. v pinewild mgmt.', 'erler v erler erler i', 'mckoy v mckoy', 'villars v villars', 'erler v erler erler ii', 'state v sharpe', 'wenfang liu v mund', 'barnett v barnett', 'suozzo v suozzo', 'zhu v deng', 'flores v flores', 'pelc v pham', 'martin v n.c. dept. of health & human servs.', 'n.c. ins. guar. assn v weathersfield mgmt.', 'weil v herring', 'bartlett milling co. v walnut grove auction & realty', 'kinlaw v harris']","[]","[{'title': 'witter v ins', 'chunk': 'The provided document is from a United States Court of Appeals case, No. 23-60100, filed on December 18, 2024.

"Under what circumstances, as per the District Court's ruling, can a coalition challenge specific immigration policy changes for lack of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and what types of challenges are generally dismissed?","A coalition can challenge specific immigration policy changes for lack of NEPA review under the APA if at least one plaintiff has constitutional standing and the claims fall within NEPA's zone of interests. For standing, a plaintiff must show a concrete procedural injury under NEPA, impairment of concrete environmental interests (e.g., direct harm to land, disruption of enjoyment), causation (a demonstrable increase in risk to particularized interests due to non-compliance), and redressability (the court ordering the agency to undertake the procedure could mitigate harm). The alleged injuries must have a sufficiently close connection to the physical environment.

However, challenges are dismissed if they are:
1.  **To an agency's NEPA instruction manual:** Such a manual is not considered ""final agency action"" under the APA if it is not the consummation of the agency’s decision-making process and does not create new legal obligations or impose legal consequences.
2.  **A broad ""programmatic"" challenge:** The APA limits review to ""discrete"" agency actions, precluding broad programmatic attacks that lump together numerous diffuse policy changes without identifying a single order, regulation, or completed universe of orders and regulations.
3.  **Barred by specific statutory schemes:** While challenges to generally applicable rules or policies regarding immigration (like administrative closure or rescission of certain ""Remain in Mexico"" policies) are reviewable, challenges to individual orders of removal or actions committed to agency discretion by law are generally not. The court specifically noted that INA provisions channeling review of removal orders to circuit courts do not bar challenges to the lack of NEPA analysis for general policy changes.

Specific immigration policy changes that survived dismissal in this case for potential NEPA review include:
*   Ending construction of the southern border wall.
*   Terminating ""Remain in Mexico"" policies (Migrant Protection Protocols, Asylum Cooperative Agreements, Prompt Asylum Claim Review, Humanitarian Asylum Review Process).
*   Allowing border patrol agents to grant permission for aliens to stay and helping them board buses.
*   Preventing immigration officials from detaining and removing aliens (challenging the general policy, not individual decisions).
*   Ending the practice of fining aliens for failing to leave the country (challenging the general policy).
*   Reinstating administrative closure in immigration courts.
*   Expanding various refugee programs (challenging the Department of State's actions to resettle refugees, specifically its requests for proposals and awards to grantees, rather than the Presidential refugee admission ceiling).","[]","['city of dania beach fla. v faa', 'city of los angeles v lyons', 'arizona v biden', 'biden v texas', 'lincoln v vigil', 'robertson v methow valley citizens council', 'zukerman v usps', 'las ams. immigrant advoc. ctr. v wolf', 'j.e.f.m. v lynch', 'catawaba cnty. v epa', 'am. fedn of govt. emps. afl-cio v trump', 'block v cmty. nutrition inst.', 'heckler v chaney', 'competitive enter. inst. v natl highway traffic safety admin.', 'bell atl. corp. v twombly', 'texas v united states', 'cal. cattlemens assn v u.s. fish & wildlife serv.', 'fla. audubon socy v bentsen', 'cal. cmtys. against toxics v epa', 'lexmark intl inc. v static control components inc.', 'sugar cane growers coop. of fla. v veneman', 'sierra club v epa', 'o.a. v trump', 'metro. edison co. v people against nuclear energy', 'united transp. union v icc', 'texas v biden', 'fund for animals inc. v u.s. bureau of land mgmt.', 'whitman v am. trucking assns', 'banneker ventures llc v graham', 'summers v earth island inst.', 'bennett v spear', 'holistic candlers & consumers assn v fda', 'natl min. assn v mccarthy', 'lujan v natl wildlife fedn', 'cement kiln recycling corp. v epa', 'gunpowder riverkeeper v ferc', 'ashcroft v iqbal', 'lujan v defs. of wildlife', 'center for biological diversity v trump', 'arpaio v obama', 'i.n.s. v st. cyr', 'jennings v rodriguez', 'natl assn of home builders v norton', 'united states v texas', 'natl audubon socy inc. v watt', 'soundboard assn v ftc', 'scenic am. inc. v u.s. dept of transp.', 'arizona v mayorkas', 'mountain states legal found. v glickman', 'massachusetts coalition for immigration reform v us citizenship and immigration services', 'norton v s. utah wilderness all.', 'darby v cisneros', 'osborn v visa inc.', 'spokeo inc. v robbins', 'sierra club v jackson']","[]","[{'title': 'county of sacramento v lewis', 'chunk': 'The County of Sacramento v.

"A noncitizen defendant seeks to withdraw a guilty plea, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to advise him of the adverse immigration consequences, specifically that relief under INA Section 212(c) was unavailable.

The defendant had strong ties to the U.S. and faced severe charges, but also had potential grounds for dismissal or acquittal. Under these circumstances, would the defendant's motion to withdraw the guilty plea due to ineffective assistance of counsel likely be granted based on a showing of prejudice?","No, the defendant's motion to withdraw the guilty plea would likely not be granted. To establish prejudice for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the plea context, the defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. In this situation, the defendant's affidavit alone is insufficient without contemporaneous evidence to substantiate that avoiding deportation was the determinative issue. The record lacks evidence of the defendant's motivations beyond the affidavit, especially since counsel invoked attorney-client privilege. Furthermore, despite receiving advice that relief under Section 212(c) was discretionary and not assured, the defendant still pleaded guilty to a deportable offense. The trial court also provided a statutory advisement about potential deportation consequences, and there is no indication the defendant misunderstood it. Finally, the defendant faced significantly harsher consequences (18 felony counts, including first-degree rape, with potential life sentences and firearm specifications) by going to trial compared to the plea agreement (sexual battery and attempted abduction with suspended sentences and probation), making the decision to plead guilty appear rational.

"An individual, a native of Tanzania, entered the U.S. on a student visa and subsequently married a U.S. citizen. This marriage was later annulled, but before the annulment, the U.S. citizen spouse filed an I-130 petition on the individual's behalf, which was later denied due to the U.S. citizen spouse's fraudulent multiple marriages. The individual then married a second U.S. citizen, claiming battery and extreme cruelty, and filed an I-360 self-petition. The USCIS and AAO denied this I-360 petition, citing the previous marriage as fraudulent under Section 204(c) and also finding a failure to prove good faith in the second marriage. The individual appeals, arguing that the annulment means the first marriage never existed and that the previous I-130 denial should not apply to the current I-360 petition. Is the agency's decision to deny the I-360 petition, based on the prior fraudulent marriage and lack of good faith in the second marriage, arbitrary or capricious?","No, the agency's decision to deny the I-360 petition was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The court found that there was more than enough evidence to support the conclusion that the plaintiff and his first U.S. citizen spouse did not marry in good faith, given the spouse's conviction for marriage fraud involving five marriages. The fact that the plaintiff obtained an annulment did not establish his intent at the time of the marriage. Therefore, the I-360 petition was properly denied because the plaintiff had previously sought immediate relative status based on a marriage determined to be for the purpose of evading immigration laws, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c). Additionally, the court found an independent basis for denial: the plaintiff failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he entered into his second marriage in good faith, as required for the I-360 petition, having provided limited probative details beyond the abuse he sustained.","[]","['united states v.', 'camp v pitts', 'motor vehicle mfrs. assn of u.s. inc. v state farm mut. auto. ins.', 'basil v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'citizens to preserve overton park inc. v volpe']","[]","[{'title': 'mckenzie v us citizenship & immigration services', 'chunk': '50475, 50496 (Oct. 7, 1991).

"In an Administrative Procedure Act (APA) challenge to the denial of an I-129 immigration petition by USCIS, where the plaintiffs reside in Washington and the petition was adjudicated by a USCIS service center in California, can the case initially filed in the District of Columbia be transferred to another district, and what factors guide such a transfer decision?","Yes, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia can transfer such a case to another district, specifically to the Central District of California, based on the court's authority under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) for the ""convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice.""

The court's decision is guided by a two-fold inquiry:
1.  **Could the case have been brought in the transferee district?** Yes, both the Central District of California (where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred, as the USCIS California Service Center adjudicated the petition) and the Western District of Washington (where the plaintiffs reside) are proper venues under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).
2.  **Do private and public interests favor transfer?** The court found that these interests largely weigh in favor of transfer to the Central District of California.
    *   **Preferred forum:** While plaintiffs preferred D.C., the deference to their choice was lessened because D.C. is not their home forum and lacks meaningful ties to the controversy. The USCIS headquarters had relocated from D.C., and the remaining D.C. offices were not involved in the petition's adjudication.
    *   **Location where the claim arose:** The claim arose in the Central District of California, where the challenged federal action (the petition denial) occurred, supporting the local interest in deciding controversies at home.
    *   **Convenience:** The Central District of California is the more convenient forum as the field office most familiar with the facts of the application is located there, and any relief granted would apply to officials in that district.
    *   **Relative congestion of the courts and familiarity with governing law:** These factors were considered neutral, as statistics on congestion were mixed, and all federal judges are presumed familiar with federal laws, including immigration disputes and the APA.

Consequently, the court granted the motion to transfer the case to the Central District of California and did not address the defendant's motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction or improper venue.","[]","['pasem v uscis', 'wolfram alpha llc v cuccinelli', 'ike v uscis', 'gyau v sessions', 'producers of renewables united for integrity truth & transparency v epa', 'bahena v renaud', 'onaghise v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'al-ahmed v chertoff', 'aracely v nielsen', 'efficientip inc. v cuccinelli no.', 'adams v bell', 'ruhrgas ag v marathon oil co.', 'islamic republic of iran v boeing co.', 'mohammadi v scharfen', 'pac. mar. assn v nlrb', 'natl assn of home builders v epa', 'ngonga v sessions', 'abusadeh v chertoff no.', 'w. watersheds project v pool', 'chauhan v napolitano', 'one on one basketball inc. v glob. payments direct inc.', 'bourdon v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'aftab v gonzalez', 'norton v s. utah wilderness all.', 'van dusen v barrack', 'wei lai development llc v united states citizenship and immigration services']","[]","[{'title': 'ngonga v sessions', 'chunk': ""The court transferred the Wei Lai Development LLC, et al. v.

"If an individual receives a Notice to Appear (NTA) for removal proceedings that does not initially specify the time and place of the hearing, and they subsequently apply for cancellation of removal based on hardship to their children, can they challenge the validity of the NTA in federal court and appeal the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) finding that their children would not face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship?","No, an individual in this situation would likely not succeed in challenging the NTA's validity or appealing the hardship determination.
Regarding the NTA, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that an NTA which does not list the time and place of the initial hearing is not defective as a valid charging document, because regulations (8 C.F.R. § 1003.18(b)), not the statute (8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)), govern what an NTA must contain, and subsequent notices can cure any deficiency by providing the required information. The court found this argument foreclosed by its own binding circuit precedent.
Regarding the hardship determination, the court explicitly stated it lacked jurisdiction to review the BIA's finding that removal would not cause exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the individual's children. This jurisdictional bar is imposed by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) and was clarified by the Supreme Court in *Patel v.

"In a child custody dispute where one parent has been deported due to alleged domestic violence, can a U.S. federal court order the children to travel abroad to visit the deported parent, even if the other parent fears for her safety and that of the children if they were to leave the U.S.?","Yes, a U.S. federal court can order children to travel abroad for visitation with a deported parent if the trial court finds that the deported parent is not an unfit caregiver and that in-person contact is in the children's best interest. Such an order is permissible, particularly when the deported parent's inability to enter the United States makes international travel the only reasonable option for visitation. The court must consider all relevant factors, including acts of domestic violence between the parties, the safety of the child, and the safety of either party.

"Can a U.S. lawful permanent resident successfully sue the U.S. State Department for unreasonable delay in processing an immigrant visa for their spouse under the Administrative Procedure Act, or for violating their Fifth Amendment due process rights, given a processing delay of under two years exacerbated by a global pandemic?","No, a U.S. lawful permanent resident cannot successfully sue the U.S. State Department for unreasonable delay or Fifth Amendment due process violations under these circumstances.

The Court dismissed the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claim for unreasonable delay because:
1.  The State Department's practice of processing visa applications on a first-in, first-out basis is considered a ""rule of reason"" for decision-making, and Congress has not established a specific statutory timetable for visa processing.
2.  A delay of approximately fourteen months (less than two years) is not deemed unreasonable as a matter of law, especially given the extraordinary backlog of cases (increasing from approximately 75,000 to 473,000) and the disruption to services caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.
3.  Granting relief would place the plaintiff ahead of other similarly situated applicants, interfering with the State Department's allocation of resources and its prioritization of ""mission critical"" functions during the pandemic.
4.  The plaintiff's broad allegations regarding the delay's toll on his physical and mental health and the harm to his family were insufficient to meet the criteria for human health and welfare or other interests prejudiced by the delay.
5.  No impropriety or bad faith on the part of the agency was alleged.
Consequently, the mandamus action based on the APA claim also failed.

The Court dismissed the Fifth Amendment due process claims (both substantive and procedural) because:
1.  There is no fundamental liberty interest in having a spouse's visa application granted or processed more quickly, as admission of aliens to the United States is a privilege granted by the sovereign, not a right. The Supreme Court precedent, such as *Kerry v. Din*, explicitly forecloses such a substantive due process argument.
2.  Since there is no protected liberty or property interest at stake in an immigrant visa and a process governed by a rule of reason exists for applicants, there can be no procedural due process violation.
The plaintiff's equal protection claim, also a Fifth Amendment claim, was dismissed as a matter of law for similar reasons.

Claims against the DHS defendants were dismissed as moot because the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) had already approved the I-130 petition and transferred it to the National Visa Center, completing its role in the process. Additionally, claims concerning the Controlled Application Review and Resolution Program (CARRP) were dismissed as moot against DHS and constitutionally unripe against the State Department, as CARRP is a DHS policy.","[]","['palakuru v renaud', 'washington v glucksberg', 'abhe & svoboda inc. v chao', 'united states v.', 'papasan v allain', 'fangfang xu v cissna', 'kerry v din', 'settles v u.s. parole commn', 'nohria v renaud', 'obergefell v hodges', 'skalka v kelly', 'nibber v u.s. citizenship & immigr. servs.', 'yavari v pompeo', 'smirnov v clinton', 'thakker v renaud', 'herbert v natl acad. of scis.', 'bell atl. corp. v twombly', 'natl postal profl nurses v u.s. postal serv.', 'koutny v martin', 'colindres v u.s. dept of state', 'xiaobing liu v blinken', 'moore v city of e. cleveland', 'muvvala v wolf', 'gustaveschmidt v chao', 'coal. for underground expansion v mineta', 'trudeau v fed. trade commn', 'ren v mueller', 'kangarloo v pompeo', 'us immigration fund-ny llc v pekoske', 'jafarzadeh v duke', 'ashcroft v iqbal', 'ward v d.c. dept of youth rehab. servs.', 'jingjing v mayorkas', 'bagherian v pompeo', 'telecommunications research & action center v fcc', 'hinton v corr. corp. of am.', 'tate v pompeo', 'manzoor v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'mashpee wampanoag tribal council inc. v norton', 'willson v commr', 'mathews v eldridge', 'grand lodge of fraternal order of police v ashcroft']","[]","[{'title': 'cameron v thornburgh', 'chunk': ""The court case PSV ENTERPRISES, LLC v.

"An EB-5 investor, John, filed a Form I-526 petition based on an investment in a limited partnership that included a ""Call Option"" allowing the general partner to repurchase John's interest for a fixed amount if the business was successful.

Concurrently, other investors in the same partnership, who submitted functionally identical petitions, received different denial notices from USCIS, citing various other reasons or fewer reasons for denial, with no explanation for the varied treatment. If John challenges USCIS's decision under the Administrative Procedure Act, what is the likely outcome regarding the ""at risk"" determination and the disparate treatment of petitions?","The court would likely find that USCIS's reasoning in denying John's petition on the grounds that the Call Option made his capital not ""at risk"" and constituted a ""guaranteed return"" was arbitrary and capricious, as the Call Option did not guarantee the return of capital regardless of the business's success or failure, nor did it provide the investor with any rights to exercise it. Additionally, the court would likely find that USCIS acted arbitrarily and capriciously by issuing different denial notices with varying reasons to functionally equivalent petitions without providing any explanation for the disparate treatment. The appropriate remedy would be to remand John's petition to USCIS for reconsideration consistent with the court's opinion, requiring USCIS to either treat all similar petitions in the same manner or sufficiently explain any reasons for treating them differently.

"Under North Carolina law, can a trial court order a custodial parent to send children to a foreign country for visitation with a non-custodial parent who has been deported, particularly when there is a history of domestic violence against the custodial parent and concerns about the children's immigration status?","Yes, a North Carolina trial court can order children to travel to a foreign country for visitation with a non-custodial parent who has been deported, even with a history of domestic violence against the custodial parent and immigration concerns. A court cannot deny a parent reasonable visitation unless it makes a written finding that the parent is unfit or that visitation is not in the best interest of the child. If the court finds the deported parent is not unfit and visitation is in the children's best interest, and the parent is unable to enter the United States, then visitation in the foreign country may be deemed the only reasonable visitation available. The trial court must consider all relevant factors, including acts of domestic violence, the safety of the child, and the safety of either party from domestic violence, and support its determination with written findings of fact.

Factors weighing against a finding of prejudice include: (1) Strong evidence of guilt presented by the State (video, witnesses); (2) The defendant's stated primary goal at the time of the plea was to receive probation, not to avoid deportation; (3) The defendant was aware of an ICE detainer prior to entering his plea, making his assertion of unawareness of deportation consequences not credible; (4) The defendant's limited ties to the United States and strong ties to his country of origin (unemployed, did not reside with his U.S. citizen wife, child in Haiti, only intended a brief vacation); (5) The trial court properly advised the defendant, pursuant to R.C. 2943.031(A), that his conviction could result in deportation, exclusion, or denial of naturalization, and the defendant acknowledged understanding this advisement without asking questions; (6) The defendant acknowledged reviewing and understanding the plea form, which stated his understanding of consequences for non-U.S. citizens; and (7) An unreasonable delay of four years in filing the motion to withdraw the plea.

The sponsor only promised to support the alien spouse in the Affidavit of Support, and the U.S. citizen child was not listed on the form as an immigrant intended to be sponsored, as the Affidavit of Support does not apply to U.S. citizens. Therefore, the court should calculate the damages using the FPL Guidelines for a one-person household. For example, for 2016, if the one-person FPL Guideline was $14,850 and the spouse's adjusted gross income was $8,511, the damages would be $6,339. The court did not err by deducting depreciation expenses from the spouse's adjusted gross income when calculating damages.

Regarding the loan, as the spouse loaned and paid the sponsor in Australian Dollars (AUD), the interest was repaid in AUD, and the spouse's loss occurred in AUD, the court erred by awarding equitable relief payable in U.S. Dollars (USD). On remand, the trial court must correct and convert the spouse's equitable award and any interest thereon to be repayable in AUD for any outstanding balance. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not crediting the sponsor with any purported ""sweat equity"" for repairing other properties. The trial court's award of reasonable attorney's fees to the spouse for claims of breach of the Affidavit of Support is affirmed, but the amount may be reconsidered upon remand.","[]","['buncombe county ex rel andres v newburn', 'anderson v anderson', 'gay v walter', 'younis v farooqi', 'madar v madar', 'tohato inc. v pinewild mgmt.', 'erler v erler erler i', 'mckoy v mckoy', 'villars v villars', 'erler v erler erler ii', 'state v sharpe', 'iannuzzelli v lovett', 'wenfang liu v mund', 'barnett v barnett', 'suozzo v suozzo', 'zhu v deng', 'flores v flores', 'pelc v pham', 'martin v n.c. dept. of health & human servs.', 'n.c. ins. guar. assn v weathersfield mgmt.', 'weil v herring', 'bartlett milling co. v walnut grove auction & realty', 'state v quick', 'kinlaw v harris', 'm.v. eleftherotria v owner of m.v. despina r']","[]","[{'title': 'mckenzie v us citizenship & immigration services', 'chunk': '50475, 50496 (Oct. 7, 1991).

"Under what circumstances may a U.S. District Court deny a prevailing party's motion for attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) due to insufficient proof of financial eligibility, even when an affidavit from the party attests to meeting the statutory net worth requirement?","A U.S. District Court may deny in part, without prejudice, a motion for attorney's fees under the EAJA when a prevailing party's affidavit asserting compliance with the $2,000,000 net worth requirement is insufficient, particularly when challenged by defendants citing record evidence that suggests a potentially higher net worth. While an affidavit can be an efficient way to present evidence of net worth, the court must assess the entire record to determine if the financial eligibility burden of proof is met. If the record contains significant information about the party's finances—such as ownership stakes in corporations with substantial assets, past income, or declared net worth figures—that raises concerns about the accuracy of a bare affidavit, the party must provide additional documentation regarding their assets and liabilities to reconcile the affidavit with the balance of the record. Failure to do so, by not providing documentation that aligns with or explains away conflicting record evidence, constitutes a failure to meet the burden of proof, leading the court to deny the motion without prejudice and potentially order supplemental briefing.","[]","['broaddus v u.s. army corps of engineers', 'alyeska pipeline serv. co. v wilderness socy', 'united states v.', 'sosebee v astrue', 'scarborough v principi', 'wash. all. of tech. workers v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'ivy sports med. llc v burwell', 'herman & maclean v huddleston', 'haselwander v mchugh', 'hirschey v ferc', 'huashan zhang v u.s. citizenship & immigr. servs.', 'shooting star ranch llc v united states', 'natl assn of mfrs. v dept of lab.', 'zhang v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'cobell v norton']","[]","[{'title': 'farroukh v united states citizenship & immigration services, et al.', 'chunk': ""Info Labs, Inc. filed a motion for attorneys' fees and costs under the Equal Access to Justice Act.

"An asylum seeker, Mr. X, claims he fears torture if returned to his home country. He alleges that he was severely beaten and robbed by two uniformed police officers who forcibly entered his home, accusing him of a crime they knew he did not commit, and explicitly stated they were doing so because Mr. X had previously reported a corrupt local official. Mr. X states these officers were known for taking bribes and acting on personal vendettas, and that the government often claims such officers are ""rogue agents"" not acting officially.

Under Department of Justice regulations implementing the CAT, an act constitutes ""torture"" only if it is inflicted or approved by a public official or other person ""acting in an official capacity,"" which means acting ""under color of law."" The ""under color of law"" standard is the *only* standard to apply; the concept of a distinct ""rogue official"" standard is rejected as risking confusion. The standard draws no categorical distinction between the acts of low- and high-level officials. An official acts ""under color of law"" when they exercise power possessed by virtue of law and made possible only because they were clothed with the authority of law. This often involves the misuse of authority, where an official uses their official authority to fulfill personal objectives. Therefore, even if the officers were motivated by personal vendettas or were considered ""corrupt, low-level agents,"" their actions would still be ""under color of law"" if they misused their power as police officers, clothed with the authority of law, to inflict the harm.

Furthermore, the BIA's decision not to require the government to file briefing does not establish bias, as regulations allow both parties to forgo filing briefs. Finally, the court rejected the argument that a single-member BIA panel decision, which cannot reverse an immigration judge's order unless plainly consistent with and required by an intervening change in law, violates due process.

"A lawful permanent resident seeking naturalization was convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, causing a loss of over $10,000. The sentencing for this offense was less than one year of imprisonment. Can this conviction be deemed an ""aggravated felony"" under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), thus precluding naturalization due to a lack of good moral character, even if the offense might also be classified as a ""theft offense"" under § 1101(a)(43)(G) which requires a minimum one-year imprisonment term?","Yes, the conviction can be deemed an aggravated felony. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has expressly overruled the ""hybrid offense"" theory established in *Nugent v. Ashcroft*. An offense that ""involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000"" is an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) regardless of whether it also meets the requirements of any other subparagraph, such as the one-year imprisonment threshold for ""theft offenses"" under § 1101(a)(43)(G). Each subparagraph of § 1101(a)(43) lays out a separate aggravated felony, and there is no indication in the statute that an offense must satisfy multiple subparagraphs. Therefore, a conviction for conspiracy to commit wire fraud with a stipulated loss exceeding $10,000 qualifies as an aggravated felony under § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), precluding a finding of good moral character for naturalization.","[]","['biskupski v attorney general', 'bobb v atty gen.', 'united states v.', 'ins v cardoza-fonseca', 'nugent v ashcroft', 'kawashima v holder', 'ruiz-martinez v mukasey', 'doe', 'al-sharif v united states citizenship & immigration services']","[]","[{'title': 'anderson v liberty lobby, inc.', 'chunk': ""This case summary involves DLS Precision Fab LLC, which was found liable for violations of 8 U.S.C. § 1324a.

"A rancher whose property is near the U.S. southern border experienced significant damage, including lost cattle profits, depleted water, and trash, directly linked to a dramatic increase in illegal immigration following the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) decisions to halt border wall construction and terminate the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) without conducting environmental analyses. Does this rancher have legal standing to challenge DHS's actions, and would DHS be found in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)?","Yes, the rancher (Steven Smith) has standing to sue, and DHS would be found in violation of NEPA.
The Court found that Smith suffered concrete and particularized injuries, including lost profits from cattle that ingested trash, depleted water reserves due to migrants tying down float systems in water troughs, and trespass with detritus left behind by migrants. These harms are considered concrete ""monetary injury"" or bear a close relationship to harms traditionally recognized in American courts. His testimony about experiencing these injuries almost daily in the last three years, in contrast to a couple of times a month during the previous administration, was found credible.
Causation was established through an ""enticement theory"" with three links supported by a preponderance of the evidence:
1.  **Relaxed Policies:** DHS's decisions to halt border wall construction and terminate MPP relaxed deterrents and consequences for illegal immigration, reversing a 27-year proven border security strategy and effectively ""unsecuring the border almost overnight,"" according to expert testimony from former senior border officials.
2.  **Responsive Migrants:** Migrants reacted predictably to these relaxed policies, leading to a sharp uptick in illegal immigration, which overwhelmed Border Patrol resources nationwide and diverted manpower away from areas like the Tucson Sector, where Smith lives, thus increasing unpatrolled areas.
3.  **Related Harms:** This dramatic increase in illegal immigration directly led to the increased migrant traffic on Smith’s land, causing the damage to his property, water, and cattle.
The Court concluded that both the cessation of border wall construction and the rescission of MPP constituted ""major Federal actions"" under NEPA, requiring environmental analysis. DHS concededly failed to perform this analysis, thus acting ""without observance of procedure required by law"" in violation of NEPA.","[]","['entick v carrington', 'cannon v district of columbia', 'new york v u.s. dept of com.', 'murthy v missouri', 'cei v nhtsa', 'simon v e. ky. welfare rts. org.', 'defs. of wildlife inc. v endangered species sci. auth.', 'tozzi v hhs', 'massachusetts v e.p.a.', 'fla. audubon socy v bentsen', 'mollan v torrance', 'campbell v natl union fire ins. co. of pittsburgh pa', 'new jersey v epa', 'friends of the earth inc. v laidlaw envt servs. toc inc.', 'bennett v spear', 'rumsfeld v forum for acad. & instl rts. inc.', 'trudeau v ftc', 'lujan v defs. of wildlife', 'arpaio v obama', 'ramirez v u.s. immigr. & customs enft', 'united states v richardson', 'flores v johnson', 'transunion llc v ramirez', 'natl wrestling coaches assn v dept of educ.', 'block v meese', 'competitive enter. inst. v fcc', 'grupo dataflux v atlas glob. grp. l.p.', 'massachusetts coalition for immigration reform v us citizenship and immigration services', 'energy future coalition v epa', 'natl parks conserv. assn v manson', 'spokeo inc. v robbins']","[]","[{'title': 'norton v s. utah wilderness all.', 'chunk': ""The case, Wei Lai Development LLC, et al. v.

"An individual applies for an EB-5 visa, having invested capital in a new commercial enterprise. Their investment agreement includes a ""call option,"" which grants the company the choice to buy out the investor's interest at a specified price after certain conditions are met, but does not give the investor any right to demand repayment.

Is USCIS's denial likely to be upheld as consistent with federal law and prior agency decisions?","No, USCIS's denial based solely on the presence of a call option that does not grant the investor a right to demand repayment is unlikely to be upheld. The court found that USCIS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it declared investors ineligible for visas due to call options, concluding that such options do not provide investors with any right to repayment and therefore still place their capital at risk.

"A U-visa applicant, whose application has been pending for over four years, files a lawsuit against USCIS alleging unreasonable delay in determining their eligibility for the U-visa waitlist and failure to issue interim employment authorization documents (EAD). The applicant cites a 2011 regulation mandating EAD adjudication within 90 days or the issuance of interim documents. The government moves to dismiss all claims, arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction under IIRIRA provisions (8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(g), 1252(a)(5), and 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)) and failure to state a claim, further contending that the 2011 EAD regulation was repealed in 2017 and therefore does not apply. How should the court rule on these claims?","The court should rule as follows:
1.  **Jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(g) and 1252(a)(5):** The court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint. These IIRIRA provisions do not apply because the plaintiff is not challenging the commencement, adjudication, or execution of a removal order, nor seeking review of a removal order. Instead, the claims challenge the government's delay in adjudicating U-visa waitlist eligibility and work authorization.
2.  **Unreasonable Delay in U-Visa Waitlist Eligibility (APA & Mandamus):**
    *   **Jurisdiction:** The court has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). Determining eligibility for the U-visa waitlist is a mandatory assessment, not a discretionary decision specified by statute, as 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(2) requires eligible petitioners to be placed on the waitlist.
    *   **Merits (Failure to State a Claim):** The plaintiff fails to state a claim for unreasonable delay. While the four-year delay is substantial and several ""TRAC test"" factors favor the plaintiff (e.g., sense of Congress for 180-day processing, human welfare interests, prejudice by delay), the D.C. Circuit precedent places significant weight on the ""competing priorities"" factor. A judicial order expediting this single application would merely shift the plaintiff ahead of thousands of other equally worthy applicants, creating more unfairness than it would remedy, and would interfere with the agency's resource allocation, which is a matter for the political branches.
3.  **Failure to Adjudicate EAD under 8 U.S.C. § 1184(p)(6) (APA & Mandamus):** The court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this claim. The statute explicitly states that ""The Secretary may grant work authorization,"" indicating a purely discretionary decision. Therefore, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) strips the court of jurisdiction to review the Secretary's handling of such discretionary EAD requests, and there is no clear duty to act required for APA or mandamus relief.
4.  **Failure to Issue Interim Work Authorization under 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) (2011) (APA & Mandamus):**
    *   **Applicable Regulation:** The 2011 version of 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) applies. It was in effect when the plaintiff filed their application in June 2016 and when the 90-day adjudication period expired in September 2016. Applying the later-effective 2017 repeal retroactively would strip the plaintiff of a vested right to interim work authorization, which is impermissible without express congressional authorization.
    *   **Jurisdiction:** The court has jurisdiction. The 2011 regulation's language (""USCIS will adjudicate... within 90 days... Failure to complete the adjudication within 90 days will result in the grant..."") creates a clear, mandatory duty for the agency to either adjudicate or issue interim EAD, making it a discrete agency action required to be taken under the APA. Judicial review is not precluded by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as that section applies only to statutory, not regulatory, discretion.
    *   **Merits (Stated a Claim):** The plaintiff has stated a claim for agency action unlawfully withheld. The plain language of the 2011 regulation requires adjudication or issuance of interim EAD within 90 days of receipt, which the agency failed to do. The agency's interpretation that the 90-day clock begins only after a threshold determination on an underlying benefit has no support in the regulation's text and is contradicted by the agency's own reasons for repealing the rule.
5.  **Challenge to Repeal of 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) (2011) without Notice-and-Comment:** This claim is dismissed. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendants' arguments in opposition, thereby conceding the issue. Furthermore, the complaint lacked factual allegations supporting the claim, and the Federal Register documentation shows that the agency followed proper notice-and-comment procedures for the repeal.","[]","['united states v.', 'browning v clinton', 'jay v boyd', 'natl assn of mfrs. v sec', 'am. natl ins. v fdic', 'astakhov v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'islam v heinauer', 'schuler v united states', 'sparrow v united air lines inc.', 'herbert v natl acad. of scis.', 'garcia uranga v us citizenship & immigration services', 'bell atl. corp. v twombly', 'kokkonen v guardian life ins. co. of am.', 'a.c.c.s. v nielsen', 'bowen v georgetown univ. hosp.', 'reno v am.-arab anti-discrimination comm.', 'perez v mortg. bankers assn', 'ashcroft v iqbal', 'lujan v defs. of wildlife', 'gen. motors corp. v epa', 'am. hosp. assn v burwell', 'khan v johnson', 'landgraf v usi film prods.', 'mashpee wampanoag tribal council inc. v norton', 'liberty fund inc. v chao', 'scolaro v d.c. bd. of elections & ethics', 'jerome stevens pharms. inc. v fda']","[]","[{'title': 'aguilar-mendez', 'chunk': 'The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s request for voluntary departure.

"An immigration advocacy group, similar to the American Immigration Council, seeks records from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regarding a program where CBP agents conducted credible fear interviews. The group specifically requested records related to training materials, supervision protocols, and grant/denial rates, but CBP only searched for a limited set of categories. USCIS and DHS withheld several documents, including drafts, issue papers, briefing memos, and an email containing names of CBP officers, citing deliberative process and personal privacy exemptions. The group challenges the adequacy of CBP's search and the agencies' withholdings. How would a federal court likely rule on these challenges based on the provided case precedent?","Based on the provided case precedent, a federal court would likely rule as follows:
1.  **CBP's Search:** The court would find CBP's search insufficient. CBP only searched for two out of seven requested categories, relying on the assertion that DHS and USCIS were the ""likely custodians"" for the others. The court found this justification inadequate, as CBP's role was not sufficiently limited to excuse it from searching other relevant categories, nor was the search description for the categories it *did* search adequately detailed. CBP would be ordered to conduct a more comprehensive search.
2.  **Exemption 5 (Deliberative Process) Withholdings by DHS and USCIS:** The court would likely find that DHS and USCIS did not adequately justify these withholdings. The agencies' descriptions of the documents (drafts, issue papers, briefing memos, meeting topics) and their role in a deliberative process were deemed too broad and conclusory, lacking specific detail on the decision or policy involved, the nature of the deliberation, or the specific foreseeable harm disclosure would cause. The agencies would be given an opportunity to supplement their Vaughn indices with more detailed justifications or release the documents, and in camera inspection would likely be ordered given the small number of documents.
3.  **Exemptions 6 and 7(C) (Personal Privacy) Withholdings by USCIS for CBP Officer Names:** The court would find these withholdings improper. While the document (an email concerning job duties) was considered a ""similar file"" under Exemption 6, the privacy interest in the CBP officers' names was deemed de minimis, especially compared to unredacted USCIS asylum officers' names in the same document. Even if a substantial privacy interest existed, the public interest in understanding government operations, particularly given that CBP officers were instructed not to disclose their identity during interviews, would significantly outweigh it. The court would order the unredacted document to be produced.","[]","['brown v dept of state', 'defs. of wildlife v u.s. border patrol', 'ground saucer watch inc. v cia', 'life extension found. inc. v irs', 'oglesby v u.s. dept of the army', 'u.s. dept of interior v klamath water users protective assn', 'competitive enter. inst. v epa', 'mil. audit project v casey', 'dept of air force v rose', 'ctr. for pub. integrity v fed. election commn', 'pronin v fed. bureau of prisons', 'national press club journalism institute v us immigration and customs enforcement', 'nlrb v robbins tire & rubber co.', 'mapother v dept of just.', 'u.s. fish and wildlife serv. v sierra club inc.', 'nlrb v sears roebuck & co.', 'valencia-lucena v u.s. coast guard', 'u.s. dept of state v wash. post co.', 'reps. comm. for freedom of the press v fbi', 'mead data cent. inc. v u.s. dept of air force', 'safecard servs. inc. v sec', 'meeropol v meese', 'multi ag media llc v dept of agric.', 'petroleum info. corp. v u.s. dept of interior', 'coastal states gas corp. v dept of energy', 'morley v cia', 'prop. of the people inc. v off. of mgmt. and budget', 'liberation newspaper v dept of state', 'ancient coin collectors guild v u.s. dept of state', 'am. ctr. for l. & just. v u.s. dept of state', 'baker & hostetler llp v u.s. dept of commerce', 'arthur andersen & co. v irs', 'ctr. for investigative reporting v u.s. customs & border prot.', 'transgender law center v united states immigration & customs enforcement', 'prison legal news v samuels', 'bloche v dept of def. no. 7-cv-', 'schiffer v fbi', 'gray v southwest airlines inc.', 'pub. citizen inc. v off. of mgmt. & budget', 'a.b.-b. v morgan', 'citizens for resp. and ethics in wash. v u.s. dept of just.', 'tokar v u.s. dept of just.', 'dibacco v u.s. army', 'rosenberg v u.s. dept of def.', 'alyeska pipeline serv. co. v u.s. epa', 'american immigration council v us customs and border protection', 'loving v dept of def.']","[]","[{'title': 'ms q v us immigration and customs enforcement', 'chunk': 'No. 7] is  GRANTED; it is  FURTHER ORDERED that defendants and their officers, agents, servants,  employees, attorneys, and all those who are in active concert or participation with them, must  reunify plaintiff Ms. Q. and her four-year-old son, J., on or before midnight on November 30,  2018; and it is  FURTHER ORDERED that defendants shall submit a status report on or before  November 30, 2018 at 5:00 p.m., explaining the status of the ordered reunification and/or the  measures defendants are taking or have taken to expedite immediate reunification.

"A plaintiff filed a lawsuit in the District of Columbia challenging the denial of an immigrant visa petition by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The petition was processed and denied at a USCIS service center located in the Northern District of Texas, and the plaintiff resides in Maryland. The government has moved to transfer the case to either the Northern District of Texas or the District of Maryland. In which district would venue be proper for this action, and should the case be transferred there?","Venue would be proper in the Northern District of Texas, and the case should be transferred there.
An action against the federal government can be brought in any judicial district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Here, the plaintiff's Form I-140 petition was processed and denied at USCIS’s Texas Service Center, located in the Northern District of Texas, meaning a substantial part of the events occurred there. The plaintiff's argument that the events in Texas were merely a byproduct of D.C. policy decisions is rejected because the claim focuses on the application of eligibility criteria to a specific petition in Texas, not a challenge to national policy from D.C.

The case should be transferred to the Northern District of Texas based on both public and private interests.
*   **Public Interests:** The controversy is local to the Northern District of Texas, where the petition was processed and denied. Courts routinely find that cases challenging immigration petition denials should be decided where the petition was processed. The familiarity of courts with federal law is neutral, and while the Northern District of Texas is marginally more congested than the D.C. court, it does not have such enormous backlogs to prevent transfer, especially given the strong local interest.
*   **Private Interests:** The government prefers the Northern District of Texas. The claim arose in that district. Convenience to the parties, witnesses, and evidence also favors the Northern District of Texas, as any relevant witnesses or documents are most likely located there. The plaintiff's choice to litigate in D.C. receives only minimal deference because the plaintiff does not reside in D.C. and the factual allegations lack a significant nexus to D.C. officials or their specific actions.

Therefore, considering all factors, the case should be transferred to the Northern District of Texas. The transferring court found it appropriate to transfer the case without fully resolving its own subject matter jurisdiction, leaving that question for the transferee court to determine.","[]","['relx inc. v baran', 'trout unlimited v u.s. dept of agric.', 'al-ahmed v chertoff', 'pac. mar. assn v nlrb', 'bourdon v dhs', 'fine cuts inc. v dhs', 'ike v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'pasem v uscis', 'ravulapalli v napolitano', 'diaz v sessions', 'ngonga v sessions', 'pub. citizen v u.s. dist. court for d.c.', 'salha v dhs', 'greater yellowstone coal. v bosworth', 'gyau v sessions', 'van dusen v barrack']","[]","[{'title': 'sinochem international co. v malaysia international shipping corp.', 'chunk': ""The provided document discusses a civil action, Wei Lai Development LLC, et al., v.

"Under U.S. immigration law, can a foreign-born child claim citizenship through a parent who never actually resided in the U.S., by arguing that the parent constructively satisfied statutory physical presence requirements for citizenship transmission, particularly when a foreign government's actions, rather than a U.S. government error, prevented actual physical presence?","No, the court affirmed that the constructive physical presence doctrine does not apply to transmit United States citizenship under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 in such circumstances. The Act's plain language provides only limited exceptions to physical presence requirements (for military service or government employment), and courts decline to read broader equitable exceptions into the statute. The precedent allowing constructive physical presence for transmission (*Matter of Navarrete*) is specifically limited to scenarios where a U.S. government error prevented compliance with the physical presence requirements. Since no U.S. government error caused the father's inability to reside in the U.S., the doctrine does not apply.

The original employer fails to respond, and USCIS denies the petition. The beneficiary attempts to appeal the denial but is told they are not a recognized party. Did USCIS act improperly in this scenario?","Yes, USCIS acted improperly. The court ruled that when an I-140 petition is pending before USCIS and the agency receives notice that the beneficiary has requested to port to a new employer, USCIS acts inconsistently with the portability provision (8 U.S.C. § 1154(j)) if it continues to treat only the original employer as a party to the petition adjudication proceeding. Regulations preventing I-140 beneficiaries from being recognized as parties to petition proceedings and from appealing denials are deemed a ""mere nullity"" in this context because they conflict with the statutory scheme created by the portability provision. USCIS should have treated the I-140 beneficiary as a party, sent the Request for Evidence to the beneficiary, and permitted the beneficiary to appeal the denial.

"An alien from El Salvador seeks asylum and withholding of removal in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security presents an Interpol Red Notice indicating an active warrant for the alien's arrest in El Salvador for violating Article 345 of the Salvadoran Penal Code, which proscribes participation in an illicit organization whose purpose is the commission of crimes. The Red Notice also suggests the alien is a ""hit man"" for a gang. Can the Interpol Red Notice constitute sufficient evidence to trigger the serious nonpolitical crime bar, and how would the court assess the ""seriousness"" of such a crime for purposes of asylum and withholding eligibility?","Yes, an Interpol Red Notice may constitute reliable evidence indicating that the serious nonpolitical crime bar for asylum and withholding of removal applies to an alien. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can meet its burden to shift the burden of proof to the alien by presenting ""some evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that one or more grounds for mandatory denial of the application for relief may apply,"" which an Interpol Red Notice, corroborated by other evidence like a Form I-213, can satisfy. An Interpol Red Notice is considered reliable for what it purports to be: a request by a member country for provisional arrest based on a valid national arrest warrant for a serious ordinary law crime.

Once the burden shifts, the alien must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the serious nonpolitical crime bar does not apply. Regarding the ""seriousness"" of the crime, a violation of Article 345 of the Salvadoran Penal Code, which criminalizes participation in an illicit organization whose purpose is the commission of crimes and uses violent means, is considered ""serious."" This assessment takes into account whether the conduct involved a substantial risk of violence and harm to persons and the maximum term of imprisonment (e.g., up to 9 years for Article 345).

"An asylum seeker submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for all documents related to their asylum application, which was granted in 2013.

"Imagine a noncitizen, Ms. A, was convicted under a state law that criminalizes accessory-after-the-fact with a ""general intent"" requirement. Federal immigration authorities classify this conviction as an ""aggravated felony"" related to obstruction of justice, which generically requires ""specific intent,"" and initiate expedited removal proceedings.

Consequently, the noncitizen was improperly designated as an aggravated felon. Furthermore, the expedited removal order would be found to violate the noncitizen's due process rights due to DHS's failure to follow regulatory procedures, such as issuing a Final Administrative Removal Order (FARO) before or on the same day as the Notice of Intent (NOI) and not providing the required response period, which prejudiced the noncitizen by preventing a challenge to the aggravated felony designation.
