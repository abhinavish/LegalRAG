"An individual in removal proceedings had their application for asylum and other relief denied due to failure to submit biometrics, despite being previously instructed by the Immigration Judge while pro se. They subsequently retained counsel, who also failed to advise them about the biometrics requirement. After the denial, and more than 90 days after the final order of removal, they filed a motion to reopen, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel prevented a merits hearing and that this justified equitable tolling of the filing deadline. They also requested *sua sponte* reopening by the Board of Immigration Appeals. Could this individual successfully overturn the denial of their motion to reopen based on equitable tolling due to counsel's ineffectiveness or compel the BIA to *sua sponte* reopen their case?","No, the individual could not successfully overturn the denial of their motion to reopen based on equitable tolling or compel the BIA to *sua sponte* reopen their case. The court found that even if counsel's failure to remind about biometrics was ineffective, there was no argument that counsel's ineffectiveness caused the motion to reopen itself to be untimely filed. The failure to move in a timely fashion to reopen was an independent basis for denying relief, and the individual failed to show any basis for equitable tolling of the filing deadline for reopening. Additionally, the court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA's discretionary decision not to invoke its *sua sponte* authority to reopen a case.","[('usc', '8', '1227'), ('usc', '8', '1229')]","['mata v lynch', 'dada v mukasey', 'mejia v whitaker', 'united states v english', 'eneugwu v garland', 'lugo-resendez v lynch', 'ramos-portillo v barr', 'heckler v chaney', 'diaz v sessions', 'rashidi v american president lines', 'garcia v garland', 'kucana v holder']","[{'title': ('usc', '8', '1252.'), 'chunk': ""(3) Service The respondent is the Attorney General The petition shall be served on the Attorney General and on the officer or employee of the Service in charge of the Service district in which the final order of removal under section 1229a of this title was entered Service of the petition on the officer or employee does not stay the removal of an alien pending the court's decision on the petition, unless the court orders otherwise The alien shall serve and file a brief in connection with a petition for judicial review not later than 40 days after the date on which the administrative record is available, and may serve and file a reply brief not later than 14 days after service of the brief of the Attorney General, and the court may not extend these deadlines except upon motion for good cause shown If an alien fails to file a brief within the time provided in this paragraph, the court shall dismiss the appeal unless a manifest injustice would result""}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1229'), 'chunk': ""(7) Limitation on discretionary relief for failure to appear Any alien against whom a final order of removal is entered in absentia under this subsection and who, at the time of the notice described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1229(a) of this title, was provided oral notice, either in the alien's native language or in another language the alien understands, of the time and place of the proceedings and of the consequences under this paragraph of failing, other than because of exceptional circumstances (as defined in subsection (e)(1)) to attend a proceeding under this section, shall not be eligible for relief under section 1229b, 1229c, 1255, 1258, or 1259 of this title for a period of 10 years after the date of the entry of the final order of removal""}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1184.'), 'chunk': ""(3) As a condition for the admission, and continued stay in lawful status, of such a nonimmigrant, the nonimmigrant— (A) shall report not less often than quarterly to the Attorney General such information concerning the alien's whereabouts and activities as the Attorney General may require; (B) may not be convicted of any criminal offense punishable by a term of imprisonment of 1 year or more after the date of such admission; (C) must have executed a form that waives the nonimmigrant's right to contest, other than on the basis of an application for withholding of removal, any action for removal of the alien instituted before the alien obtains lawful permanent resident status; and (D) shall abide by any other condition, limitation, or restriction imposed by the Attorney General""}]","[{'title': 'brooks v board of immigration appeals', 'chunk': 'is presumptive evidence of  intent to use the same unlawfully against another.”).

"A group of international students had their F-1 visas terminated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after discovering they were ""enrolled"" in a sham university created by DHS as part of a sting operation. The termination letter stated their SEVIS record and Form I-20 had been set to ""Terminated due to your fraudulent enrollment."" The students filed a federal lawsuit challenging the termination, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and Due Process, and seeking an order prohibiting the Government from finding they committed fraud. The District Court dismissed the claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding the DHS action was not final because reinstatement proceedings were pending and the case was not ripe for review. The students appealed. If these students were to proceed with their appeal, would the appellate court likely find that the DHS's termination of their F-1 visas constitutes a final agency action ripe for judicial review under the APA?","Yes, the appellate court would likely find that DHS's termination of the F-1 visas constitutes a final agency action ripe for judicial review under the APA. The termination order marked the consummation of the agency's decision-making process by stripping the students of their lawful status and placing a fraud notation on their records, thus determining a ""right or obligation.""

The court would disagree with the District Court's conclusions regarding finality and ripeness for two main reasons:
1.  **Finality of Agency Action:**
    *   **Reinstatement Proceedings Are Not a Prerequisite for Review:** There is no statutory or regulatory requirement for students to seek reinstatement after F-1 visa termination. Moreover, reinstatement proceedings do not provide a mechanism to review the propriety of the original termination order or the ""fraudulent enrollment"" decision. Even if reinstatement is granted, it does not ""wipe away"" the prior agency decision.
    *   **Removal Proceedings Are Not a Prerequisite for Review:** The finality of an order cannot be conditioned on potential, uninitiated removal proceedings, which may never occur. Furthermore, neither immigration judges nor the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) have the authority to review the USCIS's discretionary denial of a motion to reinstate student status or to overturn the initial termination decision. Therefore, removal proceedings do not offer an opportunity to contest the agency action. The termination is the culmination, not the initiation, of the agency's decision-making process.
2.  **Ripeness for Review:**
    *   The case is ripe because the parties are in a sufficiently adversarial posture, and the students are genuinely aggrieved by the termination of their lawful status and the permanent ""fraud"" notation on their records. The government's shifting position on whether the students were victims or participants in the fraud further underscores the need for judicial review that would otherwise be absent. Ongoing reinstatement proceedings do not render the case unripe because they do not provide an avenue to review ICE's termination decision.","[('usc', '8', '1227'), ('cfr', '8', '208.14'), ('cfr', '8', '214.1'), ('cfr', '8', '214.3'), ('cfr', '8', '214.4'), ('usc', '8', '1201'), ('cfr', '8', '214.2'), ('usc', '8', '1101')]","['palakovic v wetzel', 'ghorbani v ins', 'peachlum v city of york', 'kashani v nelson', 'hosseini v johnson', 'qureshi v holder', 'bennett v spear', 'ftc v standard oil co. of cal.', 'pinho v gonzales', 'felmeister v office of attorney ethics', 'cabaccang v uscis', 'tooloee v ins', 'marathon petroleum corp. v secy of finance', 'babbitt v united farm workers natl union', 'young dong kim v holder', 'darby v cisneros', 'jie fang v dir us immigration & customs enforcement']","[{'title': ('usc', '22', '6741.'), 'chunk': '(a) Regulations on recordkeeping (1) Requirements The United States National Authority shall ensure that regulations are prescribed that require each person located in the United States who produces, processes, consumes, exports, or imports, or proposes to produce, process, consume, export, or import, a chemical substance that is subject to the Convention to— (A) maintain and permit access to records related to that production, processing, consumption, export, or import of such substance; and (B) submit to the Director of the United States National Authority such reports as the United States National Authority may reasonably require to provide to the Organization, pursuant to subparagraph 1(a) of the Annex on Confidentiality of the Convention, the minimum amount of information and data necessary for the timely and efficient conduct by the Organization of its responsibilities under the Convention'}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1186'), 'chunk': ""(3) Personal interview The interview under subsection (c)(1)(B) shall be conducted within 90 days after the date of submitting a petition under subsection (c)(1)(A) and at a local office of the Department of Homeland Security, designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security, which is convenient to the parties involved The Secretary of Homeland Security, in the Secretary's discretion, may waive the deadline for an interview under subsection (c)(1)(B) or the requirement for such an interview according to criteria developed by U.S Citizenship and Immigration Services, in consultation with its Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate and U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement, provided that such criteria do not include a reduction of case processing times or the allocation of adjudicatory resources A waiver may not be granted under this subparagraph if the alien to be interviewed— (i) invested in a regional center, new commercial enterprise, or job-creating entity that was sanctioned under section 1153(b)(5) of this title; or (ii) is in a class of aliens determined by the Secretary to be threats to public safety or national security""}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '279.'), 'chunk': '(2) Coordination with other entities; no release on own recognizance In making determinations described in paragraph (1)(C), the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement— (A) shall consult with appropriate juvenile justice professionals, the Director of the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of Border Security to ensure that such determinations ensure that unaccompanied alien children described in such subparagraph— (i) are likely to appear for all hearings or proceedings in which they are involved; (ii) are protected from smugglers, traffickers, or others who might seek to victimize or otherwise engage them in criminal, harmful, or exploitive activity; and (iii) are placed in a setting in which they are not likely to pose a danger to themselves or others; and (B) shall not release such children upon their own recognizance'}]","[{'title': 'aguilar-mendez', 'chunk': 'The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s request for voluntary departure.

"An individual received a Notice to Appear (NTA) for removal proceedings that omitted the specific date and time of the hearing. Subsequently, they received a separate Notice of Hearing (NOH) via regular mail that included all the necessary hearing details. They failed to appear and an in absentia removal order was issued.

They submitted an affidavit attesting to non-receipt. They also requested the immigration judge exercise sua sponte authority to reopen the case.

Based on the provided Fifth Circuit decision, what is the likely outcome of their appeal regarding the rescission of the in absentia order and the denial of the motion to reopen?","The appeal would likely be denied in part and dismissed in part.
1.  **Jurisdiction:** The statutorily deficient NTA, which initially lacked the hearing date and time, did not deprive the immigration judge of jurisdiction to conduct the removal proceedings, as the regulation governing NTAs is a claim-processing rule, not a jurisdictional one.
2.  **Validity of In Absentia Order:** The subsequent NOH, which provided the date and time for the missed hearing, cured any defects in the initial NTA, rendering the in absentia removal order valid under the precedent set by *Campos-Chaves*.

"A non-citizen defendant, whose native language is not English, entered a guilty plea to a first-degree misdemeanor assault charge without an interpreter present at the plea hearing. The defendant never requested an interpreter, and the trial court did not appoint one, though an earlier arraignment entry was stamped ""Order Interpreter – Swahili"" for unknown reasons. During the plea, the trial court read the defendant a form advising of potential immigration consequences (deportation, exclusion, denial of naturalization), and the defendant indicated understanding. Subsequently, the defendant filed a post-sentence motion to withdraw the guilty plea, arguing that a limited understanding of English prevented a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary plea, and that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to adequately advise on the immigration consequences of an assault conviction. The defendant claimed that if properly advised, they would have gone to trial. Should the trial court grant the motion to withdraw the guilty plea?","No, the trial court should deny the motion to withdraw the guilty plea. The defendant's claim of a language barrier preventing a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary plea lacks merit, as the regularity of the plea hearing (where no interpreter was requested or appointed) is presumed due to the absence of a transcript. Additionally, testimony from the defendant's former counsel and probation officer, along with previous trial testimony given by the defendant without an interpreter, demonstrated a sufficient ability to understand and communicate in English at the time of the plea. Regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, the deportation consequence of a first-degree misdemeanor assault conviction is not ""truly clear"" under federal immigration law (8 U.S.C. 1227(a)(2)(A)(i)), as assault ""may or may not involve moral turpitude."" Therefore, counsel was only required to advise the defendant that pleading guilty to assault might carry a risk of adverse immigration consequences. Since counsel's testimony, which the trial court found credible, indicated that she discussed the immigration consequences listed in the plea form with the defendant, her performance was not deficient. As such, no manifest injustice occurred to warrant withdrawing the guilty plea.","[('usc', '8', '8')]","['strickland v washington', 'lovano v lynch', 'state v bozso', 'padilla v kentucky', 'state v ray', 'state v muhire', 'barton v barr', 'state v galdamez', 'state v flores', 'state v smith', 'state v poppel', 'state v riley', 'reyes v lynch', 'state v turner', 'aaaa ents. inc. v river place community urban redevelopment corp.', 'state v miller', 'state v bradley', 'state v castro', 'state v saah', 'yeremin v holder', 'state v hale', 'state v darmond', 'state v banks', 'state v kreuzer', 'state v ogletree', 'state v dalton', 'state v spates', 'state v ayesta', 'state v leifheit', 'state v cardenas', 'state v xie', 'state v pina']","[{'title': ('usc', '19', '4454.'), 'chunk': '(2) Establishment of trade facilitation and capacity building program Not later than 180 days after February 24, 2016, the President shall, in consultation with the Government of Nepal, establish a trade facilitation and capacity building program for Nepal— (A) to enhance the central export promotion agency of Nepal to support successful exporters and to build awareness among potential exporters in Nepal about opportunities abroad and ways to manage trade documentation and regulations in the United States and other countries; (B) to provide export finance training for financial institutions in Nepal and the Government of Nepal; (C) to assist the Government of Nepal in maintaining publication on the Internet of all trade regulations, forms for exporters and importers, tax and tariff rates, and other documentation relating to exporting goods and developing a robust public-private dialogue, through its National Trade Facilitation Committee, for Nepal to identify timelines for implementation of key reforms and solutions, as provided for under the Agreement on Trade Facilitation of the World Trade Organization; and (D) to increase access to guides for importers and exporters, through publication of such guides on the Internet, including rules and documentation for United States tariff preference programs'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '262'), 'chunk': '(h) Operation of ""early warning system"" The Administrator of the Agency for International Development, in consultation with the Secretaries of Treasury and State, shall continue, and work to enhance, the operation of the ""early warning system"", by— (1) instructing overseas missions of the Agency for International Development and embassies of the United States to analyze the impacts of Multilateral Development Bank loans well in advance of a loan\'s approval Such reviews shall address the economic viability of the project; adverse impacts on the environment, natural resources, public health, and indigenous peoples; and recommendations as to measures, including alternatives, that could eliminate or mitigate adverse impacts If not classified under the national security system of classification, such information shall be made available to the public; (2) compiling a list of proposed Multilateral Development Bank loans likely to have adverse impacts on the environment, natural resources, public health, or indigenous peoples The list shall contain the information identified in paragraph (1), shall be updated in consultation with interested members of the public, and shall be made available to the Committees on Appropriations by April 1, 1988 and semiannually thereafter; and (3) creating a cooperative mechanism for sharing information collected through the ""early warning system"" with interested donor and borrowing nations and encouraging the Multilateral Development Banks to institute a similar system'}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '485.'), 'chunk': '(c) Preliminary report Not later than 180 days after December 17, 2004, the program manager shall, in consultation with the Information Sharing Council— (1) submit to the President and Congress a description of the technological, legal, and policy issues presented by the creation of the ISE, and the way in which these issues will be addressed; (2) establish an initial capability to provide electronic directory services, or the functional equivalent, to assist in locating in the Federal Government intelligence and terrorism information and people with relevant knowledge about intelligence and terrorism information; and (3) conduct a review of relevant current Federal agency capabilities, databases, and systems for sharing information'}]","[{'title': 'injeti v united states citizenship & immigration services', 'chunk': '96.

"A software services company, ""GlobalTech Solutions,"" had its H-1B visa petition for a ""Senior Software Engineer"" denied by USCIS on the grounds that it failed to demonstrate the position was a ""specialty occupation"" and did not provide sufficient details on job duties. GlobalTech now seeks to intervene in an ongoing lawsuit filed by another company, ""Innovate Systems,"" whose H-1B petition for a ""Project Manager IT"" was also denied by USCIS for similar reasons (failure to prove specialty occupation and employment relationship). GlobalTech argues that both cases involve common questions of law under the APA regarding USCIS's arbitrary and capricious denials. Should the court grant GlobalTech Solutions' motion for permissive intervention under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(b)?","No, the court should deny GlobalTech Solutions' motion for permissive intervention. Intervention would be inappropriate because it would result in undue delay and the two companies' cases are factually distinct. USCIS's review of H-1B visa petitions is fact-intensive and courts' review is limited to the administrative record. The two companies' petitions would not share a single piece of evidence in common, and the job positions, while broadly involving computer technology, would have significantly varying specific functional responsibilities (e.g., ""Senior Software Engineer"" versus ""Project Manager IT""). Furthermore, Innovate Systems' case likely involves an additional legal question (proving an employer-employee relationship) not present in GlobalTech's case, which could prove dispositive and adds complexity. Given these distinct factual and legal natures, reviewing separate agency decisions and records would inject unnecessary complexity and delay into the existing case. The desire of counsel to coordinate a litigation strategy does not constitute a practical purpose that justifies intervention and would conflict with local rules for random case assignment.","[('usc', '8', '1184'), ('cfr', '8', '214.2'), ('usc', '8', '1182'), ('usc', '8', '1101')]","['sage it inc. v cissna', 'tpi corp. v merchant mart of south carolina inc.', 'securities & exch. commn v everest mgmt. corp.', 'sierra club v van antwerp', 'fogo de chao holdings inc. v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'nyc c.l.a.s.h. inc. v carson', 'massachusetts v microsoft corp.', 'stellar it solutions inc v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'bdpcs inc. v fcc', 'love v vilsack', 'ctr. for biological diversity v epa', 'voltage pictures llc v vazquez', 'eeoc v natl childrens ctr. inc.', 'aziz v trump']","[{'title': ('usc', '6', '124'), 'chunk': '(e) Border intelligence priority (1) In general The Secretary shall make it a priority to assign officers and intelligence analysts under this section from United States Customs and Border Protection, United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Coast Guard to participating State, local, and regional fusion centers located in jurisdictions along land or maritime borders of the United States in order to enhance the integrity of and security at such borders by helping Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement authorities to identify, investigate, and otherwise interdict persons, weapons, and related contraband that pose a threat to homeland security'}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1182.'), 'chunk': '(B) In the case of an application with respect to one or more H–1B nonimmigrants by an employer, the employer is considered to ""displace"" a United States worker from a job if the employer lays off the worker from a job that is essentially the equivalent of the job for which the nonimmigrant or nonimmigrants is or are sought A job shall not be considered to be essentially equivalent of another job unless it involves essentially the same responsibilities, was held by a United States worker with substantially equivalent qualifications and experience, and is located in the same area of employment as the other job'}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '942.'), 'chunk': '(b) Vessels In determining the prioritization of vessels accessing facilities (as defined under section 70101 of title 46), the Commandant of the Coast Guard may, to the extent practicable and consistent with the protocols and plans required under this section to ensure the safe and secure transit of vessels to ports in the United States after a transportation security incident, give priority to a vessel— (1) that has an approved security plan under section 70103(c) of title 46 or a valid international ship security certificate, as provided under part 104 of title 33, Code of Federal Regulations; (2) that is manned by individuals who are described in section 70105(b)(2)(B) of title 46; and (3) that is operated by validated participants in the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program'}]","[{'title': 'judicial watch, inc. v food & drug admin.', 'chunk': ""The court case involves Nelson Mezerhane Gosen, a former Venezuelan television executive, against U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

"After being convicted of conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud and ordered to pay over $200,000 in restitution, an individual is found removable as an aggravated felon. If this individual, while detained and proceeding pro se, files a petition for review of the BIA's order 31 days after it was mailed, can they successfully challenge the use of the restitution amount to establish the aggravated felony, or argue ineffective assistance of counsel in their immigration proceedings?","No, the individual in this situation would likely not successfully challenge the use of the restitution amount to establish the aggravated felony, nor could they argue ineffective assistance of counsel in their immigration proceedings if not properly raised before the BIA.

Firstly, the court would likely have jurisdiction to hear the petition for review, despite it being received 31 days after the BIA order was mailed, because the ""prison mailbox rule"" (Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 25(a)(2)(A)(iii)) applies to pro se detainees in immigration proceedings. This rule deems a filing timely if it is deposited in the institution's internal mail system on or before the last day for filing, with a compliant certificate of service or evidence of deposit.

Secondly, regarding the aggravated felony determination, a restitution order tied to a fraud conspiracy conviction, clearly showing a loss to victims exceeding $10,000, provides clear and convincing evidence to establish that the conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M). The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) is permitted to rely on such sentencing-related material to determine the amount of loss, and the individual's restitution order for $229,717.30 linked to their conviction would be sufficient evidence.

Finally, any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel concerning immigration proceedings cannot be considered by the court if the individual failed to first raise it before the BIA on direct appeal or in a motion to reopen. Failure to exhaust an issue before the BIA is a jurisdictional bar for the appellate court. Additionally, other unreasoned and unsupported claims would likely be considered abandoned.","[('usc', '8', '1227'), ('usc', '8', '1252'), ('usc', '8', '1101')]","['shroff v sessions', 'chavarria-reyes v lynch', 'rodriguez v barr', 'zhu v gonzales', 'guirguis v ins', 'ouedraogo v ins', 'stone v ins', 'omari v holder', 'adon v holder', 'barrientos v lynch', 'goonsuwan v ashcroft', 'arguelles-olivares v mukasey', 'singh v sessions', 'osei fosu v garland', 'chun v ins', 'nijhawan v holder', 'yang v holder', 'navarro-miranda v ashcroft', 'avelar-oliva v barr', 'smith v conner', 'arangoaradondo v ins']","[{'title': ('usc', '8', '1535.'), 'chunk': ""(2) No review of continued detention The determinations and actions of the Attorney General pursuant to section 1537(b)(2)(C) of this title shall not be subject to judicial review, including application for a writ of habeas corpus, except for a claim by the alien that continued detention violates the alien's rights under the Constitution Jurisdiction over any such challenge shall lie exclusively in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.""}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1326.'), 'chunk': '(d) Limitation on collateral attack on underlying deportation order In a criminal proceeding under this section, an alien may not challenge the validity of the deportation order described in subsection (a)(1) or subsection (b) unless the alien demonstrates that— (1) the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order; (2) the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review; and (3) the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.'}, {'title': ('usc', '19', '1677'), 'chunk': '(6) Enforcement of sanctions If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty or to comply with other administrative sanctions after the order imposing such sanctions becomes a final and unappealable order, or after the United States Court of International Trade has entered final judgment in favor of the administering authority or the Commission, an action may be filed in such court to enforce the sanctions In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the sanctions shall not be subject to review'}]","[{'title': 'goonsuwan v ashcroft', 'chunk': 'Francis Osei Fosu, also known as Francis Pino Fosu, petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals order, following a conviction for conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud.

The court also determined there was a likelihood of irreparable harm due to the applicant's loss of lawful immigration status and the impending 180-day deadline, which would trigger a three-year bar on readmissibility to the U.S. Consequently, the court stayed USCIS's decision denying Mr. Venkatraman's petition, making the stay retroactive to February 14, 2020, to prevent the accrual of unlawful presence and ensure he retained lawful immigration status.

"A Christian leader from El Salvador, Samuel Argueta-Hernandez, was repeatedly threatened by MS-13 gang members after he refused to pay extortion and collaborate with them, with later threats explicitly mentioning his religious leadership.

If the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denies his applications for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), stating that the harm was not severe enough due to lack of physical injury, that the nexus to his religion was insufficient as the gang's primary motive was extortion, and that the government's temporary safe house and facilitated departure demonstrated a willingness to protect him, how should a U.S. Court of Appeals review this decision?","The U.S. Court of Appeals should grant the petition for review, reverse the BIA's decision, and remand for further proceedings.

Can a U.S. federal court compel USCIS to reverse its discretionary denial of an employment authorization application (Form I-765) and approve it during the pendency of judicial review?,"No, a U.S. federal court cannot compel USCIS to reverse its discretionary denial of an employment authorization application (Form I-765) and approve it during the pendency of judicial review. The denial of an I-765 application is committed to the discretion of USCIS by law, making it unreviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because there are no judicially manageable standards in the relevant statutes or regulations against which to judge USCIS's exercise of discretion. Furthermore, a request to reverse the denial and approve authorization is a mandatory injunction, which is an extraordinary remedy requiring a clear likelihood of success on the merits, a standard the plaintiff failed to meet. The court also cannot compel agency action (like reopening an I-765) under APA § 706(1) unless it's a discrete, ministerial, and non-discretionary duty, which is not the case for I-765 applications. Even if the I-765 denial were reviewable and erroneous, the error would be harmless as the plaintiff currently lacks a pending I-485 application, which is a prerequisite for I-765 approval.","[('usc', '8', '1154'), ('usc', '8', '1324'), ('cfr', '8', '245.25'), ('cfr', '8', '274'), ('usc', '8', '1252'), ('usc', '8', '1182'), ('usc', '8', '1153'), ('usc', '8', '1255'), ('cfr', '8', '204.5'), ('cfr', '8', '103.5')]","['webster v doe', 'city of moundridge v exxon mobil corp.', 'w. org. of res. councils v zinke', 'winter v nat. res. def. council inc.', 'weyerhaeuser co. v u.s. fish & wildlife serv.', 'univ. of tex. v camenisch', 'guevara v holder', 'cuomo v u.s. nuclear reg. commn', 'suarez v cowan', 'salt pond assocs. v u.s. army corps. of engrs', 'dickson v secy of def.', 'sierra club v johnson', 'district of columbia v u.s. dept of agric.', 'confederated tribes of chehalis rsrv. v mnuchin', 'pursuing am.s greatness v fec', 'steenholdt v faa', 'vitarelli v seaton', 'king v leavitt', 'abdullah v bush', 'make the road n.y. v wolf', 'physicians for soc. resp. v wheeler', 'columbia hosp. for women found. inc. v bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ltd.', 'paleteria la michoacana inc. v productos lacteos tocumbo s.a. de c.v.', 'perales v casillas', 'rosario v u.s. citizenship & immigr. servs.', 'dorfmann v boozer', 'kaddoura v gonzales', 'oryszak v sullivan', 'dallas safari club v bernhardt', 'daily caller v u.s. dept of state', 'sherley v sebelius', 'kucana v holder', 'mylan pharms. inc. v shalala', 'vemuri v napolitano', 'league of women voters of u.s. v newby', 'norton v s. utah wilderness all.', 'kondapally v us citizenship and immigration services', 'padula v webster', 'mazurek v armstrong', 'phillip v fairfield univ.', 'heckler v chaney', 'villafranca v cowan', 'aamer v obama']","[{'title': ('usc', '19', '1516'), 'chunk': '(I) judicial review under this subsection shall be stayed during consideration by the committee of the request, and (II) the United States Court of International Trade shall dismiss the action if the committee vacates or remands the binational panel decision to dismiss'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '283'), 'chunk': 'The United States Governor of the Inter-American Development Bank is hereby authorized to agree to and to accept the amendments to the Articles of Agreement in the proposed resolution entitled ""Merger of Inter-regional and Ordinary Capital Resources"".'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '6591.'), 'chunk': '(2) Chapter 4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C 2346 et seq.] (relating to the economic support fund)'}]","[{'title': 'valdiviez-hernandez v holder', 'chunk': 'The court cites Valdiviez-Hernandez v.

"In a class action lawsuit against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) concerning its compliance with statutory obligations for the placement of young adults transitioning from unaccompanied alien children custody, a party seeks to introduce expert testimony from a statistician, a former agency administrator, and a pediatrician. What is the likelihood that the court will allow each expert to testify regarding the agency's compliance and the impact of its practices, based on similar expert challenges?","The court is likely to rule as follows:
1.  **Statistician (Qing Pan and Joseph Gastwirth)**: The court will deny a motion to exclude *certain opinions* of statisticians, allowing them to testify primarily on statistical methodology and data analysis. However, the court will caution that testimony not based on reliable statistical methods or straying into improper legal conclusions regarding ICE's statutory compliance will be given little weight. The court notes that it will entertain objections at trial.
2.  **Former Agency Administrator (Gary Mead)**: The court will grant a motion to exclude the testimony of a former agency administrator. The court finds that such testimony, which consists nearly entirely of legal conclusions about whether ICE is following the requirements of the statute, is inappropriate as expert testimony because it addresses the ultimate question before the court and would not assist the factfinder.
3.  **Pediatrician (Dr. Julie Linton)**: The court will deny a motion to exclude the testimony of a pediatrician. While her testimony on the physical and mental health-related effects of adult detention on immigrant teenagers may not touch on the central merits issues of statutory compliance, it is deemed relevant to the critical questions of remedies, specifically the four-factor test for injunctive relief (irreparable injury, adequacy of legal remedy, balance of hardships, and public interest).","[('usc', '8', '1232')]","['garcia ramirez v us immigration and custom enforcement', 'williams v johnson', 'u.s. ex rel. mossey v pal-tech inc.', 'dl v district of columbia', 'khairkhwa v obama', 'kumho tire co. v carmichael', 'nat. res. def. council v u.s. envtl prot. agency', 'luce v united states', 'groobert v president & dirs. of georgetown coll.', 'chesapeake climate action network v export-import bank of the u.s.', 'victorias secret stores brand mgmt. inc. v sexy hair concepts llc', 'mannino v intl mfg. co.', 'joseph s. v hogan', 'burkhart v wash. metro. area transit auth.', 'daubert v merrell dow pharm. inc.', 'barnes v district of columbia']","[{'title': ('usc', '19', '4532.'), 'chunk': ""(C) The information a producer of passenger vehicles or light trucks is required to provide, in the producer's request to use the alternative staging regime, to demonstrate the actions that the producer will take to be prepared to meet all the requirements set forth in articles 2 through 7 of the automotive appendix after the alternative staging regime period has expired, including the following: (i) A statement identifying which of the requirements set forth in articles 2 through 7 of the automotive appendix that the producer expects it will be unable to meet upon entry into force of the USMCA based on current business plans""}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '6713.'), 'chunk': '(2) United States actions in courts outside the United States The Attorney General is authorized to seek any and all available redress in any international tribunal for indemnification to the United States for any liability imposed on the United States by virtue of the actions of an inspector of the Technical Secretariat, and to seek such redress in the courts of the foreign nation from which the inspector is a national'}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '1184.'), 'chunk': '(f) Reporting requirements Not later than 2 years after the date of regulation issuance, the Secretary shall review implementation of the training program of a representative sample of over-the-road bus operators and over-the-road bus frontline employees, and report to the appropriate congressional committees of such reviews The Secretary may submit the report in both classified and redacted formats as necessary.'}]","[{'title': 'judicial watch, inc. v food & drug admin.', 'chunk': ""The court case involves Nelson Mezerhane Gosen, a former Venezuelan television executive, against U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

"Can an immigrant investor successfully sue U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for unreasonable delay in adjudicating their Form I-526 petition under the Administrative Procedure Act or the Mandamus Act, given that the petition has been pending for approximately three to four years, the agency employs a visa availability and first-in, first-out processing method, and there is no binding statutory timetable for adjudication?","No, an immigrant investor cannot successfully sue USCIS for unreasonable delay under these circumstances. The court found that the TRAC factors, used to evaluate the reasonableness of agency delay, favored the defendants. Specifically:
1.  **Rule of Reason:** USCIS's ""visa availability"" and ""first-in, first-out"" processing method is a ""rule of reason"" and ""identifiable rationale"" that prioritizes applicants for whom visas are available, which courts in this District have consistently found reasonable. A three to four-year delay, while significant, falls within the range of what courts have deemed reasonable for immigration petitions in the absence of specific congressional guidance.
2.  **Statutory Timetable:** Congress has not imposed a binding statutory timetable for adjudicating Form I-526 petitions. The ""sense of Congress"" language regarding a 180-day processing goal is precatory, not mandatory.
3.  **Higher/Competing Priority:** Expediting the plaintiff's petition would reorder agency priorities and undermine USCIS's allocation of resources by moving the plaintiff ahead of other similarly situated applicants, which courts generally disfavor.
4.  **Human Health and Welfare/Interests Prejudiced:** The plaintiff's asserted hardships, such as an uncertain future or inability to obtain employment, are primarily economic and personal difficulties inherent to the application process, not the kind of serious health and welfare interests typically addressed by these factors.
5.  **Impropriety:** The plaintiff failed to plausibly plead any factual claims of impropriety, offering only conclusory allegations.","[('usc', '8', '1361'), ('cfr', '8', '204.6'), ('usc', '8', '1153'), ('usc', '8', '1571')]","['whitlock v u.s. dept of homeland secy', 'meyou v u.s. dept of state', 'palakuru v renaud', 'telecommunications research & action center v fcc', 'mokkapati v mayorkas', 'telles v mayorkas', 'thakker v renaud', 'nohria v renaud', 'olofin v u.s. citizenship & immigr. servs.', 'emergency coal. to defend educ. travel v dept of treasury', 'zaman v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'patel v united states citizenship & immigration services uscis', 'browning v clinton', 'da costa v immigr. inv. program off.', 'punt v u.s. citizenship & immigr. servs.', 'bell atl. corp. v twombly', 'sissel v u.s. dept of health & hum. servs.', 'skalka v kelly', 'ashcroft v iqbal', 'didban v pompeo', 'sarlak v pompeo', 'liberty fund inc. v chao', 'kangarloo v pompeo']","[{'title': ('usc', '6', '242'), 'chunk': ""(b) Report to Congress Not later than 1 year after December 27, 2022, the CCHT Director shall submit a report to Congress that identifies any legislation that is needed to facilitate the Department of Homeland Security's mission to end human trafficking""}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1255.'), 'chunk': ""(n) Concurrent or subsequent filing of application for adjustment of status based on visa petition approval If the approval of a petition for classification under section 1153(b)(5) of this title would make a visa immediately available to the alien beneficiary, the alien beneficiary's application for adjustment of status under this section shall be considered to be properly filed whether the application is submitted concurrently with, or subsequent to, the visa petition.""}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1365'), 'chunk': '(3) Interoperable data system Not later than 2 years after December 17, 2004, the Secretary shall fully implement an interoperable electronic data system, as required by section 202 of the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act 2 (8 U.S.C 1722) to provide current and immediate access to information in the databases of Federal law enforcement agencies and the intelligence community that is relevant to determine— (A) whether to issue a visa; or (B) the admissibility or deportability of an alien'}]","[{'title': 'sarlak v pompeo', 'chunk': ""Ketankumar Patel sued USCIS for unreasonable delay in adjudicating his Form I-526 EB-5 visa petition.

"An immigrant was given a Notice to Appear (NTA) that did not specify the date or time of their removal hearing.

"An asylum applicant from Cameroon, whose testimony about persecution (arrest, torture, protest involvement) is deemed credible by an Immigration Judge (I.J.), has their application for asylum and withholding of removal denied due to insufficient corroborating evidence. The I.J. finds that affidavits submitted by family and friends lack personal knowledge of the events and that other forms of corroboration (like medical evidence of injuries) were not provided despite being reasonably available. The applicant argues that the I.J. erred by not following the procedures outlined in *Matter of L-A-C-*, which require an I.J. to first identify specific corroborating evidence, then give the applicant an opportunity to explain its absence, and finally state whether that explanation is sufficient. Did the I.J.'s actions in this case violate the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures?","No, the Immigration Judge's actions did not violate the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures in this case. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the petition for review, affirming the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision, which upheld the I.J.'s denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture (CAT) protection.

The Court held that the *Matter of L-A-C-* procedures for identifying specific corroborating evidence and allowing an explanation for its absence apply only when the I.J. requires ""specific corroborating evidence"" and holds one missing piece of evidence to be the *sine qua non* to corroboration. In this case, the I.J. did not impose such a requirement. Instead, the I.J. engaged in a comprehensive analysis, finding that while the applicant's testimony was credible, it was not sufficiently corroborated by the evidence provided, and that other supporting documents would have been reasonably available.

"Pardeep Kumar, a native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) denial of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), as well as the denial of his motion to remand.

The court lacked jurisdiction over several procedural claims because Kumar failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not properly raising them to the BIA or in a motion for reconsideration. For the claims over which it had jurisdiction, the court denied them:
1.  **Substantive Claims (Asylum, Withholding of Removal, CAT, BIA's factual conclusions, and denial of motion to remand):** These claims were denied because the BIA's factual findings and conclusions were supported by substantial evidence; the evidence did not compel a contrary conclusion that the harm endured amounted to persecution or torture, that the BJP was the Indian government, that the national identification system prevented relocation, or that the medical evaluation supported his claims of BJP attacks. The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to remand because the new evidence would not have changed the outcome.
2.  **Due Process Claims:** These claims were denied because Kumar failed to show substantial prejudice, as the alleged errors (discrepancy in the record, failure to advise on medical evaluation/declaration, and denial of continuance) would not have affected the outcome of the proceedings.
3.  **Meaningful Consideration Claims:** These claims were denied because the BIA's decision sufficiently reflected a meaningful consideration of the relevant evidence, referencing the testimony and affidavits Kumar alleged were mischaracterized.","[('usc', '8', '8'), ('cfr', '8', '1208.18'), ('cfr', '8', '208.13'), ('usc', '8', '1252'), ('cfr', '8', '208.18'), ('cfr', '8', '1208.16')]","['dale v holder', 'ramchandani v gonzales', 'qorane v barr', 'mikhael v ins', 'cabrera v sessions', 'morales v sessions', 'okpala v whitaker', 'chen v gonzales', 'efe v ashcroft', 'omari v holder', 'goonsuwan v ashcroft', 'kumar v garland', 'singh v whitaker', 'suate-orellana v barr', 'cardona-franco v garland', 'chun v ins', 'munoz-granados v barr', 'santos-alvarado v barr', 'eduard v ashcroft', 'khadiwal v lynch', 'mireles-valdez v ashcroft', 'martinez-lopez v barr', 'gjetani v barr', 'ins v elias-zacarias', 'roy v ashcroft', 'avelar-oliva v barr', 'abdel-masieh v ins', 'martinez-guevara v garland', 'orellana-monson v holder', 'wang v ashcroft', 'tesfamichael v gonzales', 'ogunfuye v holder']","[{'title': ('usc', '8', '1201.'), 'chunk': ""(i) Revocation of visas or documents After the issuance of a visa or other documentation to any alien, the consular officer or the Secretary of State may at any time, in his discretion, revoke such visa or other documentation Notice of such revocation shall be communicated to the Attorney General, and such revocation shall invalidate the visa or other documentation from the date of issuance: Provided, That carriers or transportation companies, and masters, commanding officers, agents, owners, charterers, or consignees, shall not be penalized under section 1323(b) of this title for action taken in reliance on such visas or other documentation, unless they received due notice of such revocation prior to the alien's embarkation There shall be no means of judicial review (including review pursuant to section 2241 of title 28 or any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title) of a revocation under this subsection, except in the context of a removal proceeding if such revocation provides the sole ground for removal under section 1227(a)(1)(B) of this title.""}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1187.'), 'chunk': ""(6) Computation of visa refusal rates For purposes of determining the eligibility of a country to be designated as a program country, the calculation of visa refusal rates shall not include any visa refusals which incorporate any procedures based on, or are otherwise based on, race, sex, or disability, unless otherwise specifically authorized by law or regulation No court shall have jurisdiction under this paragraph to review any visa refusal, the denial of admission to the United States of any alien by the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary's computation of the visa refusal rate, or the designation or nondesignation of any country""}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '6447.'), 'chunk': '(d) Sense of Congress It is the sense of Congress that— (1) ongoing and persistent waivers of the application of any of the actions described in paragraphs (9) through (15) of section 6445(a) of this title (or commensurate substitute action) with respect to a country do not fulfill the purposes of this chapter; and (2) because the promotion of religious freedom is an important interest of United States foreign policy, the President, the Secretary of State, and other executive branch officials, in consultation with Congress, should seek to find ways to address existing violations, on a case-by-case basis, through the actions described in section 6445 of this title or other commensurate substitute action.'}]","[{'title': 'ruiz-perez v garland', 'chunk': ""The court considered the case of Samuel De Jesus Argueta-Hernandez, who sought review of the Board of Immigration Appeals’ (BIA) denial of his application for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).

Consequently, the court stayed the effective date and enjoined the implementation of increased fees for: (1) Form EOIR-26 for filing an appeal from a decision of an immigration judge; (2) Form EOIR-29 for filing an appeal from a decision of an officer of the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”); (3) filing a motion to reopen or to reconsider before the BIA; (4) Form EOIR-40 for an application for suspension of deportation; (5) Form EOIR-42A for an application for cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents; and (6) Form EOIR-42B for an application for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status for certain nonpermanent residents, pending final adjudication of the action.","[('usc', '8', '1229'), ('usc', '8', '1252'), ('cfr', '8', '1103.7')]","['spann v colonial vill. inc.', 'winter v nat. res. def. council inc.', 'j.e.f.m. v lynch', 'jennings v rodriguez', 'stewart v azar', 'equal rts. ctr. v post props. inc.', 'am. socy for the prevention of cruelty to animals v feld ent. inc.', 's. poverty law ctr. v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'delgado v quarantillo', 'home box office inc. v fcc', 'martinez v napolitano', 'carpenters indus. council v zinke', 'food & water watch inc. v vilsack', 'nielsen v preap', 'natl treasury emps. union v united states', 'ayuda inc. v atty gen.', 'summers v earth island inst.', 'immigrant legal res. ctr. v wolf', 'pub. citizen inc. v faa', 'harmon v thornburgh', 'physicians for soc. resp. v wheeler', 'nw. immigrant rts. project v uscis', 'natl immigr. project of the natl lawyers guild v exec. office of immigr. review', 'sherley v sebelius', 'catholic legal immigration network inc v executive office for immigration review', 'trump v intl refugee assistance project', 'motor vehicle mfrs. assn of u.s. inc. v state farm mut. auto. ins.', 'natl mining assn v u.s. army corps of engrs', 'league of women voters of u.s. v newby', 'neb. dept of health & human servs v dept of health & human servs.', 'o.a. v trump', 'sierra club v jackson', 'nken v holder', 'michigan v epa', 'arizona v united states']","[{'title': ('usc', '6', '596'), 'chunk': '(4) Briefing and submission requirements Before making any changes to the structure or requirements of the STC program, the Assistant Secretary shall— (A) consult with the appropriate congressional committees; and (B) provide to those committees— (i) a briefing on the proposed changes, including a justification for the changes; (ii) documentation relating to the changes, including plans, strategies, and resources to implement the changes; and (iii) an assessment of the effect of the changes on the capabilities of the STC program, taking into consideration previous resource allocations and stakeholder input.'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '8515.'), 'chunk': '(d) Government Accountability Office report on effect of procurement prohibition Not later than 1 year after July 1, 2010, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees, the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives, a report assessing the extent to which executive agencies would have entered into or renewed contracts for the procurement of goods or services with persons that export sensitive technology to Iran if the prohibition under subsection (a) were not in effect.'}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1365'), 'chunk': '(5) Centralizing and streamlining correction process The President, or agency director designated by the President, shall establish a clearinghouse bureau in the Department of Homeland Security, to centralize and streamline the process through which members of the public can seek corrections to erroneous or inaccurate information contained in agency databases, which is related to immigration status, or which otherwise impedes lawful admission to the United States The process described in subparagraph (A) shall include specific time schedules for reviewing data correction requests, rendering decisions on such requests, and implementing appropriate corrective action in a timely manner'}]","[{'title': 'matter of o-f-a-s-', 'chunk': 'Matter of O-F-A-S- is an immigration case decided by the Attorney General on July 14, 2020 (28 I&N Dec. 35).

An applicant for naturalization must establish that they have been ""lawfully admitted for permanent residence."" ""Lawfully admitted"" requires compliance with substantive legal requirements, not just procedural regularity. Therefore, an alien who obtains LPR status due to a government mistake, even without fraud, is not lawfully admitted if they were not substantively entitled to that status.

The fact that the five-year statute of limitations for rescinding LPR status has run does not mean the initial entry was lawful or that the individual is eligible for naturalization; it only prevents the government from instituting rescission proceedings.

"A public interest organization submits a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to a federal agency, seeking all complaint records filed against its administrative judges. The agency responds by disclosing thousands of pages of documents, but with two types of redactions: (1) all administrative judges' names are redacted, with the agency arguing a blanket privacy interest under FOIA Exemption 6, and (2) discrete sentences or paragraphs within otherwise responsive complaint records are redacted, with the agency asserting that this information is ""non-responsive"" to the request, even if it does not fall under any FOIA exemption. The organization challenges both categories of redactions in court. How should a court rule on these challenges based on the provided case?","Based on the case ruling, the court should rule as follows:
1.  **Redaction of judges' names under Exemption 6:** The agency's categorical, across-the-board redaction of all administrative judges' names would likely be deemed inadequately justified. FOIA Exemption 6 does not categorically exempt individuals' identities, as the privacy and public interests at stake can vary depending on factors such as whether the judge is sitting or retired, the seriousness and number of complaints, and the potential for public understanding of government operations through disclosure. A more individualized inquiry, or a particularized showing for defined subgroups of judges, is required to properly balance the privacy interests against the public interest in disclosure.

"A U.S. company, ""InnovateTech Inc."", seeks to extend an H-1B visa for its foreign citizen employee, who works as a ""Lead Software Architect"" at a client site through a subcontracting arrangement. USCIS denies the extension, citing (1) a lack of sufficiently detailed, non-speculative day-to-day work assignments for the entire visa period, (2) perceived inconsistencies in the minimum degree requirements stated across different application documents (e.g., ""bachelor's degree in a computer-related field"" vs. ""bachelor's or higher degree in Information Technology or Computer Science""), and (3) insufficient evidence to prove InnovateTech has ""actual control"" over the employee's specific tasks at the client site, despite InnovateTech providing documentation confirming its exclusive right to hire, pay, fire, and supervise the employee. InnovateTech had also referenced the Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook to argue that a ""Lead Software Architect"" position typically requires a bachelor's degree in a specific specialty, but USCIS did not address this argument in its denial. Can InnovateTech successfully challenge this denial under the Administrative Procedure Act?","Yes, InnovateTech can likely successfully challenge the denial. Based on the provided court ruling, USCIS's denial would be considered arbitrary and capricious for several reasons. First, requiring detailed evidence of non-speculative day-to-day work assignments for the entire visa duration and focusing a ""searching inquiry into the specific services"" goes against established legal precedent regarding the ""specialty occupation"" requirement. Second, USCIS's failure to meaningfully consider or even mention InnovateTech's argument that the position is akin to an occupation described in the Department of Labor's Occupational Outlook Handbook, which could satisfy the specialty occupation criteria, renders the decision arbitrary and capricious. Third, USCIS's demand for evidence of ""actual control"" over the employee's work and duties beyond the ability to hire, pay, or fire, when InnovateTech has provided evidence of the legal right to control these factors, is inconsistent with regulatory language that states these factors are independently sufficient to establish an employer-employee relationship. The court would likely grant InnovateTech's motion for summary judgment and remand the case for reconsideration consistent with these principles.","[('usc', '8', '1184'), ('cfr', '8', '214.2'),

The word ""designated"" in the statute refers to an ongoing status rather than a one-time past event. The court reasoned that the Act's overall framework, the usage of ""designate"" versus ""establish,"" and the Act's purpose (to combat fraud that arose from pre-Act regional centers) support this broad interpretation. Furthermore, the court concluded that the Integrity Fund Fee is not unlawfully retroactive; it is a forward-looking, prospective fee for continued participation in the EB-5 regional-center program, not a penalty for past conduct or an imposition of new duties on already completed transactions.","[('usc', '8', '1154'), ('usc', '8', '1153')]","['united states v.', 'yellen v confederated tribes of chehalis rsrv.', 'turner v u.s. atty gen.', 'trw inc. v andrews', 'landgraf v usi film prods.', 'henson v santander consumer usa inc.', 'chevron u.s.a. inc. v nat. res. def. council inc.', 'bowen v georgetown univ. hosp.', 'eb5 holdings inc. v jaddou', 'food & drug admin. v brown & williamson tobacco corp.', 'da costa v immigr. inv. program off.', 'fla. dept of revenue v piccadilly cafeterias inc.', 'bernal v nra grp. llc', 'digital realty tr. inc. v somers', 'harris v garner', 'bostock v clayton county', 'behring regl ctr. llc v mayorkas', 'drazen v pinto', 'ardestani v ins', 'duncan v walker', 'king v burwell', 'bello v gacki', 'boroski v dyncorp intl', 'sw. airlines co. v saxon', 'rendon v u.s. atty gen.', 'loper bright enters. v raimondo', 'sunshine state regional center inc v director us citizenship and immigration services', 'graham cnty. soil & water conservation dist. v united states ex rel. wilson']","[{'title': ('usc', '22', '262'), 'chunk': '(C) In the area of forced displacement of populations— (i) the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and Asian Development Bank should maintain a listing, available to the Secretary of the Treasury, of all ongoing projects involving forced displacement of populations, including the number of people displaced and a report on the status of the implementation of their resettlement policy guidelines for each such project, and obtain agreements with borrowers to ensure that all ongoing projects involving forced displacement will be in full compliance with their resettlement policy guidelines by mid-1993; and (ii) the African Development Bank should adopt and implement policy guidelines on forced displacement similar to such guidelines of the other MDBs'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '262'), 'chunk': '(d) Global Warming Initiative The Administrator of the Agency for International Development shall instruct all Agency missions and bureaus to continue to implement all elements of the ""Global Warming Initiative"" as defined in, and which may continue under, the authorities of sections 2 533(c)(1) through (4) of Public Law 101–513 The Initiative shall continue to emphasize the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases through strategies consistent with continued economic development, such as forest conservation, end-use energy efficiency, least-cost energy planning, and renewable energy development The Administrator shall direct Agency mission directors to incorporate these strategies in their country programs'}, {'title': ('usc', '19', '2242.'), 'chunk': '(f) Special rule for actions affecting United States cultural industries (1) In general By no later than the date that is 30 days after the date on which the annual report is submitted to Congressional committees under section 2241(b) of this title, the Trade Representative shall identify any act, policy, or practice of Canada which— (A) affects cultural industries, (B) is adopted or expanded after December 17, 1992, and (C) is actionable under article 32.6 of the USMCA (as defined in section 4502 of this title)'}]","[{'title': 'garcia ramirez v us immigration and custom enforcement', 'chunk': 'SO ORDERED.

He also believes his removal proceedings were flawed due to a defective notice to appear and missing hearing transcripts. What does the law say about his situation, particularly regarding the definition of an aggravated felony and his eligibility for relief?","The court denied the petition for review in part and dismissed it in part. The court affirmed that a conviction for conspiracy to commit money laundering under 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h) involving funds exceeding $10,000 plainly constitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(D), making the individual removable. It was deemed unnecessary to address whether such a conviction also qualified under 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(U) or required proof of an overt act.
Regarding the claim for a waiver of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(h), the court dismissed this petition for lack of jurisdiction because the petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies by not raising the ""overt act"" argument concerning inadmissibility before the BIA. Additionally, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(I)(ii), which covers knowing conspirators in money laundering offenses, is not among the provisions for which waivers are available under § 1182(h).
The due process challenge concerning allegedly missing hearing transcripts was denied because the petitioner failed to demonstrate any substantial prejudice. Lastly, the argument that the immigration authorities lacked jurisdiction due to a defective notice to appear, based on *Pereira v.

Therefore, the respondent in this case is not found removable on the CIMT ground and remains statutorily eligible for cancellation of removal, with the record remanded to the Immigration Judge for discretionary review of relief.","[('usc', '8', '1229'), ('usc', '8', '1182'), ('usc', '8', '1101')]","['thompson v barr', 'united states v williams', 'choudry v state', 'mehboob v u.s. atty gen.', 'united states v fletcher', 'mathis v united states', 'lariosreyes v lynch', 'gilmour v rogerson', 'silva-trevino v holder', 'united states v daniels', 'sotnikau v lynch', 'united states v wilson', 'fajardo v u.s. atty gen.', 'united states v humphrey', 'bendel v nagle', 'ramirez v sessions', 'gonzalez-alvarado v ins', 'new york v ferber', 'united states v engle', 'atty griev. commn v greenleaf', 'jimenez-cedillo', 'morissette v united states', 'moreno v u.s. atty gen.', 'boggala v sessions', 'marciano v ins', 'people v scott', 'united states v malloy', 'people v hernandez', 'united states v banker', 'people v olsen', 'owens v state', 'jean-louis v atty gen. of u.s.', 'maxwell v state', 'castle v ins', 'prudencio v holder', 'olivas-motta v holder', 'united states v hughes']","[{'title': ('usc', '22', '7101.'), 'chunk': '(15) In the United States, the seriousness of this crime and its components is not reflected in current sentencing guidelines, resulting in weak penalties for convicted traffickers'}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '475.'), 'chunk': '(2) Leahy vetting required No member of a foreign law enforcement unit may join a Transnational Criminal Investigative Unit if the Secretary, in coordination with the Secretary of State, has credible information that such foreign law enforcement unit has committed a gross violation of human rights, consistent with the limitations set forth in section 2378d of title 22'}, {'title': ('usc', '19', '2703.'), 'chunk': '(iii) The extent to which the country provides internationally recognized worker rights, including— (iv) Whether the country has implemented its commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, as defined in section 507(6) of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C 2467(6)]'}]","[{'title': 'succession of harlan', 'chunk': ""This case, 23-60248, is regarding Astrid Dariana Lopez Orellana's appeal from the Department of Homeland Security.

"Under U.S. federal immigration law, can a former government employee of a foreign country's prison system, who received military training and monitored inmates, establish eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal based on a fear of persecution from criminal gangs, if the perceived threat stems from the nature of their former employment rather than an immutable characteristic, a protected social group, or a statutorily recognized political opinion?","The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied the petition for review, affirming the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision that the petitioner, a former employee of El Salvador's Ministry of Justice, was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal.

The court agreed that her role, which included monitoring prisoners via video, receiving military training, wearing a uniform and mask, and being identified by gangs due to her employment, meant the dangers she faced arose from the nature of her employment and domestic unrest, not from a protected ground, consistent with *Matter of Fuentes*. Furthermore, the court rejected her argument of an imputed anti-gang political opinion, noting that ""pro rule-of-law, anti-corruption, and anti-gang"" is not a recognized political opinion for asylum and that criminally-motivated actions (such as gangs seeking to exploit her work-related access and knowledge) do not constitute persecution on account of a protected ground.

The Court found this burden too high, particularly because the requests were not tailored to specific policy concerns, thus requiring the agency to process thousands of documents with no conceivable relation to the requester's stated interest (e.g., workplace emails about miscellaneous topics or health care plans). The Court also noted the risk of severe interference with the agency's IT systems due to the large data transfer.

"A manufacturing company, facing numerous charges for failing to verify employee work authorization and knowingly continuing to employ unauthorized aliens, seeks to overturn an administrative law judge's decision. The company argues that it acted in good faith by hiring a purportedly qualified HR director whose negligence led to the violations. It also claims that many violations are barred by the five-year statute of limitations. Furthermore, the company challenges the summarily imposed civil penalties, arguing that its severe financial distress (including significant net losses and pending bankruptcy) constitutes a material factual dispute regarding its ability to pay, which should have precluded summary determination of the penalty amount. How would a federal court likely rule on each of these arguments?","A federal court would likely rule as follows:
1.  **Good Faith Defense:** The court would likely reject the good faith defenses. The defense under 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(a)(3) applies only to knowing *hiring* violations, not *continuing employment* or *paperwork* violations. The defense under 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(6) is limited to *technical or procedural* failures, not substantive ones, and the HR director's failure to perform their duties would be properly imputed to the company as its agent.
2.  **Statute of Limitations (General):** The court would likely reject a generalized statute of limitations defense for most violations if it was not properly asserted with a statement of facts as required by 28 C.F.R. § 68.9(c). For paperwork violations, the five-year limitations period is measured from when the company was no longer required to retain the I-9 form (three years after hire or one year after termination, whichever is later). For continuing employment violations, it is measured from the last day of the ineligible alien's employment.
3.  **Statute of Limitations (Specific Untimely Claim):** However, the court would likely grant the petition for review as to a specific violation if the claim accrued more than five years before the administrative action was commenced (e.g., employment ended before the five-year window) and the agency itself had conceded the untimeliness. The limitations period begins when the claim first accrued, not when the penalty is administratively imposed.
4.  **Summary Determination of Penalty:** The court would likely uphold the summary determination of the penalty. While ""ability to pay"" is a factor that an ALJ may consider at their discretion, it is not one of the five mandatory factors listed in 8 U.S.C. § 1324a(e)(5). Because it is within the ALJ's power to decline to consider this factor at all, the company's ability to pay is not considered a *material* issue of fact that would preclude summary determination of the penalty amount. The ALJ's decision to proceed despite ambiguities in financial evidence would be considered an implicit choice to give that factor no weight, and this does not warrant reversal. The court would also typically uphold the ALJ's consideration of the statutory factors (size of business, good faith, seriousness of violations, whether the employee is an unauthorized alien, and history of previous violations) if the penalty falls within the prescribed monetary range and is reasonably based on the evidence presented.","[('cfr', '8', '274'), ('usc', '8', '1324')]","['cts corp. v waldburger', 'sec v mohn', 'united states v.', 'getahun v o.c.a.h.o.', 'united states. v snack attack deli inc.', 'bosma v u.s. dept of agric.', 'united states v meyer', 'ketchikan drywall servs. inc. v immigration & customs enft', 'united states v dominguez', 'dls precision fab llc v us immigration & customs enforcement', 'federal election commission v williams', 'united states v deleon valenzuela', 'united states v primera enters. inc.', 'united states v m.t.s. serv. corp.', 'united states v romans racing stables inc.', 'order of r.r. telegraphers v ry. express agency inc.', 'anderson v liberty lobby inc.', 'united states v curran engg co.']","[{'title': ('usc', '22', '262'), 'chunk': '(c) Project proposals relating to mining, smelting, refining, and fabricating of minerals and metal products More specifically, the following criteria should be considered as a basis for a vote by the respective United States Executive Director to each of the international financial institutions described in subsection (d) against a project proposal involving the creation of new capacity or the expansion, improvement, or modification of mining, smelting, refining, and fabricating of minerals and metal products: (1) Analysis shows that the risks, returns, and incentives of a project are such that it could be financed at reasonable terms by commercial lending services'}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '466.'), 'chunk': '(5) Existing laws, including chapter 13 of title 10 (commonly known as the ""Insurrection Act""), and the Robert T Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C 5121 et seq.), grant the President broad powers that may be invoked in the event of domestic emergencies, including an attack against the Nation using weapons of mass destruction, and these laws specifically authorize the President to use the Armed Forces to help restore public order'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '9671.'), 'chunk': '(2) Required contract language The Corporation shall also include the following language, in substantially the following form, in all contracts which the Corporation enters into with persons receiving support under subchapter II of this chapter: ""The person receiving support agrees not to take actions to prevent employees of the foreign enterprise from lawfully exercising their right of association and their right to organize and bargain collectively The person further agrees to observe applicable laws relating to a minimum age for employment of children, acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational health and safety, and not to use forced labor or the worst forms of child labor (as defined in section 507 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C 2467)) The person is not responsible under this paragraph for the actions of a foreign government.""'}]","[{'title': 'garcia ramirez v us immigration and custom enforcement', 'chunk': 'SO ORDERED.

"Under U.S. federal law, can an individual asylum seeker successfully sue federal officials in their individual capacities for money damages based on constitutional violations stemming from a family separation policy, or obtain declaratory and injunctive relief against such policies from federal agencies and officials in their official capacities, after being reunited with their child and the policy being altered and enjoined?","The court would dismiss claims against federal officials in their individual capacities for money damages. These claims require the expansion of *Bivens* remedies to a new context, which is a ""disfavored judicial activity."" ""Special factors counseling hesitation"" preclude such expansion, including that *Bivens* suits are not the appropriate mechanism to challenge general government policies, alternative methods of relief (such as class actions or official capacity suits for injunctions) are available, and the claims challenge powers subject to extensive Congressional action, particularly in immigration matters.

Claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against federal agencies and officials in their official capacities would be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to mootness. Such claims become moot when the plaintiff has been reunited with their child, has passed a credible fear interview, has been released from detention, and the challenged policy has been changed by Executive Order and enjoined nationwide by a separate class action lawsuit.

"A group of international students, who were unknowingly enrolled in a sham university created by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as part of a sting operation, received letters terminating their F-1 nonimmigrant student status due to ""fraudulent enrollment."" They filed a class action lawsuit challenging this termination under the Administrative Procedure Act, alleging due process violations, and seeking an order preventing the government from deeming their enrollment fraudulent. The District Court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that the termination was not a final agency action and the case was not ripe for review because reinstatement proceedings were pending or removal proceedings could provide administrative relief.

Unlike asylum terminations, the F-1 termination was the culmination, not the initiation, of the agency's decision-making process. Furthermore, the students are not required to wait for removal proceedings to be instituted, as such proceedings may never occur, and immigration judges and the Board of Immigration Appeals lack the authority to review USCIS's discretionary denial of reinstatement. The case is also ripe for review because the parties are in a sufficiently adversarial posture, the students are genuinely aggrieved by the termination of their lawful status and the notation of fraud on their records, and the government's inconsistent position on the students' culpability underscores the need for judicial review that would otherwise be unavailable.","[('usc', '8', '1227'), ('cfr', '8', '208.14'), ('cfr', '8', '214.1'), ('cfr', '8', '214.3'), ('cfr', '8', '214.4'), ('usc', '8', '1201'), ('cfr', '8', '214.2'), ('cfr', '8', '212'), ('usc', '8', '1101')]","['palakovic v wetzel', 'ghorbani v ins', 'peachlum v city of york', 'kashani v nelson', 'hosseini v johnson', 'ftc v standard oil co. of cal.', 'bennett v spear', 'qureshi v holder', 'pinho v gonzales', 'felmeister v office of attorney ethics', 'cabaccang v uscis', 'tooloee v ins', 'marathon petroleum corp. v secy of finance', 'babbitt v united farm workers natl union', 'young dong kim v holder', 'darby v cisneros', 'jie fang v dir us immigration & customs enforcement']","[{'title': ('usc', '8', '1226.'), 'chunk': '(a) Arrest, detention, and release On a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States Except as provided in subsection (c) and pending such decision, the Attorney General— (1) may continue to detain the arrested alien; and (2) may release the alien on— (A) bond of at least $1,500 with security approved by, and containing conditions prescribed by, the Attorney General; or (B) conditional parole; but (3) may not provide the alien with work authorization (including an ""employment authorized"" endorsement or other appropriate work permit), unless the alien is lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise would (without regard to removal proceedings) be provided such authorization'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '5821.'), 'chunk': '(c) Additional policy guidance To the maximum extent possible, and consistent with the particular purposes of the specific types of centers, the President should direct that— (1) the American Business Centers established pursuant to this section place special emphasis on assistance to United States small- and medium-sized businesses to facilitate their entry into the commercial markets of the independent states; (2) such centers offer office space, business facilities, and market analysis services to United States firms, trade associations, and State economic development offices on a user-fee basis that minimizes the cost of operating such centers; (3) such centers serve as a repository for commercial, legal, and technical information, including environmental and export control information; (4) such centers identify existing or potential counterpart businesses or organizations that may require specific technical coordination or assistance; (5) such centers be established in several sites in the independent states; and (6) host countries be asked to make appropriate contributions of real estate and personnel for the establishment and operation of such centers'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '6447.'), 'chunk': '(d) Sense of Congress It is the sense of Congress that— (1) ongoing and persistent waivers of the application of any of the actions described in paragraphs (9) through (15) of section 6445(a) of this title (or commensurate substitute action) with respect to a country do not fulfill the purposes of this chapter; and (2) because the promotion of religious freedom is an important interest of United States foreign policy, the President, the Secretary of State, and other executive branch officials, in consultation with Congress, should seek to find ways to address existing violations, on a case-by-case basis, through the actions described in section 6445 of this title or other commensurate substitute action.'}]","[{'title': 'aguilar-mendez', 'chunk': 'The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s request for voluntary departure.

"A Ukrainian national, paroled into the U.S. in 2022, brought an Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claim against USCIS for unlawfully charging a $410 filing fee for employment authorization. The plaintiff argued that the Ukrainian Parolee Act entitled her to fee exemption, and the court agreed that her claim for a refund was not barred by sovereign immunity under the APA. Despite this, the court still dismissed the APA claim. What was the court's reasoning for dismissing the APA claim, and what alternative remedy did it identify as adequate?","The court dismissed the plaintiff's APA claim because she had an ""adequate remedy"" at law, which is an element of an APA cause of action under 5 U.S.C. § 704. The court found that a Tucker Act suit in the Court of Federal Claims or a Little Tucker Act suit in a federal district court would provide an adequate alternative remedy. These alternatives could offer the monetary relief (a refund) that the plaintiff sought and allow for review of the challenged agency action to the same extent as an APA case. The court reasoned that a monetary award would necessarily be predicated on a finding of legal error by the agency, effectively forcing the agency to cease its unlawful practice, making these alternatives adequate even if they didn't explicitly provide declaratory relief.","[('cfr', '8', '274'), ('cfr', '8', '106.2'), ('usc', '8', '1157')]","['astakhov v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'bell atl. corp. v twombly', 'bowen v massachusetts', 'united states v.', 'lujan v defs. of wildlife', 'scheuer v rhodes', 'perry capital llc v mnuchin', 'garcia v vilsack', 'bagherian v pompeo', 'ashcroft v iqbal', 'didban v pompeo', 'am. natl ins. v fdic']","[{'title': ('usc', '19', '1499.'), 'chunk': '(2) Appeal of adverse accreditation decisions A laboratory applying for accreditation, or that is accredited, under this section may contest any decision or order of the Customs Service denying, suspending, or revoking accreditation, or imposing a monetary penalty, by commencing an action in accordance with chapter 169 of title 28 in the Court of International Trade within 60 days after issuance of the decision or order'}, {'title': ('usc', '19', '1553'), 'chunk': 'Merchandise in Customs 1 custody that is transported by pipeline may be accounted for on a quantitative basis, based on the bill of lading, or equivalent document of receipt, issued by the pipeline carrier Unless the Customs Service has reasonable cause to suspect fraud, the Customs Service may accept the bill of lading, or equivalent document of receipt, issued by the pipeline carrier to the shipper and accepted by the consignee to maintain identity The shipper, pipeline operator, and consignee shall be subject to the recordkeeping requirements of sections 1508 and 1509 of this title.'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '8515.'), 'chunk': '(d) Government Accountability Office report on effect of procurement prohibition Not later than 1 year after July 1, 2010, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees, the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives, a report assessing the extent to which executive agencies would have entered into or renewed contracts for the procurement of goods or services with persons that export sensitive technology to Iran if the prohibition under subsection (a) were not in effect.'}]","[{'title': 'munoz-de zelaya v garland', 'chunk': 'The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the petition for review in the immigration case Munoz-De Zelaya v.

"Can a noncitizen residing outside the U.S. successfully sue the government for unreasonable delay in processing a worker's visa application, citing violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause, when the delay is primarily attributed to a global pandemic and the applicant seeks initial entry?","No. The court dismissed the claims, finding that some defendants (USCIS, its Director, and the Secretary of State) were moot because they lacked the authority to provide the requested relief. Regarding the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claim, the court determined that an eighteen-month (or even two-year) delay in scheduling a visa interview was not unreasonable as a matter of law, especially given the ""substantial backlogs"" caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the government's efforts to protect public health. Applying the TRAC factors, the court noted that Congress sets no statutory deadline for visa processing, the prejudice alleged was primarily financial rather than health-related, and expediting the applicant's case would merely reorder the queue without net gain. Concerning the Due Process claim, the court held that a noncitizen seeking initial admission to the United States has no constitutional rights under the Due Process Clause regarding their application, as the power to admit or exclude noncitizens is a sovereign prerogative and their only procedural rights are those conferred by statute.","[('usc', '8', '1202'), ('usc', '8', '8')]","['sparrow v united air lines inc.', 'palakuru v renaud', 'mashpee wampanoag tribal council inc. v norton', 'bagherian v pompeo', 'shaughnessy v united states ex rel. mezei', 'baan rao thai rest. v pompeo', 'new vision photography program inc. v district of columbia', 'iron arrow honor socy v heckler', 'ghadami v dept of homeland sec.', 'united states ex rel. knauff v shaughnessy', 'nishimura ekiu v united states', 'conservation force inc. v jewell', 'scheuer v rhodes', 'dept of homeland sec. v thuraissigiam', 'dastagir v blinken', 'tate v pompeo', 'skalka v kelly', 'ashcroft v iqbal', 'khanom v kerry', 'sarlak v pompeo', 'khushnood v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'hulli v mayorkas', 'landon v plasencia', 'oil chemical and atomic workers intern. union v zegeer', 'kowal v mci commcns corp.', 'legal assistance for vietnamese asylum seekers v dept of state']","[{'title': ('usc', '6', '242'), 'chunk': ""(b) Report to Congress Not later than 1 year after December 27, 2022, the CCHT Director shall submit a report to Congress that identifies any legislation that is needed to facilitate the Department of Homeland Security's mission to end human trafficking""}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1188.'), 'chunk': '(d) Roles of agricultural associations (1) Permitting filing by agricultural associations A petition to import an alien as a temporary agricultural worker, and an application for a labor certification with respect to such a worker, may be filed by an association of agricultural producers which use agricultural services'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '6040.'), 'chunk': '(d) Assurances regarding sugar products Protection of essential security interests of the United States requires assurances that sugar products that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, into the customs territory of the United States are not products of Cuba.'}]","[{'title': 'cameron v thornburgh', 'chunk': ""The court case PSV ENTERPRISES, LLC v.

"Under what circumstances will a U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia transfer a case challenging a USCIS visa denial to another district, particularly when the plaintiff chose the D.C. forum but the administrative decision was made elsewhere?","A U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia will transfer a case challenging a USCIS visa denial to another district, such as the District of Nebraska, when the balance of private and public interest factors strongly favors the transferee forum. In such cases, the court will grant a motion to transfer pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), concluding that the case ""might have been brought"" in the transferee court and that transfer is ""in the interest of justice.""

Specifically, the court considers:
1.  **Propriety of Venue in Transferee Court:** Venue is proper in the transferee court if, under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e), a defendant resides there, a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred there, or the plaintiff resides there. For cases challenging USCIS decisions, venue is typically proper in the district where the relevant service center (e.g., Nebraska Service Center) is located and processed the petition, or where the plaintiff resides.
2.  **Balancing of Private Interest Factors:**
    *   **Plaintiff's Choice of Forum:** The deference given to the plaintiff's choice of forum is significantly reduced when it is not the plaintiff's home forum and lacks meaningful ties to the controversy. If the administrative decision being challenged was made in another district, the D.C. court will give ""nadir"" deference to the plaintiff's choice to sue in D.C.
    *   **Defendant's Choice of Forum:** This choice gains some deference, especially when the defendants seek transfer to the plaintiff's home forum or where the claim arose.
    *   **Where the Claim Arose:** This is a predominant factor. In Administrative Procedure Act (APA) cases challenging agency action, the claim generally arises where the decision-making process occurred. If the visa petition was processed, adjudicated, and denied by a USCIS service center in another district (e.g., Nebraska), then the claim arose in that district, not D.C., even if general agency policies were formulated in D.C., unless there are credible allegations of direct, case-specific involvement by D.C.-based officials.
    *   **Convenience of Parties, Witnesses, and Access to Proof:** Convenience factors typically favor the district where the plaintiff resides (if applicable) or, more strongly, the district where the administrative record is located and where the agency personnel involved in the challenged decision reside, as APA cases are generally resolved on the administrative record.
3.  **Balancing of Public Interest Factors:**
    *   **Familiarity with Governing Laws:** This factor is neutral for federal law cases as all federal courts are presumed equally familiar.
    *   **Relative Congestion of Calendars:** While current statistics might slightly favor D.C. in terms of caseload, this factor is often a ""wash"" due to the difficulty of accurate assessment and the concern about future congestion if D.C. retains cases with little connection to the district.
    *   **Local Interest in Resolving the Controversy:** This is the ""most important"" public factor. The district where the challenged decision was made (e.g., Nebraska Service Center) has the strongest local interest, especially if the relief sought involves compelling specific actions in that district. A case challenging a single visa petition's denial is typically not considered one of ""national significance.""

In sum, the court will transfer the case to the district where the administrative decision was made and where the bulk of the administrative record and relevant agency personnel are located, finding it to be the optimal venue when D.C. lacks meaningful ties to the specific controversy.","[('cfr', '8', '103.2'), ('cfr', '8', '204.5'), ('usc', '8', '1153')]","['united states v.', 'ngonga v sessions', 'wolfram alpha llc v cuccinelli', 'cameron v thornburgh', 'lamont v haig', 'stewart v azar', 'fed. hous. fin. agency v first tenn. bank natl assn', 'huskey v quinlan', 'pengbo li v miller no.', 'pasem v uscis', 'efficientip inc. v cuccinelli no.', 'stewart org. inc. v ricoh corp.', 'trout unlimited v u.s. dept of agric.', 'bahena v renaud', 'aishat v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'abusadeh v chertoff no.', 'aftab v gonzalez', 'bourdon v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'melnattur v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'gyau v sessions', 'greater yellowstone coal. v bosworth', 'ike v uscis', 'norton v s. utah wilderness all.', 'aracely v nielsen']","[{'title': ('usc', '19', '1305.'), 'chunk': '(c) 1 Stay on motion Upon motion of the United States, a court, for good cause shown, shall stay civil forfeiture proceedings commenced under this section pending the completion of any related criminal matter whether in the same or in a different district.'}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '1113.'), 'chunk': '(3) Limitation on Secretary The Secretary shall not initiate civil enforcement actions for violations of administrative and procedural requirements pertaining to the application for, and expenditure of, funds awarded under transportation security grant programs under this Act'}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '1181.'), 'chunk': '(k) Shared facilities The Secretary may permit under this section the development and implementation of coordinated vulnerability assessments and security plans to the extent that an over-the-road bus operator shares facilities with, or is colocated with, other transportation entities or providers that are required to develop vulnerability assessments and security plans under Federal law'}]","[{'title': 'friends of animals v u.s. bureau of land mgmt.', 'chunk': 'Friends of Animals v.

"Apex Construction Inc. hired several new employees. For some, the employees signed Section 1 of the I-9 Form but failed to check the box indicating their specific work authorization status (e.g., U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident). For others, Apex completed Section 2 but failed to list the issuing authority for a driver's license presented as proof of identity. Apex had photocopied all identity and work authorization documents and kept them in a separate folder, believing that the copies, combined with the employee's signature, fulfilled its obligations. During an ICE inspection, these issues were flagged. Apex later produced the copied documents during the administrative hearing, arguing they cured the I-9 deficiencies and showed good faith. Apex now faces civil penalties. Based on the *Ketchikan Drywall Services* decision, how should a court evaluate Apex Construction Inc.'s arguments regarding its I-9 compliance, the nature of its violations, and the potential for penalty mitigation?","Based on the *Ketchikan Drywall Services* decision, Apex Construction Inc.'s arguments would likely be rejected, and the penalties upheld. The court would find that employers must fully complete I-9 Forms, and merely copying and retaining verification documents is neither necessary nor sufficient for compliance, nor does it relieve the employer of the requirement to fully complete Section 2. The regulation, 8 C.F.R. § 274a.2(b)(3), clarifies that copying and retention do not relieve the employer from fully completing Section 2, superseding any prior interpretations to the contrary.

Regarding the specific violations:
1.  **Failure to check a specific box in Section 1:** This is considered a ""substantive"" verification failure under the Virtue Memorandum (which the court grants Skidmore deference). Employees are required to attest to a specific category of eligibility, and failure to check the appropriate box means the statutory requirement (8 U.S.C. § 1324a(b)(2)) is unfulfilled, regardless of whether other documentation might allow ICE to deduce the employee's status. Employers are responsible for ensuring Section 1 is completely filled out by employees.
2.  **Failure to list the issuing authority for a List B document (e.g., driver's license) in Section 2:** This is a substantive failure. Employers have an obligation to fill out Section 2 of their I-9 Forms ""fully,"" and the absence of the issuing authority constitutes a failure to identify the document utilized, even if ICE might deduce the information from other details.

The court would likely find that the late production of copied documents during the administrative hearing cannot cure substantive deficiencies. The Virtue Memorandum only excuses certain substantive deficiencies where the missing information is found ""on a legible copy of a document retained *with* the Form I-9 and *presented at the I-9 inspection*."" Documents not presented at the initial I-9 inspection do not qualify. The penalties are imposed for substantive deficiencies on the I-9 Forms themselves, not for the manner or timing of document storage or production.

Finally, concerning penalty mitigation, the ALJ has broad discretion. A refusal to mitigate for ""good faith"" would be permissible if, for example, Apex had a history of non-compliance or demonstrated a lack of timely effort to ascertain and conform to the law. Similarly, a refusal to mitigate for ""non-seriousness"" would be upheld, as the penalties are for substantive deficiencies in the I-9 Forms.","[('cfr', '8', '274'), ('usc', '8', '8'), ('usc', '8', '1324')]","['united states v mead corp.', 'united states v wsc plumbing inc.', 'montero-martinez v ashcroft', 'bosma v u.s. dept of agric.', 'balice v u.s. dept of agric.', 'ketchikan drywall services inc v immigration & customs enforcement', 'united states v pegasus rest. inc.', 'united states v manos & assocs. inc.', 'judulang v holder', 'christensen v harris county', 'united states v j.j.l.c. inc. ta richfield caterers', 'united states v carter', 'united states v candlelight inn', 'skidmore v swift & co.', 'eeoc v first citizens bank of billings']","[{'title': ('usc', '19', '4532.'), 'chunk': ""(4) Alternative staging regime review and modification If the request of a producer to use the alternative staging regime for more than 10 percent of the total production of passenger vehicles or light trucks, as the case may be, in USMCA countries by the producer has been granted, the producer shall notify the Trade Representative and the interagency committee of any material changes to the information contained in the request, including any supplemental information relating to that request, and of any material changes to circumstances, that will affect the producer's ability to meet any of the requirements set forth in articles 2 through 7 of the automotive appendix after the alternative staging regime period has expired If the Trade Representative, in consultation with the interagency committee, determines that the information provided by a producer under clause (i) demonstrates that the producer will no longer be able to meet the requirements set forth in articles 2 through 7 of the automotive appendix after the alternative staging regime period has expired, the Trade Representative shall notify the producer in writing, and no claim for preferential tariff treatment may be made, on or after the date of the determination, with respect to a covered vehicle of the producer pursuant to the alternative staging regime""}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '1203.'), 'chunk': '(b) Route plans (1) Assessment Not later than 1 year after August 3, 2007, the Secretary of Transportation shall complete an assessment of the safety and national security benefits achieved under existing requirements for route plans, in written or electronic format, for explosives and radioactive materials The assessment shall, at a minimum— (A) compare the percentage of Department of Transportation recordable incidents and the severity of such incidents for shipments of explosives and radioactive materials for which such route plans are required with the percentage of recordable incidents and the severity of such incidents for shipments of explosives and radioactive materials not subject to such route plans; and (B) quantify the security and safety benefits, feasibility, and costs of requiring each motor carrier that is required to have a hazardous material safety permit under part 385 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, to maintain, follow, and carry such a route plan that meets the requirements of section 397.101 of that title when transporting the type and quantity of hazardous materials described in section 385.403, taking into account the various segments of the motor carrier industry, including tank truck, truckload and less than truckload carriers'}, {'title': ('usc', '19', '1415.'), 'chunk': '(II) If the requirements of subclause (I) are not met, the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees, not later than June 30, 2019, a report— (aa) assessing the reasons for the failure to meet those requirements; and (bb) identifying recommendations to improve the collection by the Postal Service of the information described in paragraphs (1) and (2) (vi)(I) Notwithstanding clause (iv), the Postal Service shall, not later than December 31, 2020, arrange for the transmission to the Commissioner of the information described in paragraphs (1) and (2) for 100 percent of the aggregate number of mail shipments described in clause (i)'}]","[{'title': 'mckenzie v us citizenship & immigration services', 'chunk': '50475, 50496 (Oct. 7, 1991).

"A nurse from a war-torn region claims asylum, alleging past persecution based on an imputed political opinion (assisting separatists) and Anglophone ethnicity, supported by credible testimony of repeated arrests, beatings, credible death threats, and the disappearance of fellow detainees. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denies relief, finding no past persecution because the injuries were not ""extreme,"" no nexus to a protected ground (as the military targeted him due to his occupation as a nurse, not political opinion), and insufficient corroborating evidence (lack of photos/medical records) despite the nurse's explanation for their absence and submission of affidavits.

Her EAD has expired due to USCIS processing delays, causing her to lose her job and driver's license. She seeks a preliminary injunction to compel USCIS to immediately adjudicate her applications.

The court found that USCIS's delay in adjudicating her applications was not sufficiently unreasonable *at present*. Applying the *TRAC* factors:
1.  **Rule of Reason:** USCIS's ""first-in, first-out"" processing system was considered a rule of reason, favoring defendants.
2.  **Congressional Timetable:** While 8 U.S.C. § 1571(b) suggests processing within 180 days (six months), the plaintiff's applications had been pending for less than four months when the decision was made, so this factor favored defendants *for the moment*.
3.  **Human Health and Welfare / Interests Prejudiced:** These factors favored the plaintiff, acknowledging the significant hardship beyond mere economic harm, including loss of employment, inability to drive, and potential impact on her new restaurant's employees, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
4.  **Effect on Competing Priorities:** This factor favored defendants. Granting relief would place the plaintiff ahead of other similarly situated applicants facing delays due to USCIS backlogs in biometrics scheduling, merely reordering the queue without addressing the systemic issue.
Considering these factors as a whole, the court concluded that the rule of reason, the fact that the six-month congressional window had not yet elapsed, and the concern about reordering the queue outweighed the substantial hardships to the plaintiff, meaning the delay was not yet ""so egregious as to warrant mandamus"" or APA relief.","[('usc', '8', '1571'), ('cfr', '8', '106.4'), ('usc', '8', '1184'), ('cfr', '8', '274'), ('cfr', '8', '8'), ('cfr', '8', '103.2'), ('usc', '8', '1101')]","['winter v nat. res. def. council inc.', 'gonzales v cissna', 'natl assn of mfrs. v sec', 'gonzales v o centro espirita beneficente união do vegetal', 'univ. of tex. v camenisch', 'mashpee wampanoag tribal council inc. v norton', 'nibber v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'emergency coal. to defend educ. travel v dept of treasury', 'islam v heinauer', 'davis v pension benefit guar. corp.', 'pursuing am.s greatness v fec', 'singh v carter', 'a.c.c.s. v nielsen', 'archdiocese of wash. v wash. metro. area. transit auth.', 'ray v cuccinelli', 'munaf v geren', 'uranga v u.s. citizenship & immigr. servs.', 'sherley v sebelius', 'khan v johnson', 'konchitsky v chertoff', 'league of women voters of u.s. v newby', 'norton v s. utah wilderness all.', 'am. hosp. assn v burwell', 'liberty fund inc. v chao', 'mazurek v armstrong', 'aamer v obama', 'muvvala v wolf']","[{'title': ('usc', '6', '278.'), 'chunk': '(a) Establishment of tracking system The Secretary, not later than 1 year after the effective date of this chapter, in consultation with the Technology Advisory Committee established under subsection (c), shall establish an Internet-based system, that will permit a person, employer, immigrant, or nonimmigrant who has filings with the Secretary for any benefit under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C 1101 et seq.), access to online information about the processing status of the filing involved'}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1365'), 'chunk': '(5) Centralizing and streamlining correction process The President, or agency director designated by the President, shall establish a clearinghouse bureau in the Department of Homeland Security, to centralize and streamline the process through which members of the public can seek corrections to erroneous or inaccurate information contained in agency databases, which is related to immigration status, or which otherwise impedes lawful admission to the United States The process described in subparagraph (A) shall include specific time schedules for reviewing data correction requests, rendering decisions on such requests, and implementing appropriate corrective action in a timely manner'}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1187.'), 'chunk': '(11) Eligibility determination under the electronic system for travel authorization Beginning on the date on which the electronic system for travel authorization developed under subsection (h)(3) is fully operational, each alien traveling under the program shall, before applying for admission to the United States, electronically provide to the system biographical information and such other information as the Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine necessary to determine the eligibility of, and whether there exists a law enforcement or security risk in permitting, the alien to travel to the United States Upon review of such biographical information, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine whether the alien is eligible to travel to the United States under the program'}]","[{'title': 'argueta-hernandez v garland', 'chunk': 'In denying Argueta-Hernandez’s claims, the BIA explained that he received only verbal threats and did not suffer any physical harm.

"Must U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) consider placement in the least restrictive setting available, including alternative detention programs, for all unaccompanied alien children who turn 18 and are transferred to DHS custody, regardless of their perceived flight risk or current immigration procedural status, and can a class action be certified to challenge a systematic failure to do so?","Yes, the court ruled that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have a non-discretionary statutory duty to consider placement in the least restrictive setting available, including alternative to detention programs, for all former unaccompanied alien children who turn 18 and are transferred to DHS custody.

"If a Mexican citizen, who publicly campaigned against the Mexican Navy following the disappearance of her son, had her vacant home ransacked and observed Navy vehicles drive by her house once, but experienced no direct threats or further incidents, would she and her minor children be entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention Against Torture in the U.S. based on past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution?","No, the petitioners would not be entitled to asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention Against Torture.
The court denied the petition for review, affirming the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) decision.

1.  **Asylum:**
    *   **Past Persecution:** The BIA did not err in finding no past persecution. The ransacking of the vacant home was a singular event that did not cause serious or permanent damage and was more akin to ""abusive or harassing treatment"" than ""extreme conduct"" required for persecution. The incidents (ransacking and Navy vehicles driving by) did not create a threat sufficiently menacing or imminent to amount to persecution. Rangel had publicly campaigned against the Navy for four months without physical harm or direct threats, and the alleged threat lacked the ""organized, relentless campaign of intimidation"" found in cases compelling a finding of persecution.
    *   **Well-Founded Fear of Future Persecution:** The BIA did not err. Petitioners failed to establish past persecution, thus were not entitled to a rebuttable presumption of a well-founded fear. Rangel had publicly campaigned against the Navy for four months without suffering physical harm, threats, or reprisals until the ransacking, and no further threats took place after that incident. There was no indication the Navy remained interested in or actively searching for petitioners, and the disappearance of Rangel's other son was determined to be unrelated to her campaigning.

2.  **Withholding of Removal:** The BIA did not err. Withholding of removal is a higher standard than asylum. Since petitioners failed to demonstrate they suffered past persecution or had a well-founded fear of future persecution for asylum, they necessarily failed to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.

3.  **Convention Against Torture (CAT) Relief:** The BIA did not err. Torture is a higher bar than persecution. Since the basis for relief advanced by petitioners did not even rise to the level of persecution, it follows a fortiori that it does not constitute torture. Additionally, the minor children's claims, based entirely on Rangel's experiences, independently failed as they would not be personally at risk of torture.","[('usc', '8', '1158'), ('cfr', '8', '1208.13'), ('cfr', '8', '208.16'), ('usc', '8', '1252'), ('cfr', '8', '208.18'), ('cfr', '8', '1208.16'), ('usc', '8', '1101')]","['liu v ashcroft', 'guillen cedio v garland', 'arif v mukasey', 'mejia-alvarenga v garland', 'qorane v barr', 'cabrera v sessions', 'maraziegos-morales v garland', 'majd v gonzales', 'morales v sessions', 'efe v ashcroft', 'zho v gonzales', 'escobar-chavez v i.n.s.', 'zhao v gonzales', 'munoz-granados v barr', 'eduard v ashcroft', 'guevara flores v ins', 'gjetani v barr', 'loredo rangel v garland', 'abdel-masieh v ins', 'argueta-hernandez v garland', 'ghotra v whitaker', 'alvarado-molina v i.n.s.', 'dayo v holder', 'evelyne v keisler', 'tesfamichael v gonzales', 'villavicencio-castillo v i.n.s.']","[{'title': ('usc', '22', '8722.'), 'chunk': '(3) Termination period The President is authorized not to impose sanctions under subsection (a) with respect to a person if the President receives reliable assurances that the person will terminate the provision of underwriting services or insurance or reinsurance for the National Iranian Oil Company, the National Iranian Tanker Company, and any successor entity to either such company, not later than the date that is 120 days after August 10, 2012'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '9753.'), 'chunk': '(2) Threat assessment Not later than 120 days after December 20, 2019, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to the appropriate congressional committees regarding— (A) an assessment of Russian-Venezuelan security cooperation; (B) the potential threat such cooperation poses to the United States and countries in the Western Hemisphere; and (C) a strategy to counter threats identified in subparagraphs (A) and (B)'}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1254'), 'chunk': '(4) Treatment of brief, casual, and innocent departures and certain other absences (A) For purposes of paragraphs (1)(A)(i) and (3)(B), an alien shall not be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical presence in the United States by virtue of brief, casual, and innocent absences from the United States, without regard to whether such absences were authorized by the Attorney General'}]","[{'title': 'judicial watch, inc. v food & drug admin.', 'chunk': ""The court case involves Nelson Mezerhane Gosen, a former Venezuelan television executive, against U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

"Can a U.S. federal district court compel the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to adjudicate an alien's 35-year-old application for lawful permanent resident status under the laws and facts as they existed at the time of the original filing, specifically to enable the alien to seek a deportation waiver that was subsequently repealed, given the alien's intervening criminal conviction and fraudulent conduct?","No, a U.S. federal district court cannot compel such adjudication under these circumstances. The court ruled against Armando Garcia on both his claims. For his Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) claim, the court granted summary judgment to USCIS, concluding that USCIS had adequately searched for a record of any adjudication of his 1981 application, albeit unsuccessfully. For his claim seeking reconsideration and adjudication of his 1981 lawful permanent resident (LPR) request under the facts and law as they stood in 1981, the court granted Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. The court determined that Garcia lacked standing because his theory of relief was too speculative and spectral, requiring extraordinary *nunc pro tunc* equitable remedies. The court doubted its authority to grant such extensive *nunc pro tunc* relief, which would entail ignoring subsequent criminal convictions and changes in immigration laws, and found it unwarranted on equitable grounds due to Garcia's fraudulent behavior and delays.

"An individual, Mr. Rodriguez, is a long-time lawful permanent resident of the U.S. who has a final order of removal. After the initial 90-day statutory removal period, he is detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for an additional 10 months. During this prolonged detention, he alleges that federal immigration officials, knowing that his removal to his home country was not possible and that he was ineligible for removal to a third country, made false statements in official documents to justify his continued detention. Mr. Rodriguez seeks monetary damages against these federal officials under a *Bivens* action, claiming violations of his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights for unreasonable seizure and prolonged detention without due process. Can Mr. Rodriguez pursue a *Bivens* action for damages against the federal immigration officials under these circumstances?","No, Mr. Rodriguez cannot pursue a *Bivens* action for damages against the federal immigration officials for unconstitutionally prolonged detention under these circumstances, although federal courts do have subject matter jurisdiction to hear such a claim.

The court finds that claims challenging prolonged detention after the 90-day removal period, based on allegations that officials knew removal was impossible and prolonged detention for other reasons, do not ""arise from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders"" under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). Therefore, this specific type of claim is not barred by that jurisdictional statute.

However, the court holds that no *Bivens* remedy is available. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) is considered an ""elaborate remedial system"" that provides ""sufficient meaningful remedies"" for aliens, including numerous administrative review procedures and the availability of a writ of habeas corpus to challenge detention. Congress's frequent amendments to the INA without providing a damages remedy suggests a deliberate omission. The absence of monetary relief within this statutory scheme is not a sufficient reason to create a new *Bivens* remedy. Additionally, several ""special factors"" counsel against extending *Bivens* into this context: the breadth and detail of the INA itself, the importance of demonstrating due respect for the Constitution's separation of powers (Congress's power over naturalization and the Executive's role in foreign relations), and the doctrinal novelty and administrative difficulty of such a claim, which could lead to widespread litigation and potentially chill robust enforcement of immigration laws.","[('usc', '8', '1231'), ('usc', '8', '1229'), ('cfr', '8', '241.14'), ('usc', '8', '1225'), ('cfr', '8', '241.4'), ('usc', '8', '1252'), ('cfr', '8', '241.13'), ('usc', '8', '1228')]","['demore v kim', 'webster v doe', 'united states v.', 'de la paz v coy', 'zadvydas v davis', 'mirmehdi v united states', 'doe', 'alvarez v holder', 'bivens v six unknown named agents of federal bureau of narcotics', 'gupta v mcgahey', 'lincoln v vigil', 'garcia uranga v us citizenship & immigration services', 'santiago alvarez v us immigration and customs enforcement', 'ashcroft v iqbal', 'spencer v kemna', 'davis v passman', 'wilkie v robbins', 'heck v humphrey', 'reno v flores', 'carlson v green', 'minneci v pollard', 'arizona v united states']","[{'title': ('usc', '8', '1226.'), 'chunk': '(a) Arrest, detention, and release On a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States Except as provided in subsection (c) and pending such decision, the Attorney General— (1) may continue to detain the arrested alien; and (2) may release the alien on— (A) bond of at least $1,500 with security approved by, and containing conditions prescribed by, the Attorney General; or (B) conditional parole; but (3) may not provide the alien with work authorization (including an ""employment authorized"" endorsement or other appropriate work permit), unless the alien is lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise would (without regard to removal proceedings) be provided such authorization'}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '279.'), 'chunk': '(2) Coordination with other entities; no release on own recognizance In making determinations described in paragraph (1)(C), the Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement— (A) shall consult with appropriate juvenile justice professionals, the Director of the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of Border Security to ensure that such determinations ensure that unaccompanied alien children described in such subparagraph— (i) are likely to appear for all hearings or proceedings in which they are involved; (ii) are protected from smugglers, traffickers, or others who might seek to victimize or otherwise engage them in criminal, harmful, or exploitive activity; and (iii) are placed in a setting in which they are not likely to pose a danger to themselves or others; and (B) shall not release such children upon their own recognizance'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '6006.'), 'chunk': 'Food, medicine, and medical supplies for humanitarian purposes should be made available for Cuba under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C 2151 et seq.] and the Food for Peace Act [7 U.S.C 1691 et seq.] if the President determines and certifies to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate that the government in power in Cuba— (1) has made a public commitment to hold free and fair elections for a new government within 6 months and is proceeding to implement that decision; (2) has made a public commitment to respect, and is respecting, internationally recognized human rights and basic democratic freedoms; and (3) is not providing weapons or funds to any group, in any other country, that seeks the violent overthrow of the government of that country.'}]","[{'title': 'aguilar-mendez', 'chunk': 'The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s request for voluntary departure.

"Under what circumstances can an immigrant investor compel USCIS to expedite the adjudication of their I-526 petition, particularly if they are from an underrepresented country and have waited for approximately 29 months, including a period when the underlying program was temporarily lapsed?","An immigrant investor generally cannot compel USCIS to expedite the adjudication of an I-526 petition under such circumstances.

"An individual's EB-5 visa petition was initially approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) but later revoked.

"An undocumented immigrant, Mr. Garcia, received a Notice to Appear (NTA) from the Department of Homeland Security in 2020 that charged him with removability but did not specify the date or time of his initial hearing. Mr. Garcia applied for cancellation of removal, arguing that his U.S. citizen child, who suffers from a severe, rare medical condition requiring ongoing specialized treatment, would face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if he were removed. He also sought administrative closure while pursuing a U visa. The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied cancellation of removal, finding Mr. Garcia failed to establish the requisite hardship and good moral character, and did not rule on the motion for administrative closure. On appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), Mr. Garcia argued the NTA was deficient, depriving the agency of jurisdiction or, alternatively, constituting a claim-processing error. He also challenged the IJ's hardship finding and reiterated his request for administrative closure. After the BIA dismissed his appeal, his U visa application was denied, and he was subsequently removed. Can Mr. Garcia successfully challenge the BIA's decision regarding the NTA deficiency, the hardship finding for cancellation of removal, or the denial of administrative closure?","No, Mr. Garcia cannot successfully challenge the BIA's decision on these grounds.
1.  **NTA Deficiency:** The omission of time and place information from a Notice to Appear (NTA) does not deprive the Immigration Judge of subject-matter jurisdiction over removal proceedings. Furthermore, an objection to a noncompliant NTA is a claim-processing rule that is waived or forfeited if not timely raised by the closing of pleadings before the IJ.
2.  **Exceptional Hardship for Cancellation of Removal:** While the application of the ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" standard is a mixed question of law and fact reviewable by the court, the agency's underlying factual findings are unreviewable. Taking the agency's factual findings as conclusive (unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary), such as the availability of transportation for medical appointments, sufficient involvement by the other parent, and adequate financial support, the agency did not err in determining that Mr. Garcia's removal would not result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his qualifying relative. The agency's no-hardship finding is dispositive, making it unnecessary to reach any flaws in a moral-character analysis.
3.  **Administrative Closure:** Mr. Garcia's claim that the BIA abused its discretion by denying his motion for administrative closure or a continuance has been mooted by the denial of his U visa application and his subsequent removal from the United States, as it is impossible for the court to grant him any effectual relief.","[('usc', '8', '1229'), ('usc', '8', '1252'), ('usc', '8', '1182'), ('cfr', '8', '214.14'), ('usc', '8', '1101')]","['wilkinson v garland', 'ins v bagamasbad', 'jimenez-rodriguez v garland', 'mendoza-flores v rosen', 'nkenglefac v garland', 'meridor v u.s. atty gen.', 'guerrero-lasprilla v barr', 'fuentes-pena v barr', 'rodriguez v garland', 'hernandez-castillo v sessions', 'niz-chavez v garland', 'patel v garland', 'hernandez v garland 6th cir.', 'pereira v sessions', 'maniar v garland', 'garland v ming dai', 'campos v united states', 'saenz v garland', 'meza morales v barr', 'castillo-gutierrez v garland', 'sustaita-cordova v garland', 'carreon v garland']","[{'title': ('usc', '8', '1229'), 'chunk': ""(2) Special rule for battered spouse or child The Attorney General may cancel removal of, and adjust to the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the United States if the alien demonstrates that— (i)(I) the alien has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by a spouse or parent who is or was a United States citizen (or is the parent of a child of a United States citizen and the child has been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by such citizen parent);

"Under what circumstances can a U.S. federal court compel U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to expedite the adjudication of an I-526 immigrant investor visa petition that has been pending for over four years, where the plaintiff alleges unreasonable delay under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Mandamus Act?","A U.S. federal court would not compel USCIS to expedite an I-526 immigrant investor visa petition that has been pending for over four years if the plaintiff fails to plausibly allege unreasonable delay under the ""TRAC"" factors. In this case, the court found that USCIS's processing system, which includes a ""visa availability approach"" prioritizing applicants from countries with available or soon-to-be-available visas, and a modified ""first-in, first-out"" methodology within queues for specific commercial enterprises, adheres to an ""identifiable rationale"" (TRAC factor 1). Although Congress has expressed a ""sense of Congress"" that applications should be completed within 180 days, this is aspirational and not a binding timeline (TRAC factor 2). The court also considered the approximate 4.3-year delay in light of significant external factors, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic and a nine-month lapse in statutory authorization for the EB-5 program. The plaintiff's alleged harms, described as ""health and human prejudices,"" financial harm, and the inability to acquire lawful permanent residency, were deemed primarily economic and inherent in the immigration process, thus insufficient to weigh TRAC factors 3 and 5 in his favor, especially in the absence of severe health concerns or family separation. Furthermore, compelling USCIS to expedite the plaintiff's petition would simply move him ahead of other similarly situated applicants, interfering with agency priorities and producing no net gain (TRAC factor 4). Lastly, the plaintiff failed to plausibly allege facts supporting agency impropriety, and the nine-month processing pause was compelled by law (TRAC factor 6, which remains neutral in the absence of impropriety). Based on this analysis, the court concluded that the plaintiff failed to adequately allege unreasonable delay and therefore dismissed the complaint.","[('cfr', '8', '204.6'), ('usc', '8', '1153')]","['koutny v martin', 'palakuru v renaud', 'sanchez-mercedes v bureau of prisons', 'telecommunications research & action center v fcc', 'thomas v pompeo', 'mashpee wampanoag tribal council inc. v norton', 'nohria v renaud', 'bagherian v pompeo', 'ctr. for sci. in the pub. int. v fda', 'emerg. coal to def. educ. travel v dept of treasury', 'verma v u.s. citizenship & immigr. servs.', 'devani v u.s. citizenship & immigr. servs.', 'da costa v immigr. inv. program off.', 'ghadami v dept of homeland sec.', 'dehghanighanatghestani v mesquita', 'krihely v mayorkas', 'pushkar v blinken', 'bell atl. corp. v twombly', 'bega v jaddou', 'khoshrou v blinken', 'trudeau v ftc', 'skalka v kelly', 'xiaobing liu v blinken', 'ashcroft v iqbal', 'didban v pompeo', 'natl postal profl nurses v u.s. postal serv.', 'sarlak v pompeo', 'vafaei v united states citizenship & immigration services uscis', 'norton v s. utah wilderness all.', 'arab v blinken']","[{'title': ('usc', '19', '1517.'), 'chunk': '(3) Referral described A referral described in this paragraph is information submitted to the Commissioner by any other Federal agency, including the Department of Commerce or the United States International Trade Commission, that reasonably suggests that a person has entered covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States through evasion'}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '242'), 'chunk': ""(b) Report to Congress Not later than 1 year after December 27, 2022, the CCHT Director shall submit a report to Congress that identifies any legislation that is needed to facilitate the Department of Homeland Security's mission to end human trafficking""}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '252.'), 'chunk': '(c) Legal advisor There shall be a principal legal advisor to the Assistant Secretary of U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement The legal advisor shall provide specialized legal advice to the Assistant Secretary of U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement and shall represent the agency in all exclusion, deportation, and removal proceedings before the Executive Office for Immigration Review.'}]","[{'title': 'suarez v cowan', 'chunk': 'In Suarez v.

"A non-citizen defendant, undocumented since age seven, pleads guilty to reduced drug charges in 2010, receiving a suspended sentence. In 2017, he faces deportation. His immigration attorneys inform him that his conviction makes him ineligible for cancellation of removal and permanently inadmissible to the U.S., which he alleges his trial counsel failed to clearly explain. His Motion for Appropriate Relief (MAR) for ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC) under *Padilla v. Kentucky*, and for his plea not being knowingly and voluntarily entered, is initially denied.

The appellate court would find that the trial court failed to make sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law on critical issues. Specifically, the trial court did not address the defendant's claims regarding the loss of eligibility for discretionary cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1229b(b)(1) and permanent inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II). For cancellation of removal, the trial court failed to make findings on the defendant's physical presence, good moral character, other convictions, or the hardship his removal would cause to his U.S. citizen child, which are all prerequisites for determining the statute's potential availability to the defendant. For both cancellation of removal and inadmissibility, the trial court did not properly evaluate prejudice by determining whether the defendant demonstrated a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial, including evaluating the credibility of his affidavit on this point.

Additionally, the appellate court would rule that the trial court erred by failing to comply with its prior order, which explicitly directed the trial court to resolve ""whether [Defendant’s plea was knowingly and voluntarily entered."" This issue was not addressed at all in the trial court's subsequent order.

The appellate court would, however, agree with the trial court that the specific deportability provision under 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (deportation for conviction *after admission*) did not apply, as the defendant was never ""admitted"" to the U.S. Therefore, there could be no deficient performance or prejudice related to counsel's advice regarding that particular statute.

The plaintiffs failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits, primarily because they did not demonstrate standing, as the individual plaintiffs did not have imminent in-person hearings, and the organizational plaintiffs could not show that judges regularly denied requests for remote appearances or continuances. Moreover, the Immigration and Nationality Act's jurisdiction-channeling provisions likely foreclose access-to-counsel and due process claims, directing such challenges to federal courts of appeals, not district courts. Regarding the APA claims, the court found the challenged policies were not ""final agency action"" because legal consequences flow from individual immigration judge decisions rather than the general policies themselves. The court also determined there was no ""failure-to-act"" claim as plaintiffs could not point to a specific statutory obligation requiring the defendants to take the requested actions, and the defendants' policies were not arbitrary and capricious given the rapidly evolving public health crisis. Furthermore, the plaintiffs did not establish they would suffer imminent irreparable injury, and the balance of equities and public interest did not favor imposing a broad, one-size-fits-all injunctive relief on the government's efforts to manage the immigration system while responding to the pandemic.","[('usc', '8', '1252')]","['sierra club v epa', 'winter v nat. res. def. council inc.', 'j.e.f.m. v lynch', 'jennings v rodriguez', 'cobell v norton', 'lujan v defs. of wildlife', 'davis v pension benefit guar. corp.', 'pursuing am.s greatness v fec', 'national immigration project of the national lawyers guild v executive office of immigration review', 'aguilar v u.s. immigration & customs enft div. of dept of homeland sec.', 'arpaio v obama', 'cityfed fin. corp. v office of thrift supervision', 'p.l. v u.s. immigration & customs enft', 'bennett v spear', 'norton v s. utah wilderness all.', 'o.a. v trump', 'steel co. v citizens for a better envt', 'clark v clark', 'spokeo inc. v robbins']","[{'title': ('usc', '6', '466.'), 'chunk': '(5) Existing laws, including chapter 13 of title 10 (commonly known as the ""Insurrection Act""), and the Robert T Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C 5121 et seq.), grant the President broad powers that may be invoked in the event of domestic emergencies, including an attack against the Nation using weapons of mass destruction, and these laws specifically authorize the President to use the Armed Forces to help restore public order'}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1186'), 'chunk': ""(3) Personal interview The interview under subsection (c)(1)(B) shall be conducted within 90 days after the date of submitting a petition under subsection (c)(1)(A) and at a local office of the Department of Homeland Security, designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security, which is convenient to the parties involved The Secretary of Homeland Security, in the Secretary's discretion, may waive the deadline for an interview under subsection (c)(1)(B) or the requirement for such an interview according to criteria developed by U.S Citizenship and Immigration Services, in consultation with its Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate and U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement, provided that such criteria do not include a reduction of case processing times or the allocation of adjudicatory resources A waiver may not be granted under this subparagraph if the alien to be interviewed— (i) invested in a regional center, new commercial enterprise, or job-creating entity that was sanctioned under section 1153(b)(5) of this title; or (ii) is in a class of aliens determined by the Secretary to be threats to public safety or national security""}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '8724.'), 'chunk': '(c) Continuation of sanctions with respect to the Central Bank of Iran In addition to the sanctions referred to in subsection (a), the President shall continue to apply to the Central Bank of Iran sanctions pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C 1701 et seq.), including blocking of property and restrictions or prohibitions on financial transactions and the exportation of property, until the date that is 90 days after the date on which the President submits to Congress the certification described in subsection (d)'}]","[{'title': 'garcia ramirez v us immigration and custom enforcement', 'chunk': '36) is DENIED,  and Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification (ECF No. 6) is GRANTED.

"An alien investor obtained $500,000 via a personal loan from a third-party, which was then wired to their personal account, converted to U.S. currency, and invested as cash into a new commercial enterprise for an EB-5 visa petition. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) denied the petition, asserting that the invested cash loan proceeds constituted ""indebtedness"" under 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e) and required collateralization by personal assets, which the investor failed to demonstrate. The investor challenges this denial. Based on the ruling in Case_zhang_v_united_states_citizenship_and_immigration_services, should the investor's petition be denied on these grounds?","No, the investor's petition should not be denied on these grounds. The court found that USCIS's interpretation of 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e)—that third-party loan proceeds invested as cash are properly characterized as ""indebtedness"" requiring personal collateralization—is plainly erroneous. The regulation unambiguously defines ""capital"" to include ""cash,"" and the ordinary meaning of ""cash"" encompasses cash loan proceeds. The court clarified that the regulation directs the agency to identify the asset *actually contributed* to the enterprise, which in this scenario is cash. The collateralization requirement for ""indebtedness"" only applies when the investor contributes a promise to pay (indebtedness to the enterprise itself), not when the enterprise receives readily deployable cash. Furthermore, USCIS's interpretation effectively amends the regulation by adding a new requirement for cash investments without proper notice and comment, thus violating the Administrative Procedure Act. Therefore, USCIS's denial of such petitions is arbitrary and capricious, and the denials should be vacated and remanded for reconsideration consistent with this understanding.","[('usc', '8', '1361'), ('usc', '8', '1202'), ('usc', '8', '1153'), ('cfr', '8', '204.6'), ('usc', '8', '1186')]","['thomas jefferson univ. v shalala', 'motor vehicle mfrs. assn of u.s. inc. v state farm mut. auto. ins.', 'united states v.', 'zhang v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'christensen v harris county', 'auer v robbins']","[{'title': ('usc', '6', '278.'), 'chunk': '(a) Establishment of tracking system The Secretary, not later than 1 year after the effective date of this chapter, in consultation with the Technology Advisory Committee established under subsection (c), shall establish an Internet-based system, that will permit a person, employer, immigrant, or nonimmigrant who has filings with the Secretary for any benefit under the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C 1101 et seq.), access to online information about the processing status of the filing involved'}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '222.'), 'chunk': 'For fiscal year 2012 and thereafter, U.S Customs and Border Protection\'s Advanced Training Center is authorized to charge fees for any service and/or thing of value it provides to Federal Government or non-government entities or individuals, so long as the fees charged do not exceed the full costs associated with the service or thing of value provided: Provided, That notwithstanding section 3302(b) of title 31, fees collected by the Advanced Training Center are to be deposited into a separate account entitled ""Advanced Training Center Revolving Fund"", and be available, without further appropriations, for necessary expenses of the Advanced Training Center program, and are to remain available until expended.'}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1182.'), 'chunk': '(ii) If the Secretary finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, a willful failure to meet a condition of paragraph (1), a willful misrepresentation of material fact in an application, or a violation of clause (iv)— (I) the Secretary shall notify the Attorney General of such finding and may, in addition, impose such other administrative remedies (including civil monetary penalties in an amount not to exceed $5,000 per violation) as the Secretary determines to be appropriate; and (II) the Attorney General shall not approve petitions filed with respect to that employer under section 1154 or 1184(c) of this title during a period of at least 2 years for aliens to be employed by the employer'}]","[{'title': 'espino v doj', 'chunk': 'The court case, Espino v.

"An Iranian national applies for an EB-5 immigrant investor visa, claiming to have invested $500,000 from the sale of gold coins, rental income, and her husband's income. Due to sanctions, she used third-party trading companies in Dubai to transfer the funds to the U.S. investment.

The AAO was within its discretion to demand evidence tracing the funds from the applicant's bank account to the wiring entities, even if the applicant faced difficulties due to banking restrictions and third-party non-cooperation. The applicant's unsupported affidavit regarding the movement of funds through an unidentified person is insufficient to meet the burden of proof, as the agency relies on the absence of corroborating evidence. Furthermore, the AAO, exercising de novo review, was permitted to identify and base its denial on the currency discrepancy in the gold coin invoice, even if it was not raised in the initial denial, because the inconsistency was present in a document submitted by the applicant herself and did not require the agency to provide an opportunity to rebut derogatory information unknown to the applicant. The court cannot reweigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the agency on factual findings. Since both grounds for the AAO's denial are independent and valid, the agency's action was not arbitrary and capricious.","[('cfr', '8', '103.2'), ('cfr', '8', '204.6'), ('usc', '8', '1153')]","['motor vehicle mfrs. assn of u.s. inc. v state farm mut. auto. ins.', 'ctr. for food safety v salazar', 'am. bioscience inc. v thompson', 'carnegie natl gas co. v ferc', 'pierce v sec', 'taco especial v napolitano', 'soltane v u.s. dept of justice', 'doe', 'sadeghzadeh v united states citizenship & immigration services']","[{'title': ('usc', '8', '1154.'), 'chunk': '(ii) Aliens claiming status as a special immigrant under section 1101(a)(27)(D) of this title may file a petition only with the Secretary of State and only after notification by the Secretary that such status has been recommended and approved pursuant to such section (H)(i) Any alien seeking classification under section 1153(b)(5) of this title may file a petition for such classification with the Secretary of Homeland Security An alien seeking to pool his or her investment with 1 or more additional aliens seeking classification under section 1153(b)(5) of this title shall file for such classification in accordance with section 1153(b)(5)(E) of this title, or before March 15, 2022, in accordance with section 1153(b)(5) of this title An alien petitioning for classification under section 1153(b)(5)(E) of this title may file a petition with the Secretary after a regional center has filed an application for approval of an investment under section 1153(b)(5)(F) of this title'}, {'title': ('usc', '19', '2492.'), 'chunk': '(B) Has that government taken the legal and law enforcement measures to enforce in its territory, to the maximum extent possible, the elimination of illicit cultivation and the suppression of illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in narcotic and psychotropic drugs and other controlled substances, as evidenced by seizures of such drugs and substances and of illicit laboratories and the arrest and prosecution of violators involved in the traffic in such drugs and substances significantly affecting the United States?

"A foreign investor seeks an EB-5 visa through a regional center, proposing to invest $500,000 in a new commercial enterprise (NCE) that will loan funds to multiple job-creating entities (JCEs) for various mining projects in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA). At the time of filing the Form I-526 petition, the investor's business plan and offering memorandum list four potential mining locations, but explicitly state that not all have been formally approved, and alternative or additional projects are unspecified and unapproved if initial projects fall through or require less funding. The plan includes an economic report projecting job creation based on mining expenditures but without specific JCE locations. USCIS denies the petition, citing failure to establish TEA qualification and job creation at the time of filing, and views subsequent clarification of JCE locations as an impermissible material change. Can the investor successfully challenge this denial, arguing that the NCE was clearly intended to operate in a TEA and that their economic report adequately demonstrated job creation potential, irrespective of specific JCE locations at filing?","No, the investor cannot successfully challenge the denial. A U.S. District Court has upheld USCIS's denial of similar EB-5 visa petitions on two independent grounds: (1) failure to establish that the Job Creating Entities (JCEs) were principally doing business in a Targeted Employment Area (TEA) at the time of filing, and (2) failure to establish that the investments would create full-time positions for at least ten qualifying employees at the time of filing. For regional center investments, the ""principally doing business"" requirement applies to the JCEs, not the New Commercial Enterprise (NCE). The Court found it reasonable for USCIS to conclude that the investor failed to meet the TEA requirement because the JCEs were not fully identified or approved at the time of filing, making it impossible to determine if the $500,000 TEA investment threshold was met. Furthermore, changes to JCE locations after filing were deemed impermissible material changes affecting eligibility. Regarding job creation, the Court found that the initial business plan, lacking specified JCE locations, was not sufficiently comprehensive to support a credible economic analysis for prospective job creation at the time of filing. USCIS could not assess the reasonableness of assumptions about the geographic impact of projects without this information. Subsequent economic reports based on later-identified JCEs were also rejected due to the material change doctrine, which requires eligibility to be established at the time of filing.","[('cfr', '8', '103.2'), ('cfr', '8', '204.6'), ('usc', '8', '1153')]","['wang v uscis', 'ctr. for food safety v salazar', 'motor vehicle mfrs. assn of u.s. inc. v state farm mut. auto. ins.', 'united states v.', 'am. bioscience inc. v thompson', 'kungys v united states', 'citizens to preserve overton park inc. v volpe', 'sussex engineering ltd. v montgomery', 'fogo de chao holdings inc. v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'dist. hosp. partners l.p. v burwell', 'assoc. of data processing serv. orgs. inc. v bd. of govs. of fed. reserve sys.', 'southeast conference v vilsack', 'indiana municipal power agency v ferc', 'fcc v fox television stations inc.', 'yang v holder']","[{'title': ('usc', '6', '125.'), 'chunk': '(b) Feasibility and advisability report Not later than 120 days after December 19, 2014, the Secretary of Homeland Security, acting through the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis, shall submit to the congressional intelligence committees a report that— (1) examines the feasibility and advisability of including the budget request for all intelligence activities of each intelligence component of the Department that predominantly support departmental missions, as designated by the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis, in the Homeland Security Intelligence Program; and (2) includes a plan to enhance the coordination of department-wide intelligence activities to achieve greater efficiencies in the performance of the Department of Homeland Security intelligence functions'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '262'), 'chunk': '(c) Duties of Administrator of Agency for International Development The Administrator of the Agency for International Development shall— (1) in the submission of future ""early warning system"" reports, as required by the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1988, make use of resources that promote the conservation of biological diversity, such as Conservation Data Centers; (2) submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations, by January 15, 1989, on the Agency\'s activities and practices which encourage or discourage the use of renewable energy technologies overseas, and on ways to correct or refocus those efforts This report shall include but is not limited to Agency activities which could be directed to develop a stronger interface with the private sector through the establishment of a United States Renewable Energy Industry Advisory Council; (3) issue guidance to all Agency missions stating that renewable energy resources and conservation are to be the centerpiece of its energy efforts, and meeting energy needs through these means shall be discussed in every Country Development Strategy Statement; and (4) take steps to implement recommendations set forth by a report of the Committee on Health and Environment on opportunities for the Agency to assist developing countries in the proper use of agricultural and industrial chemicals.'}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '1203.'), 'chunk': '(c) Requirement The Secretary shall require motor carriers that have a hazardous material safety permit under part 385 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, to maintain, follow, and carry a route plan, in written or electronic format, that meets the requirements of section 397.101 of that title when transporting the type and quantity of hazardous materials described in section 385.403 if the Secretary determines, under the assessment required in subsection (b), that such a requirement would enhance security and safety without imposing unreasonable costs or burdens upon motor carriers.'}]","[{'title': 'w-e-r-b', 'chunk': 'Matter of Negusie, 27 I&N Dec. 481 (A.G. 2018); see also Matter of E-L-H-, 23 I&N Dec. 700, 702 (A.G. 2004) (stating that “if a Board decision has been certified to the Attorney General, it is neither final nor effective during the pendency of the Attorney General’s review”).

"Nikunj Devani, a citizen of India, filed an EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program petition (Form I-526) in October 2019, which USCIS has yet to process. He alleges unreasonable delay, seeking to compel USCIS to adjudicate his petition, despite USCIS's visa availability approach and a 9-month lapse in the Regional Center Program's authorization. Will the court compel USCIS to expedite processing of his I-526 petition, considering the TRAC factors for unreasonable delay?","No, the court will dismiss Devani's action, denying his request to compel USCIS to process his I-526 petition. The court found that Devani failed to state a plausible claim of unreasonable delay under the TRAC factors.
1.  **Rule of Reason & Congressional Timetable:** USCIS's visa availability approach, which processes petitions on a modified ""first-in, first-out"" basis prioritizing petitioners from countries below visa caps, constitutes a rule of reason. Congress has not mandated a binding timeline for I-526 processing; the ""sense of Congress"" resolution is merely hortatory. The effective 32-month delay (accounting for a 9-month lapse in statutory authority) is not unreasonable, especially compared to the current average 52-month processing time for Indian applicants.
2.  **Prejudice to Health, Welfare, and Other Interests:** Devani's alleged financial and immigration-related harms (uncertainty) are considered inherent risks of the I-526 application process and do not rise to the level of harm, such as significant threats to physical health or safety, typically warranting intervention under these factors.

"A U.S. citizen sponsoring an immigrant spouse through a USCIS Form I-864 Affidavit of Support has separated from the spouse. The immigrant spouse seeks damages for breach of the Affidavit of Support, repayment of a personal loan, and attorney's fees. What are the legal obligations of the sponsor regarding the Affidavit of Support, including the relevant household size and income calculations, and what remedies are available for the loan and fees?","The trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the Affidavit of Support claims for all relevant years, as the plaintiff's prayer for relief covered all damages. However, the trial court erred by calculating damages using the 125% Federal Poverty Level (FPL) Guidelines for a two-person household; it should have used the guidelines for a one-person household, as the child was a U.S. citizen and not a sponsored alien. The trial court did not err by calculating the sponsored immigrant's income using Adjusted Gross Income, allowing for the deduction of depreciation expenses.

Regarding the personal loan, the defendant's argument that an implied-in-fact contract existed (instead of a quasi-contract) was waived because it contradicted their position at trial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not crediting the defendant for ""sweat equity"" on other properties when fashioning the equitable remedy for the loan used to purchase the income-producing property. The trial court did err by awarding repayment of the loan in U.S. Dollars (USD) instead of Australian Dollars (AUD); the award must be converted to AUD on remand.

The trial court's decision to hold an additional conference before the final order was entered, and any missing portions of the trial transcript, did not constitute reversible error because the defendant failed to show prejudice. Finally, the trial court did not err by awarding reasonable attorney's fees to the immigrant spouse for prevailing on her Affidavit of Support claims, though the amount may be reconsidered on remand due to the reduction in damages owed.","[('usc', '8', '1183'), ('usc', '8', '1182'), ('cfr', '8', '213')]","['suozzo v suozzo', 'anderson v anderson', 'younis v farooqi', 'zhu v deng', 'mckoy v mckoy', 'kinlaw v harris', 'weil v herring', 'tohato inc. v pinewild mgmt.', 'erler v erler erler ii', 'villars v villars', 'n.c. ins. guar. assn v weathersfield mgmt.', 'martin v n.c. dept. of health & human servs.', 'flores v flores', 'barnett v barnett', 'pelc v pham', 'bartlett milling co. v walnut grove auction & realty', 'wenfang liu v mund', 'erler v erler erler i', 'state v sharpe']","[{'title': ('usc', '8', '1183'), 'chunk': '(2) Period of enforceability An affidavit of support shall be enforceable with respect to benefits provided for an alien before the date the alien is naturalized as a citizen of the United States, or, if earlier, the termination date provided under paragraph (3)'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '2656'), 'chunk': ""(c) Content of briefings The briefing materials required under subsection (b) shall include, with respect to a covered country hosting an international athletic competition in which individuals may represent the United States, the following: (1) Information on the human rights concerns present in such covered country, as described in the Department of State's Annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices""}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '473.'), 'chunk': '(7) Hero Corps hiring The Secretary shall establish within Homeland Security Investigations positions, which shall be in addition to any positions in existence on December 21, 2019, for the hiring and permanent employment of graduates of the paid internship program required to be established under paragraph (1)'}]","[{'title': 'tekway inc. v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'chunk': 'TEKWAY INC. sued UNITED STATES CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES on Feb 29, 2019, challenging the denial of two Form I-129 visas.

"Under what circumstances, as per the District Court's ruling, can a coalition challenge specific immigration policy changes for lack of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and what types of challenges are generally dismissed?","A coalition can challenge specific immigration policy changes for lack of NEPA review under the APA if at least one plaintiff has constitutional standing and the claims fall within NEPA's zone of interests. For standing, a plaintiff must show a concrete procedural injury under NEPA, impairment of concrete environmental interests (e.g., direct harm to land, disruption of enjoyment), causation (a demonstrable increase in risk to particularized interests due to non-compliance), and redressability (the court ordering the agency to undertake the procedure could mitigate harm). The alleged injuries must have a sufficiently close connection to the physical environment.

However, challenges are dismissed if they are:
1.  **To an agency's NEPA instruction manual:** Such a manual is not considered ""final agency action"" under the APA if it is not the consummation of the agency’s decision-making process and does not create new legal obligations or impose legal consequences.
2.  **A broad ""programmatic"" challenge:** The APA limits review to ""discrete"" agency actions, precluding broad programmatic attacks that lump together numerous diffuse policy changes without identifying a single order, regulation, or completed universe of orders and regulations.
3.  **Barred by specific statutory schemes:** While challenges to generally applicable rules or policies regarding immigration (like administrative closure or rescission of certain ""Remain in Mexico"" policies) are reviewable, challenges to individual orders of removal or actions committed to agency discretion by law are generally not. The court specifically noted that INA provisions channeling review of removal orders to circuit courts do not bar challenges to the lack of NEPA analysis for general policy changes.

Specific immigration policy changes that survived dismissal in this case for potential NEPA review include:
*   Ending construction of the southern border wall.
*   Terminating ""Remain in Mexico"" policies (Migrant Protection Protocols, Asylum Cooperative Agreements, Prompt Asylum Claim Review, Humanitarian Asylum Review Process).
*   Allowing border patrol agents to grant permission for aliens to stay and helping them board buses.
*   Preventing immigration officials from detaining and removing aliens (challenging the general policy, not individual decisions).
*   Ending the practice of fining aliens for failing to leave the country (challenging the general policy).
*   Reinstating administrative closure in immigration courts.
*   Expanding various refugee programs (challenging the Department of State's actions to resettle refugees, specifically its requests for proposals and awards to grantees, rather than the Presidential refugee admission ceiling).","[('usc', '8', '1158'), ('usc', '8', '1252')]","['whitman v am. trucking assns', 'sierra club v epa', 'biden v texas', 'catawaba cnty. v epa', 'united transp. union v icc', 'arizona v mayorkas', 'sugar cane growers coop. of fla. v veneman', 'j.e.f.m. v lynch', 'competitive enter. inst. v natl highway traffic safety admin.', 'center for biological diversity v trump', 'scenic am. inc. v u.s. dept of transp.', 'soundboard assn v ftc', 'jennings v rodriguez', 'cement kiln recycling corp. v epa', 'mountain states legal found. v glickman', 'lujan v defs. of wildlife', 'natl assn of home builders v norton', 'zukerman v usps', 'cal. cattlemens assn v u.s. fish & wildlife serv.', 'united states v texas', 'las ams. immigrant advoc. ctr. v wolf', 'gunpowder riverkeeper v ferc', 'block v cmty. nutrition inst.', 'massachusetts coalition for immigration reform v us citizenship and immigration services', 'texas v biden', 'lincoln v vigil', 'summers v earth island inst.', 'city of dania beach fla. v faa', 'arizona v biden', 'lujan v natl wildlife fedn', 'bell atl. corp. v twombly', 'natl min. assn v mccarthy', 'fund for animals inc. v u.s. bureau of land mgmt.', 'i.n.s. v st. cyr', 'arpaio v obama', 'darby v cisneros', 'osborn v visa inc.', 'ashcroft v iqbal', 'robertson v methow valley citizens council', 'metro. edison co. v people against nuclear energy', 'texas v united states', 'bennett v spear', 'norton v s. utah wilderness all.', 'lexmark intl inc. v static control components inc.', 'city of los angeles v lyons', 'cal. cmtys. against toxics v epa', 'sierra club v jackson', 'am. fedn of govt. emps. afl-cio v trump', 'o.a. v trump', 'holistic candlers & consumers assn v fda', 'spokeo inc. v robbins', 'natl audubon socy inc. v watt', 'fla. audubon socy v bentsen', 'heckler v chaney', 'banneker ventures llc v graham']","[{'title': ('usc', '6', '1137.'), 'chunk': '(a) In general Not later than 90 days after August 3, 2007, the Secretary shall develop and issue detailed interim final regulations, and not later than 1 year after August 3, 2007, the Secretary shall develop and issue detailed final regulations, for a public transportation security training program to prepare public transportation employees, including frontline employees, for potential security threats and conditions'}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '663.'), 'chunk': '(f) Privacy Officer review Not later than 1 year after December 18, 2015, the Privacy Officer appointed under section 142 of this title, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall review the policies and guidelines for the program carried out under this section to ensure that the policies and guidelines are consistent with applicable privacy laws, including those governing the acquisition, interception, retention, use, and disclosure of communications.'}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '1208.'), 'chunk': '(d) Report (1) Contents Not later than 2 years after August 3, 2007, the Secretary shall transmit to the appropriate congressional committees a report containing the plan required by subsection (a), including an estimate of the private and public sector costs to implement any recommendations'}]","[{'title': 'united states v primera enters., inc.', 'chunk': 'The provided text discusses the legal case of United States v.

"A noncitizen defendant seeks to withdraw a guilty plea, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to advise him of the adverse immigration consequences, specifically that relief under INA Section 212(c) was unavailable.

To establish prejudice for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the plea context, the defendant must show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. In this situation, the defendant's affidavit alone is insufficient without contemporaneous evidence to substantiate that avoiding deportation was the determinative issue. The record lacks evidence of the defendant's motivations beyond the affidavit, especially since counsel invoked attorney-client privilege. Furthermore, despite receiving advice that relief under Section 212(c) was discretionary and not assured, the defendant still pleaded guilty to a deportable offense. The trial court also provided a statutory advisement about potential deportation consequences, and there is no indication the defendant misunderstood it. Finally, the defendant faced significantly harsher consequences (18 felony counts, including first-degree rape, with potential life sentences and firearm specifications) by going to trial compared to the plea agreement (sexual battery and attempted abduction with suspended sentences and probation), making the decision to plead guilty appear rational.

"An individual, a native of Tanzania, entered the U.S. on a student visa and subsequently married a U.S. citizen. This marriage was later annulled, but before the annulment, the U.S. citizen spouse filed an I-130 petition on the individual's behalf, which was later denied due to the U.S. citizen spouse's fraudulent multiple marriages. The individual then married a second U.S. citizen, claiming battery and extreme cruelty, and filed an I-360 self-petition. The USCIS and AAO denied this I-360 petition, citing the previous marriage as fraudulent under Section 204(c) and also finding a failure to prove good faith in the second marriage. The individual appeals, arguing that the annulment means the first marriage never existed and that the previous I-130 denial should not apply to the current I-360 petition. Is the agency's decision to deny the I-360 petition, based on the prior fraudulent marriage and lack of good faith in the second marriage, arbitrary or capricious?","No, the agency's decision to deny the I-360 petition was neither arbitrary nor capricious. The court found that there was more than enough evidence to support the conclusion that the plaintiff and his first U.S. citizen spouse did not marry in good faith, given the spouse's conviction for marriage fraud involving five marriages. The fact that the plaintiff obtained an annulment did not establish his intent at the time of the marriage. Therefore, the I-360 petition was properly denied because the plaintiff had previously sought immediate relative status based on a marriage determined to be for the purpose of evading immigration laws, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c). Additionally, the court found an independent basis for denial: the plaintiff failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he entered into his second marriage in good faith, as required for the I-360 petition, having provided limited probative details beyond the abuse he sustained.","[('cfr', '8', '204.1'), ('usc', '8', '1151'), ('usc', '8', '1154'), ('cfr', '8', '204.2')]","['motor vehicle mfrs. assn of u.s. inc. v state farm mut. auto. ins.', 'united states v.', 'basil v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'citizens to preserve overton park inc. v volpe', 'camp v pitts']","[{'title': ('usc', '8', '1154.'), 'chunk': ""(vii) An alien may file a petition with the Secretary of Homeland Security under this subparagraph for classification of the alien under section 1151(b)(2)(A)(i) of this title if the alien— (I) is the parent of a citizen of the United States or was a parent of a citizen of the United States who, within the past 2 years, lost or renounced citizenship status related to an incident of domestic violence or died; (II) is a person of good moral character; (III) is eligible to be classified as an immediate relative under section 1151(b)(2)(A)(i) of this title; (IV) resides, or has resided, with the citizen daughter or son; and (V) demonstrates that the alien has been battered or subject to extreme cruelty by the citizen daughter or son (viii)(I) Clause (i) shall not apply to a citizen of the United States who has been convicted of a specified offense against a minor, unless the Secretary of Homeland Security, in the Secretary's sole and unreviewable discretion, determines that the citizen poses no risk to the alien with respect to whom a petition described in clause (i) is filed""}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1184.'), 'chunk': '(10) An amended H–1B petition shall not be required where the petitioning employer is involved in a corporate restructuring, including but not limited to a merger, acquisition, or consolidation, where a new corporate entity succeeds to the interests and obligations of the original petitioning employer and where the terms and conditions of employment remain the same but for the identity of the petitioner (11)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Secretary of State, as appropriate, shall impose a fee on an employer who has filed an attestation described in section 1182(t) of this title— (i) in order that an alien may be initially granted nonimmigrant status described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title; or (ii) in order to satisfy the requirement of the second sentence of subsection (g)(8)(C) for an alien having such status to obtain certain extensions of stay'}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1201.'), 'chunk': ""(i) Revocation of visas or documents After the issuance of a visa or other documentation to any alien, the consular officer or the Secretary of State may at any time, in his discretion, revoke such visa or other documentation Notice of such revocation shall be communicated to the Attorney General, and such revocation shall invalidate the visa or other documentation from the date of issuance: Provided, That carriers or transportation companies, and masters, commanding officers, agents, owners, charterers, or consignees, shall not be penalized under section 1323(b) of this title for action taken in reliance on such visas or other documentation, unless they received due notice of such revocation prior to the alien's embarkation There shall be no means of judicial review (including review pursuant to section 2241 of title 28 or any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title) of a revocation under this subsection, except in the context of a removal proceeding if such revocation provides the sole ground for removal under section 1227(a)(1)(B) of this title.""}]","[{'title': 'mckenzie v us citizenship & immigration services', 'chunk': '50475, 50496 (Oct. 7, 1991).

"In an Administrative Procedure Act (APA) challenge to the denial of an I-129 immigration petition by USCIS, where the plaintiffs reside in Washington and the petition was adjudicated by a USCIS service center in California, can the case initially filed in the District of Columbia be transferred to another district, and what factors guide such a transfer decision?","Yes, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia can transfer such a case to another district, specifically to the Central District of California, based on the court's authority under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) for the ""convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice.""

The court's decision is guided by a two-fold inquiry:
1.  **Could the case have been brought in the transferee district?** Yes, both the Central District of California (where a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred, as the USCIS California Service Center adjudicated the petition) and the Western District of Washington (where the plaintiffs reside) are proper venues under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1).
2.  **Do private and public interests favor transfer?** The court found that these interests largely weigh in favor of transfer to the Central District of California.
    *   **Preferred forum:** While plaintiffs preferred D.C., the deference to their choice was lessened because D.C. is not their home forum and lacks meaningful ties to the controversy. The USCIS headquarters had relocated from D.C., and the remaining D.C. offices were not involved in the petition's adjudication.
    *   **Location where the claim arose:** The claim arose in the Central District of California, where the challenged federal action (the petition denial) occurred, supporting the local interest in deciding controversies at home.
    *   **Convenience:** The Central District of California is the more convenient forum as the field office most familiar with the facts of the application is located there, and any relief granted would apply to officials in that district.
    *   **Relative congestion of the courts and familiarity with governing law:** These factors were considered neutral, as statistics on congestion were mixed, and all federal judges are presumed familiar with federal laws, including immigration disputes and the APA.

Consequently, the court granted the motion to transfer the case to the Central District of California and did not address the defendant's motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction or improper venue.","[('cfr', '8', '214.2')]","['ngonga v sessions', 'wolfram alpha llc v cuccinelli', 'natl assn of home builders v epa', 'one on one basketball inc. v glob. payments direct inc.', 'onaghise v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'ruhrgas ag v marathon oil co.', 'pasem v uscis', 'efficientip inc. v cuccinelli no.', 'bahena v renaud', 'chauhan v napolitano', 'abusadeh v chertoff no.', 'aftab v gonzalez', 'bourdon v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'wei lai development llc v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'gyau v sessions', 'al-ahmed v chertoff', 'w. watersheds project v pool', 'van dusen v barrack', 'adams v bell', 'producers of renewables united for integrity truth & transparency v epa', 'pac. mar. assn v nlrb', 'ike v uscis', 'norton v s. utah wilderness all.', 'mohammadi v scharfen', 'aracely v nielsen', 'islamic republic of iran v boeing co.']","[{'title': ('usc', '8', '1535.'), 'chunk': ""(2) No review of continued detention The determinations and actions of the Attorney General pursuant to section 1537(b)(2)(C) of this title shall not be subject to judicial review, including application for a writ of habeas corpus, except for a claim by the alien that continued detention violates the alien's rights under the Constitution Jurisdiction over any such challenge shall lie exclusively in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.""}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '4306.'), 'chunk': '(c) Filing of application with Board of Zoning Adjustment; publication of notice; public participation; final determination (1) If a foreign mission wishes to locate a chancery in an area described in subsection (b)(2), or wishes to appeal an administrative decision relating to a chancery based in whole or in part upon any zoning map or regulation, it shall file an application with the Board of Zoning Adjustment which shall publish notice of that application in the District of Columbia Register'}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1365'), 'chunk': '(3) Interoperable data system Not later than 2 years after December 17, 2004, the Secretary shall fully implement an interoperable electronic data system, as required by section 202 of the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act 2 (8 U.S.C 1722) to provide current and immediate access to information in the databases of Federal law enforcement agencies and the intelligence community that is relevant to determine— (A) whether to issue a visa; or (B) the admissibility or deportability of an alien'}]","[{'title': 'doe v mcaleenan', 'chunk': ""Doe v.

"If an individual receives a Notice to Appear (NTA) for removal proceedings that does not initially specify the time and place of the hearing, and they subsequently apply for cancellation of removal based on hardship to their children, can they challenge the validity of the NTA in federal court and appeal the Board of Immigration Appeals' (BIA) finding that their children would not face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship?","No, an individual in this situation would likely not succeed in challenging the NTA's validity or appealing the hardship determination.
Regarding the NTA, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that an NTA which does not list the time and place of the initial hearing is not defective as a valid charging document, because regulations (8 C.F.R. § 1003.18(b)), not the statute (8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)), govern what an NTA must contain, and subsequent notices can cure any deficiency by providing the required information. The court found this argument foreclosed by its own binding circuit precedent.
Regarding the hardship determination, the court explicitly stated it lacked jurisdiction to review the BIA's finding that removal would not cause exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the individual's children.

"Can a U.S. lawful permanent resident successfully sue the U.S. State Department for unreasonable delay in processing an immigrant visa for their spouse under the Administrative Procedure Act, or for violating their Fifth Amendment due process rights, given a processing delay of under two years exacerbated by a global pandemic?","No, a U.S. lawful permanent resident cannot successfully sue the U.S. State Department for unreasonable delay or Fifth Amendment due process violations under these circumstances.

The Court dismissed the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claim for unreasonable delay because:
1.  The State Department's practice of processing visa applications on a first-in, first-out basis is considered a ""rule of reason"" for decision-making, and Congress has not established a specific statutory timetable for visa processing.
2.  A delay of approximately fourteen months (less than two years) is not deemed unreasonable as a matter of law, especially given the extraordinary backlog of cases (increasing from approximately 75,000 to 473,000) and the disruption to services caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic.
3.  Granting relief would place the plaintiff ahead of other similarly situated applicants, interfering with the State Department's allocation of resources and its prioritization of ""mission critical"" functions during the pandemic.
4.  The plaintiff's broad allegations regarding the delay's toll on his physical and mental health and the harm to his family were insufficient to meet the criteria for human health and welfare or other interests prejudiced by the delay.
5.  No impropriety or bad faith on the part of the agency was alleged.
Consequently, the mandamus action based on the APA claim also failed.

The Court dismissed the Fifth Amendment due process claims (both substantive and procedural) because:
1.  There is no fundamental liberty interest in having a spouse's visa application granted or processed more quickly, as admission of aliens to the United States is a privilege granted by the sovereign, not a right. The Supreme Court precedent, such as *Kerry v. Din*, explicitly forecloses such a substantive due process argument.
2.  Since there is no protected liberty or property interest at stake in an immigrant visa and a process governed by a rule of reason exists for applicants, there can be no procedural due process violation.
The plaintiff's equal protection claim, also a Fifth Amendment claim, was dismissed as a matter of law for similar reasons.

Claims against the DHS defendants were dismissed as moot because the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) had already approved the I-130 petition and transferred it to the National Visa Center, completing its role in the process. Additionally, claims concerning the Controlled Application Review and Resolution Program (CARRP) were dismissed as moot against DHS and constitutionally unripe against the State Department, as CARRP is a DHS policy.","[('cfr', '8', '204.1'), ('cfr', '22', '42.81'), ('cfr', '22', '42.67'), ('cfr', '8', '204.2')]","['koutny v martin', 'united states v.', 'palakuru v renaud', 'telecommunications research & action center v fcc', 'mashpee wampanoag tribal council inc. v norton', 'papasan v allain', 'willson v commr', 'thakker v renaud', 'grand lodge of fraternal order of police v ashcroft', 'bagherian v pompeo', 'nohria v renaud', 'yavari v pompeo', 'colindres v u.s. dept of state', 'hinton v corr. corp. of am.', 'kangarloo v pompeo', 'mathews v eldridge', 'gustaveschmidt v chao', 'moore v city of e. cleveland', 'jafarzadeh v duke', 'bell atl. corp. v twombly', 'smirnov v clinton', 'ren v mueller', 'settles v u.s. parole commn', 'ward v d.c. dept of youth rehab. servs.', 'xiaobing liu v blinken', 'skalka v kelly', 'ashcroft v iqbal', 'jingjing v mayorkas', 'fangfang xu v cissna', 'nibber v u.s. citizenship & immigr. servs.', 'natl postal profl nurses v u.s. postal serv.', 'tate v pompeo', 'obergefell v hodges', 'kerry v din', 'abhe & svoboda inc. v chao', 'coal. for underground expansion v mineta', 'washington v glucksberg', 'herbert v natl acad. of scis.', 'us immigration fund-ny llc v pekoske', 'manzoor v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'muvvala v wolf', 'trudeau v fed. trade commn']","[{'title': ('usc', '6', '242'), 'chunk': ""(b) Report to Congress Not later than 1 year after December 27, 2022, the CCHT Director shall submit a report to Congress that identifies any legislation that is needed to facilitate the Department of Homeland Security's mission to end human trafficking""}, {'title': ('usc', '19', '1683'), 'chunk': '(2) Not later than 12 months after June 18, 2008, a report on whether countries that export softwood lumber or softwood lumber products to the United States are complying with any international agreements entered into by those countries and the United States.'}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1188.'), 'chunk': '(d) Roles of agricultural associations (1) Permitting filing by agricultural associations A petition to import an alien as a temporary agricultural worker, and an application for a labor certification with respect to such a worker, may be filed by an association of agricultural producers which use agricultural services'}]","[{'title': 'cameron v thornburgh', 'chunk': ""The court case PSV ENTERPRISES, LLC v.

"An EB-5 investor, John, filed a Form I-526 petition based on an investment in a limited partnership that included a ""Call Option"" allowing the general partner to repurchase John's interest for a fixed amount if the business was successful. USCIS denied John's petition, stating the Call Option meant his capital was not ""at risk"" and was a ""guaranteed return."" Concurrently, other investors in the same partnership, who submitted functionally identical petitions, received different denial notices from USCIS, citing various other reasons or fewer reasons for denial, with no explanation for the varied treatment. If John challenges USCIS's decision under the Administrative Procedure Act, what is the likely outcome regarding the ""at risk"" determination and the disparate treatment of petitions?","The court would likely find that USCIS's reasoning in denying John's petition on the grounds that the Call Option made his capital not ""at risk"" and constituted a ""guaranteed return"" was arbitrary and capricious, as the Call Option did not guarantee the return of capital regardless of the business's success or failure, nor did it provide the investor with any rights to exercise it. Additionally, the court would likely find that USCIS acted arbitrarily and capriciously by issuing different denial notices with varying reasons to functionally equivalent petitions without providing any explanation for the disparate treatment. The appropriate remedy would be to remand John's petition to USCIS for reconsideration consistent with the court's opinion, requiring USCIS to either treat all similar petitions in the same manner or sufficiently explain any reasons for treating them differently.

"A lawful permanent resident, who is a non-English speaker with significant ties to his country of origin, pleads guilty to an aggravated felony that mandates deportation. His attorney did not explicitly advise him of the mandatory deportation consequences, and he did not request an interpreter during the plea hearing. He claims he did not fully understand the proceedings and that avoiding deportation was his primary concern, despite telling the judge at the time of the plea that he understood the potential for deportation. The trial court advised him of the possibility of deportation as required by statute, and he responded affirmatively when asked if he understood. He seeks to withdraw his plea four years later, arguing ineffective assistance of counsel and a violation of his right to an interpreter. Should the trial court grant his motion to withdraw his guilty plea?","No. A trial court should not grant a post-sentence motion to withdraw a guilty plea unless the defendant demonstrates a ""manifest injustice,"" a showing that rests on the defendant to prove extraordinary circumstances. To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must show both that counsel's performance was deficient and that, but for counsel's errors, there is a reasonable probability the result of the proceeding would have been different (prejudice). Here, even assuming counsel was deficient in not explicitly advising on mandatory deportation, the defendant could not demonstrate prejudice. Factors weighing against a finding of prejudice include: (1) Strong evidence of guilt presented by the State (video, witnesses); (2) The defendant's stated primary goal at the time of the plea was to receive probation, not to avoid deportation; (3) The defendant was aware of an ICE detainer prior to entering his plea, making his assertion of unawareness of deportation consequences not credible; (4) The defendant's limited ties to the United States and strong ties to his country of origin (unemployed, did not reside with his U.S. citizen wife, child in Haiti, only intended a brief vacation); (5) The trial court properly advised the defendant, pursuant to R.C. 2943.031(A), that his conviction could result in deportation, exclusion, or denial of naturalization, and the defendant acknowledged understanding this advisement without asking questions; (6) The defendant acknowledged reviewing and understanding the plea form, which stated his understanding of consequences for non-U.S. citizens; and (7) An unreasonable delay of four years in filing the motion to withdraw the plea. Regarding the interpreter claim, the trial court made adequate findings of fact and conclusions of law, noting the defendant's demonstrated proficiency in English during various proceedings (responding appropriately to questions, writing his version of events, communicating with probation officers without an interpreter) and that he never requested an interpreter.","[('usc', '8', '8')]","['strickland v washington', 'state v kurdi', 'state v rozell', 'padilla v kentucky', 'state v romero', 'state v galdamez', 'state v smith', 'state v woodfork', 'state v turner', 'aaaa ents. inc. v river place community urban redevelopment corp.', 'state v gilbreath', 'hill v lockhart', 'state v darmond', 'mcmann v richardson', 'state v ogletree', 'state v pierre', 'state v cardenas', 'state v xie', 'lee v united states']","[{'title': ('usc', '22', '4010.'), 'chunk': '(a) Authorization of Secretary; right to hearing; attorneys fees and backpay; leave without pay (1) The Secretary may separate any member from the Service for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the Service, including upon receiving notification from the Bureau of Diplomatic Security that such member has engaged in criminal misconduct, such as murder, rape, or other sexual assault (2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), whenever the Secretary decides under paragraph (1) to separate, on the basis of misconduct, any member of the Service (other than a United States citizen employed under section 3951 of this title who is not a family member) who either— (i) is serving under a career appointment, or (ii) is serving under a limited appointment, (B) The right to a hearing in subparagraph (A) does not apply in the case of an individual who has been convicted of a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment of more than one year may be imposed'}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1232.'), 'chunk': '(5) Access to counsel The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable and consistent with section 292 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C 1362), that all unaccompanied alien children who are or have been in the custody of the Secretary or the Secretary of Homeland Security, and who are not described in subsection (a)(2)(A), have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking To the greatest extent practicable, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall make every effort to utilize the services of pro bono counsel who agree to provide representation to such children without charge'}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1182.'), 'chunk': '(B) Before making such agreement, the accredited school has been satisfied that the alien (i) is a graduate of a school of medicine which is accredited by a body or bodies approved for the purpose by the Secretary of Education (regardless of whether such school of medicine is in the United States); or (ii)(I) has passed parts I and II of the National Board of Medical Examiners Examination (or an equivalent examination as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services), (II) has competency in oral and written English, (III) will be able to adapt to the educational and cultural environment in which he will be receiving his education or training, and (IV) has adequate prior education and training to participate satisfactorily in the program for which he is coming to the United States For the purposes of this subparagraph, an alien who is a graduate of a medical school shall be considered to have passed parts I and II of the National Board of Medical Examiners examination if the alien was fully and permanently licensed to practice medicine in a State on January 9, 1978, and was practicing medicine in a State on that date'}]","[{'title': 'aguilar-mendez', 'chunk': 'The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s request for voluntary departure.

"A U.S. citizen sponsors his alien spouse for immigration by signing a USCIS Form I-864 Affidavit of Support. At the time, they have a minor child who is a U.S. citizen and was born before the affidavit was signed, and this child is not listed on the affidavit. The couple later separates, and the sponsored spouse seeks monetary damages from the sponsor for breach of the Affidavit of Support. When calculating the sponsor's obligation, what household size should the court use for the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) Guidelines, and if the spouse also loaned the sponsor money in a foreign currency, in what currency should the repayment be awarded?","The court erred by using the FPL Guidelines for a two-person household. The sponsor only promised to support the alien spouse in the Affidavit of Support, and the U.S. citizen child was not listed on the form as an immigrant intended to be sponsored, as the Affidavit of Support does not apply to U.S. citizens. Therefore, the court should calculate the damages using the FPL Guidelines for a one-person household. For example, for 2016, if the one-person FPL Guideline was $14,850 and the spouse's adjusted gross income was $8,511, the damages would be $6,339. The court did not err by deducting depreciation expenses from the spouse's adjusted gross income when calculating damages.

Regarding the loan, as the spouse loaned and paid the sponsor in Australian Dollars (AUD), the interest was repaid in AUD, and the spouse's loss occurred in AUD, the court erred by awarding equitable relief payable in U.S. Dollars (USD). On remand, the trial court must correct and convert the spouse's equitable award and any interest thereon to be repayable in AUD for any outstanding balance. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not crediting the sponsor with any purported ""sweat equity"" for repairing other properties. The trial court's award of reasonable attorney's fees to the spouse for claims of breach of the Affidavit of Support is affirmed, but the amount may be reconsidered upon remand.","[('usc', '8', '1183'), ('usc', '8', '1182'), ('cfr', '8', '213')]","['suozzo v suozzo', 'anderson v anderson', 'younis v farooqi', 'zhu v deng', 'mckoy v mckoy', 'kinlaw v harris', 'weil v herring', 'tohato inc. v pinewild mgmt.', 'erler v erler erler ii', 'madar v madar', 'villars v villars', 'n.c. ins. guar. assn v weathersfield mgmt.', 'martin v n.c. dept. of health & human servs.', 'buncombe county ex rel andres v newburn', 'flores v flores', 'barnett v barnett', 'pelc v pham', 'gay v walter', 'iannuzzelli v lovett', 'bartlett milling co. v walnut grove auction & realty', 'm.v. eleftherotria v owner of m.v. despina r', 'wenfang liu v mund', 'erler v erler erler i', 'state v sharpe', 'state v quick']","[{'title': ('usc', '8', '1154.'), 'chunk': '(l) Surviving relative consideration for certain petitions and applications (1) In general An alien described in paragraph (2) who resided in the United States at the time of the death of the qualifying relative and who continues to reside in the United States shall have such petition described in paragraph (2), or an application for adjustment of status to that of a person admitted for lawful permanent residence based upon the family relationship described in paragraph (2), and any related applications, adjudicated notwithstanding the death of the qualifying relative, unless the Secretary of Homeland Security determines, in the unreviewable discretion of the Secretary, that approval would not be in the public interest'}, {'title': ('usc', '19', '58'), 'chunk': '(iv) Beginning in fiscal year 2021, the Secretary, in consultation with the Postmaster General, may adjust, not more frequently than once each fiscal year, the amount described in clause (i)(I) to an amount commensurate with the costs of services provided in connection with the customs processing of Inbound EMS items, consistent with the obligations of the United States under international agreements (10)(A) The fee charged under subsection (a)(9) or (10) with respect to goods of Canadian origin (as determined under section 202 of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988) when the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement is in force shall be in accordance with article 403 of that Agreement'}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '222.'), 'chunk': 'For fiscal year 2012 and thereafter, U.S Customs and Border Protection\'s Advanced Training Center is authorized to charge fees for any service and/or thing of value it provides to Federal Government or non-government entities or individuals, so long as the fees charged do not exceed the full costs associated with the service or thing of value provided: Provided, That notwithstanding section 3302(b) of title 31, fees collected by the Advanced Training Center are to be deposited into a separate account entitled ""Advanced Training Center Revolving Fund"", and be available, without further appropriations, for necessary expenses of the Advanced Training Center program, and are to remain available until expended.'}]","[{'title': 'mckenzie v us citizenship & immigration services', 'chunk': '50475, 50496 (Oct. 7, 1991).

"Under what circumstances may a U.S. District Court deny a prevailing party's motion for attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) due to insufficient proof of financial eligibility, even when an affidavit from the party attests to meeting the statutory net worth requirement?","A U.S. District Court may deny in part, without prejudice, a motion for attorney's fees under the EAJA when a prevailing party's affidavit asserting compliance with the $2,000,000 net worth requirement is insufficient, particularly when challenged by defendants citing record evidence that suggests a potentially higher net worth. While an affidavit can be an efficient way to present evidence of net worth, the court must assess the entire record to determine if the financial eligibility burden of proof is met. If the record contains significant information about the party's finances—such as ownership stakes in corporations with substantial assets, past income, or declared net worth figures—that raises concerns about the accuracy of a bare affidavit, the party must provide additional documentation regarding their assets and liabilities to reconcile the affidavit with the balance of the record. Failure to do so, by not providing documentation that aligns with or explains away conflicting record evidence, constitutes a failure to meet the burden of proof, leading the court to deny the motion without prejudice and potentially order supplemental briefing.","[('cfr', '8', '204.6')]","['huashan zhang v u.s. citizenship & immigr. servs.', 'ivy sports med. llc v burwell', 'united states v.', 'hirschey v ferc', 'broaddus v u.s. army corps of engineers', 'scarborough v principi', 'herman & maclean v huddleston', 'natl assn of mfrs. v dept of lab.', 'wash. all. of tech. workers v u.s. dept of homeland sec.', 'zhang v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'haselwander v mchugh', 'alyeska pipeline serv. co. v wilderness socy', 'sosebee v astrue', 'cobell v norton', 'shooting star ranch llc v united states']","[{'title': ('usc', '22', '1980'), 'chunk': ""(b) Documentation In seeking such reimbursement, the vessel owner shall provide, together with such other information as the Secretary of State may require— (1) a copy of the receipt for payment; (2) an affidavit attesting that the owner or the owner's agent paid the fee under protest; and (3) a copy of the vessel's certificate of documentation""}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '9007.'), 'chunk': '(2) Subject to paragraph (3), legal fees or court costs incurred in connection with an action brought under section 9003 of this title shall be borne by the petitioner unless they are covered by payments from Federal, State, or local legal assistance or other programs'}, {'title': ('usc', '19', '1592.'), 'chunk': '(9) Prior disclosure regarding claims under the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement An importer shall not be subject to penalties under subsection (a) for making an incorrect claim that a good qualifies as an originating good under section 4033 of this title if the importer, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, promptly and voluntarily makes a corrected declaration and pays any duties owing'}]","[{'title': 'farroukh v united states citizenship & immigration services, et al.', 'chunk': ""Info Labs, Inc. filed a motion for attorneys' fees and costs under the Equal Access to Justice Act.

"An asylum seeker, Mr. X, claims he fears torture if returned to his home country.

Under Department of Justice regulations implementing the CAT, an act constitutes ""torture"" only if it is inflicted or approved by a public official or other person ""acting in an official capacity,"" which means acting ""under color of law."" The ""under color of law"" standard is the *only* standard to apply; the concept of a distinct ""rogue official"" standard is rejected as risking confusion. The standard draws no categorical distinction between the acts of low- and high-level officials. An official acts ""under color of law"" when they exercise power possessed by virtue of law and made possible only because they were clothed with the authority of law. This often involves the misuse of authority, where an official uses their official authority to fulfill personal objectives. Therefore, even if the officers were motivated by personal vendettas or were considered ""corrupt, low-level agents,"" their actions would still be ""under color of law"" if they misused their power as police officers, clothed with the authority of law, to inflict the harm.

Finally, the court rejected the argument that a single-member BIA panel decision, which cannot reverse an immigration judge's order unless plainly consistent with and required by an intervening change in law, violates due process.

The Third Circuit Court of Appeals has expressly overruled the ""hybrid offense"" theory established in *Nugent v. Ashcroft*.

Each subparagraph of § 1101(a)(43) lays out a separate aggravated felony, and there is no indication in the statute that an offense must satisfy multiple subparagraphs.

"A rancher whose property is near the U.S. southern border experienced significant damage, including lost cattle profits, depleted water, and trash, directly linked to a dramatic increase in illegal immigration following the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) decisions to halt border wall construction and terminate the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) without conducting environmental analyses. Does this rancher have legal standing to challenge DHS's actions, and would DHS be found in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)?","Yes, the rancher (Steven Smith) has standing to sue, and DHS would be found in violation of NEPA.
The Court found that Smith suffered concrete and particularized injuries, including lost profits from cattle that ingested trash, depleted water reserves due to migrants tying down float systems in water troughs, and trespass with detritus left behind by migrants. These harms are considered concrete ""monetary injury"" or bear a close relationship to harms traditionally recognized in American courts. His testimony about experiencing these injuries almost daily in the last three years, in contrast to a couple of times a month during the previous administration, was found credible.
Causation was established through an ""enticement theory"" with three links supported by a preponderance of the evidence:
1.  **Relaxed Policies:** DHS's decisions to halt border wall construction and terminate MPP relaxed deterrents and consequences for illegal immigration, reversing a 27-year proven border security strategy and effectively ""unsecuring the border almost overnight,"" according to expert testimony from former senior border officials.
2.  **Responsive Migrants:** Migrants reacted predictably to these relaxed policies, leading to a sharp uptick in illegal immigration, which overwhelmed Border Patrol resources nationwide and diverted manpower away from areas like the Tucson Sector, where Smith lives, thus increasing unpatrolled areas.
3.  **Related Harms:** This dramatic increase in illegal immigration directly led to the increased migrant traffic on Smith’s land, causing the damage to his property, water, and cattle.
The Court concluded that both the cessation of border wall construction and the rescission of MPP constituted ""major Federal actions"" under NEPA, requiring environmental analysis. DHS concededly failed to perform this analysis, thus acting ""without observance of procedure required by law"" in violation of NEPA.","[('usc', '6', '211'), ('usc', '6', '101')]","['united states v richardson', 'rumsfeld v forum for acad. & instl rts. inc.', 'entick v carrington', 'flores v johnson', 'cannon v district of columbia', 'lujan v defs. of wildlife', 'grupo dataflux v atlas glob. grp. l.p.', 'new jersey v epa', 'massachusetts coalition for immigration reform v us citizenship and immigration services', 'mollan v torrance', 'cei v nhtsa', 'energy future coalition v epa', 'campbell v natl union fire ins. co. of pittsburgh pa', 'ramirez v u.s. immigr. & customs enft', 'arpaio v obama', 'murthy v missouri', 'trudeau v ftc', 'friends of the earth inc. v laidlaw envt servs. toc inc.', 'block v meese', 'massachusetts v e.p.a.', 'natl wrestling coaches assn v dept of educ.', 'competitive enter. inst. v fcc', 'bennett v spear', 'new york v u.s. dept of com.', 'defs. of wildlife inc. v endangered species sci. auth.', 'natl parks conserv. assn v manson', 'transunion llc v ramirez', 'spokeo inc. v robbins', 'simon v e. ky. welfare rts. org.', 'fla. audubon socy v bentsen', 'tozzi v hhs']","[{'title': ('usc', '22', '6442'), 'chunk': '(a) In general The President, concurrent with the annual foreign country review required under section 402(b)(1)(A) of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C 6442(b)(1)(A)), shall— (1) review and identify any non-state actors operating in any such reviewed country or surrounding region that have engaged in particularly severe violations of religious freedom; and (2) designate, in a manner consistent with such Act [22 U.S.C 6401 et seq.], each such non-state actor as an entity of particular concern for religious freedom'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '9752.'), 'chunk': ""(2) CITGO, a wholly owned subsidiary of PDVSA, is engaged in interstate commerce and owns and controls critical energy infrastructure in 19 States of the United States, including an extensive network of pipelines, 48 terminals, and 3 refineries, with a combined oil refining capacity of 749,000 barrels per day CITGO's refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana, is the sixth largest refinery in the United States""}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '262'), 'chunk': '(d) Global Warming Initiative The Administrator of the Agency for International Development shall instruct all Agency missions and bureaus to continue to implement all elements of the ""Global Warming Initiative"" as defined in, and which may continue under, the authorities of sections 2 533(c)(1) through (4) of Public Law 101–513 The Initiative shall continue to emphasize the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases through strategies consistent with continued economic development, such as forest conservation, end-use energy efficiency, least-cost energy planning, and renewable energy development The Administrator shall direct Agency mission directors to incorporate these strategies in their country programs'}]","[{'title': 'norton v s. utah wilderness all.', 'chunk': ""The case, Wei Lai Development LLC, et al. v.

"An individual applies for an EB-5 visa, having invested capital in a new commercial enterprise. Their investment agreement includes a ""call option,"" which grants the company the choice to buy out the investor's interest at a specified price after certain conditions are met, but does not give the investor any right to demand repayment. USCIS denies the EB-5 petition, asserting that the call option means the investor's capital is not ""at risk"" and thus constitutes a prohibited debt arrangement. Is USCIS's denial likely to be upheld as consistent with federal law and prior agency decisions?","No, USCIS's denial based solely on the presence of a call option that does not grant the investor a right to demand repayment is unlikely to be upheld. The court found that USCIS acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it declared investors ineligible for visas due to call options, concluding that such options do not provide investors with any right to repayment and therefore still place their capital at risk. The court distinguished a call option (a right held by the company) from a sell option (a right held by the investor, which *does* make capital not at risk), finding that USCIS's interpretation stretched the rationale of *Matter of Izummi* and conflicted with the plain language of the regulations.

"A U-visa applicant, whose application has been pending for over four years, files a lawsuit against USCIS alleging unreasonable delay in determining their eligibility for the U-visa waitlist and failure to issue interim employment authorization documents (EAD). The applicant cites a 2011 regulation mandating EAD adjudication within 90 days or the issuance of interim documents. The government moves to dismiss all claims, arguing lack of subject matter jurisdiction under IIRIRA provisions (8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(g), 1252(a)(5), and 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)) and failure to state a claim, further contending that the 2011 EAD regulation was repealed in 2017 and therefore does not apply. How should the court rule on these claims?","The court should rule as follows:
1.  **Jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(g) and 1252(a)(5):** The court possesses subject matter jurisdiction over the complaint. These IIRIRA provisions do not apply because the plaintiff is not challenging the commencement, adjudication, or execution of a removal order, nor seeking review of a removal order. Instead, the claims challenge the government's delay in adjudicating U-visa waitlist eligibility and work authorization.
2.  **Unreasonable Delay in U-Visa Waitlist Eligibility (APA & Mandamus):**
    *   **Jurisdiction:** The court has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). Determining eligibility for the U-visa waitlist is a mandatory assessment, not a discretionary decision specified by statute, as 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(d)(2) requires eligible petitioners to be placed on the waitlist.
    *   **Merits (Failure to State a Claim):** The plaintiff fails to state a claim for unreasonable delay. While the four-year delay is substantial and several ""TRAC test"" factors favor the plaintiff (e.g., sense of Congress for 180-day processing, human welfare interests, prejudice by delay), the D.C. Circuit precedent places significant weight on the ""competing priorities"" factor. A judicial order expediting this single application would merely shift the plaintiff ahead of thousands of other equally worthy applicants, creating more unfairness than it would remedy, and would interfere with the agency's resource allocation, which is a matter for the political branches.
3.  **Failure to Adjudicate EAD under 8 U.S.C. § 1184(p)(6) (APA & Mandamus):** The court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this claim. The statute explicitly states that ""The Secretary may grant work authorization,"" indicating a purely discretionary decision. Therefore, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) strips the court of jurisdiction to review the Secretary's handling of such discretionary EAD requests, and there is no clear duty to act required for APA or mandamus relief.
4.  **Failure to Issue Interim Work Authorization under 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) (2011) (APA & Mandamus):**
    *   **Applicable Regulation:** The 2011 version of 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) applies. It was in effect when the plaintiff filed their application in June 2016 and when the 90-day adjudication period expired in September 2016. Applying the later-effective 2017 repeal retroactively would strip the plaintiff of a vested right to interim work authorization, which is impermissible without express congressional authorization.
    *   **Jurisdiction:** The court has jurisdiction. The 2011 regulation's language (""USCIS will adjudicate... within 90 days... Failure to complete the adjudication within 90 days will result in the grant..."") creates a clear, mandatory duty for the agency to either adjudicate or issue interim EAD, making it a discrete agency action required to be taken under the APA. Judicial review is not precluded by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) as that section applies only to statutory, not regulatory, discretion.
    *   **Merits (Stated a Claim):** The plaintiff has stated a claim for agency action unlawfully withheld. The plain language of the 2011 regulation requires adjudication or issuance of interim EAD within 90 days of receipt, which the agency failed to do. The agency's interpretation that the 90-day clock begins only after a threshold determination on an underlying benefit has no support in the regulation's text and is contradicted by the agency's own reasons for repealing the rule.
5.  **Challenge to Repeal of 8 C.F.R. § 274a.13(d) (2011) without Notice-and-Comment:** This claim is dismissed. The plaintiff failed to respond to the defendants' arguments in opposition, thereby conceding the issue. Furthermore, the complaint lacked factual allegations supporting the claim, and the Federal Register documentation shows that the agency followed proper notice-and-comment procedures for the repeal.","[('usc', '8', '1571'), ('usc', '8', '1158'), ('usc', '8', '1184'), ('cfr', '8', '274'), ('usc', '8', '1252'), ('usc', '8', '1182'), ('cfr', '8', '214.14'), ('usc', '8', '1101')]","['astakhov v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'united states v.', 'sparrow v united air lines inc.', 'natl assn of mfrs. v sec', 'jerome stevens pharms. inc. v fda', 'mashpee wampanoag tribal council inc. v norton', 'landgraf v usi film prods.', 'lujan v defs. of wildlife', 'islam v heinauer', 'bowen v georgetown univ. hosp.', 'browning v clinton', 'garcia uranga v us citizenship & immigration services', 'perez v mortg. bankers assn', 'a.c.c.s. v nielsen', 'bell atl. corp. v twombly', 'kokkonen v guardian life ins. co. of am.', 'scolaro v d.c. bd. of elections & ethics', 'khan v johnson', 'jay v boyd', 'ashcroft v iqbal', 'am. natl ins. v fdic', 'gen. motors corp. v epa', 'reno v am.-arab anti-discrimination comm.', 'am. hosp. assn v burwell', 'liberty fund inc. v chao', 'herbert v natl acad. of scis.', 'schuler v united states']","[{'title': ('usc', '8', '1186'), 'chunk': ""(3) Personal interview The interview under subsection (c)(1)(B) shall be conducted within 90 days after the date of submitting a petition under subsection (c)(1)(A) and at a local office of the Department of Homeland Security, designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security, which is convenient to the parties involved The Secretary of Homeland Security, in the Secretary's discretion, may waive the deadline for an interview under subsection (c)(1)(B) or the requirement for such an interview according to criteria developed by U.S Citizenship and Immigration Services, in consultation with its Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate and U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement, provided that such criteria do not include a reduction of case processing times or the allocation of adjudicatory resources A waiver may not be granted under this subparagraph if the alien to be interviewed— (i) invested in a regional center, new commercial enterprise, or job-creating entity that was sanctioned under section 1153(b)(5) of this title; or (ii) is in a class of aliens determined by the Secretary to be threats to public safety or national security""}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1184.'), 'chunk': '(10) An amended H–1B petition shall not be required where the petitioning employer is involved in a corporate restructuring, including but not limited to a merger, acquisition, or consolidation, where a new corporate entity succeeds to the interests and obligations of the original petitioning employer and where the terms and conditions of employment remain the same but for the identity of the petitioner (11)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Secretary of State, as appropriate, shall impose a fee on an employer who has filed an attestation described in section 1182(t) of this title— (i) in order that an alien may be initially granted nonimmigrant status described in section 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b1) of this title; or (ii) in order to satisfy the requirement of the second sentence of subsection (g)(8)(C) for an alien having such status to obtain certain extensions of stay'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '283'), 'chunk': ""(a) Vote authorized In accordance with section 283c of this title, the United States Governor of the Bank is authorized to vote in favor of a resolution to increase the resources of the Fund for Special Operations up to $479,000,000, in furtherance of providing debt relief for Haiti in view of the Cancun Declaration of March 21, 2010, which provides that: (1) Haiti's debts to the Fund for Special Operations are to be cancelled; (2) Haiti's remaining local currency conversion obligations to the Fund for Special Operations are to be cancelled; (3) undisbursed balances of existing loans of the Fund for Special Operations to Haiti are to be converted to grants; and (4) the Fund for Special Operations is to make available significant and immediate grant financing to Haiti as well as appropriate resources to other countries remaining as borrowers within the Fund for Special Operations, consistent with paragraph 6 of the Cancun Declaration of March 21, 2010""}]","[{'title': 'aguilar-mendez', 'chunk': 'The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s request for voluntary departure.

2.  **Exemption 5 (Deliberative Process) Withholdings by DHS and USCIS:** The court would likely find that DHS and USCIS did not adequately justify these withholdings. The agencies' descriptions of the documents (drafts, issue papers, briefing memos, meeting topics) and their role in a deliberative process were deemed too broad and conclusory, lacking specific detail on the decision or policy involved, the nature of the deliberation, or the specific foreseeable harm disclosure would cause. The agencies would be given an opportunity to supplement their Vaughn indices with more detailed justifications or release the documents, and in camera inspection would likely be ordered given the small number of documents.
3.  **Exemptions 6 and 7(C) (Personal Privacy) Withholdings by USCIS for CBP Officer Names:** The court would find these withholdings improper. While the document (an email concerning job duties) was considered a ""similar file"" under Exemption 6, the privacy interest in the CBP officers' names was deemed de minimis, especially compared to unredacted USCIS asylum officers' names in the same document. Even if a substantial privacy interest existed, the public interest in understanding government operations, particularly given that CBP officers were instructed not to disclose their identity during interviews, would significantly outweigh it. The court would order the unredacted document to be produced.","[('usc', '8', '1225')]","['citizens for resp. and ethics in wash. v u.s. dept of just.', 'brown v dept of state', 'am. ctr. for l. & just. v u.s. dept of state', 'transgender law center v united states immigration & customs enforcement', 'mil. audit project v casey', 'ancient coin collectors guild v u.s. dept of state', 'u.s. fish and wildlife serv. v sierra club inc.', 'valencia-lucena v u.s. coast guard', 'bloche v dept of def. no. 7-cv-', 'petroleum info. corp. v u.s. dept of interior', 'dept of air force v rose', 'u.s. dept of state v wash. post co.', 'a.b.-b. v morgan', 'ctr. for investigative reporting v u.s. customs & border prot.', 'arthur andersen & co. v irs', 'pub. citizen inc. v off. of mgmt. & budget', 'meeropol v meese', 'mead data cent. inc. v u.s. dept of air force', 'national press club journalism institute v us immigration and customs enforcement', 'mapother v dept of just.', 'liberation newspaper v dept of state', 'baker & hostetler llp v u.s. dept of commerce', 'life extension found. inc. v irs', 'morley v cia', 'prison legal news v samuels', 'american immigration council v us customs and border protection', 'gray v southwest airlines inc.', 'oglesby v u.s. dept of the army', 'alyeska pipeline serv. co. v u.s. epa', 'loving v dept of def.', 'nlrb v sears roebuck & co.', 'dibacco v u.s. army', 'ctr. for pub. integrity v fed. election commn', 'multi ag media llc v dept of agric.', 'tokar v u.s. dept of just.', 'safecard servs. inc. v sec', 'defs. of wildlife v u.s. border patrol', 'nlrb v robbins tire & rubber co.', 'competitive enter. inst. v epa', 'pronin v fed. bureau of prisons', 'reps. comm. for freedom of the press v fbi', 'u.s. dept of interior v klamath water users protective assn', 'coastal states gas corp. v dept of energy', 'rosenberg v u.s. dept of def.', 'ground saucer watch inc. v cia', 'prop. of the people inc. v off. of mgmt. and budget', 'schiffer v fbi']","[{'title': ('usc', '6', '383.'), 'chunk': '(a) In general; mission There is authorized for fiscal years 2023 through 2028 within the United States Secret Service a National Computer Forensics Institute (in this section referred to as the ""Institute"") The Institute\'s mission shall be to educate, train, and equip State, local, territorial, and Tribal law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges, as well as participants in the United States Secret Service\'s network of cyber fraud task forces who are Federal employees, members of the uniformed services, or State, local, Tribal, or territorial employees, regarding the investigation and prevention of cybersecurity incidents, electronic crimes, and related cybersecurity threats, including through the dissemination of homeland security information, in accordance with relevant Federal law regarding privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties protections'}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '321'), 'chunk': '(b) Establishment The National Operations Center is the principal operations center for the Department and shall— (1) provide situational awareness and a common operating picture for the entire Federal Government, and for State, local, tribal, and territorial governments, the private sector, and international partners as appropriate, for events, threats, and incidents involving a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster; (2) ensure that critical terrorism and disaster-related information reaches government decision-makers; and (3) enter into agreements with other Federal operations centers and other homeland security partners, as appropriate, to facilitate the sharing of information'}, {'title': ('usc', '6', '1508.'), 'chunk': '(b) Contents The report required by subsection (a) shall include the following: (1) An assessment of the current intelligence sharing and cooperation relationships of the United States with other countries regarding cybersecurity threats, including cyber attacks, theft, and data breaches, directed against the United States and which threaten the United States national security interests and economy and intellectual property, specifically identifying the relative utility of such relationships, which elements of the intelligence community participate in such relationships, and whether and how such relationships could be improved'}]","[{'title': 'negusie', 'chunk': 'IV.

"A plaintiff filed a lawsuit in the District of Columbia challenging the denial of an immigrant visa petition by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The petition was processed and denied at a USCIS service center located in the Northern District of Texas, and the plaintiff resides in Maryland. The government has moved to transfer the case to either the Northern District of Texas or the District of Maryland. In which district would venue be proper for this action, and should the case be transferred there?","Venue would be proper in the Northern District of Texas, and the case should be transferred there.
An action against the federal government can be brought in any judicial district where a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred. Here, the plaintiff's Form I-140 petition was processed and denied at USCIS’s Texas Service Center, located in the Northern District of Texas, meaning a substantial part of the events occurred there. The plaintiff's argument that the events in Texas were merely a byproduct of D.C. policy decisions is rejected because the claim focuses on the application of eligibility criteria to a specific petition in Texas, not a challenge to national policy from D.C.

The case should be transferred to the Northern District of Texas based on both public and private interests.
*   **Public Interests:** The controversy is local to the Northern District of Texas, where the petition was processed and denied. Courts routinely find that cases challenging immigration petition denials should be decided where the petition was processed. The familiarity of courts with federal law is neutral, and while the Northern District of Texas is marginally more congested than the D.C. court, it does not have such enormous backlogs to prevent transfer, especially given the strong local interest.
*   **Private Interests:** The government prefers the Northern District of Texas. The claim arose in that district. Convenience to the parties, witnesses, and evidence also favors the Northern District of Texas, as any relevant witnesses or documents are most likely located there. The plaintiff's choice to litigate in D.C. receives only minimal deference because the plaintiff does not reside in D.C. and the factual allegations lack a significant nexus to D.C. officials or their specific actions.

Therefore, considering all factors, the case should be transferred to the Northern District of Texas. The transferring court found it appropriate to transfer the case without fully resolving its own subject matter jurisdiction, leaving that question for the transferee court to determine.","[('usc', '8', '1153')]","['bourdon v dhs', 'ike v united states citizenship and immigration services', 'greater yellowstone coal. v bosworth', 'relx inc. v baran', 'ravulapalli v napolitano', 'ngonga v sessions', 'gyau v sessions', 'al-ahmed v chertoff', 'van dusen v barrack', 'trout unlimited v u.s. dept of agric.', 'salha v dhs', 'fine cuts inc. v dhs', 'pac. mar. assn v nlrb', 'diaz v sessions', 'pasem v uscis', 'pub. citizen v u.s. dist. court for d.c.']","[{'title': ('usc', '22', '4714.'), 'chunk': ""No later than December 15, 1985, the Director of the United States Information Agency and the Administrator of the Agency for International Development shall report jointly, to the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, on the feasibility of greater utilization in those two agencies' scholarship and participant training programs of the United States universities in States bordering Latin American and Caribbean 1 which are located in areas characterized by the presence of sizable Hispanic populations.""}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1232.'), 'chunk': '(5) State courts acting in loco parentis A department or agency of a State, or an individual or entity appointed by a State court or juvenile court located in the United States, acting in loco parentis, shall not be considered a legal guardian for purposes of this section or section 279 of title 6'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '6472.'), 'chunk': '(2) Guidelines for refugee-processing posts in establishing agreements with United States Government-designated refugee processing entities The Attorney General and the Secretary of State shall develop and implement guidelines to ensure uniform procedures for establishing agreements with United States Government-designated refugee processing entities and personnel, and uniform procedures for such entities and personnel responsible for preparing refugee case files for use by the Immigration and Naturalization Service during refugee adjudications These procedures should ensure, to the extent practicable, that case files prepared by such entities accurately reflect information provided by the refugee applicants and that genuine refugee applicants are not disadvantaged or denied refugee status due to faulty case file preparation'}]","[{'title': 'kyong ho shin v holder', 'chunk': ""This case involves Lakshmi Injeti, a native of India.

"Under U.S. immigration law, can a foreign-born child claim citizenship through a parent who never actually resided in the U.S., by arguing that the parent constructively satisfied statutory physical presence requirements for citizenship transmission, particularly when a foreign government's actions, rather than a U.S. government error, prevented actual physical presence?","No, the court affirmed that the constructive physical presence doctrine does not apply to transmit United States citizenship under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 in such circumstances. The Act's plain language provides only limited exceptions to physical presence requirements (for military service or government employment), and courts decline to read broader equitable exceptions into the statute. The precedent allowing constructive physical presence for transmission (*Matter of Navarrete*) is specifically limited to scenarios where a U.S. government error prevented compliance with the physical presence requirements. Since no U.S. government error caused the father's inability to reside in the U.S., the doctrine does not apply.

Can the Interpol Red Notice constitute sufficient evidence to trigger the serious nonpolitical crime bar, and how would the court assess the ""seriousness"" of such a crime for purposes of asylum and withholding eligibility?","Yes, an Interpol Red Notice may constitute reliable evidence indicating that the serious nonpolitical crime bar for asylum and withholding of removal applies to an alien. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can meet its burden to shift the burden of proof to the alien by presenting ""some evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that one or more grounds for mandatory denial of the application for relief may apply,"" which an Interpol Red Notice, corroborated by other evidence like a Form I-213, can satisfy. An Interpol Red Notice is considered reliable for what it purports to be: a request by a member country for provisional arrest based on a valid national arrest warrant for a serious ordinary law crime.

Once the burden shifts, the alien must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the serious nonpolitical crime bar does not apply. Regarding the ""seriousness"" of the crime, a violation of Article 345 of the Salvadoran Penal Code, which criminalizes participation in an illicit organization whose purpose is the commission of crimes and uses violent means, is considered ""serious."" This assessment takes into account whether the conduct involved a substantial risk of violence and harm to persons and the maximum term of imprisonment (e.g., up to 9 years for Article 345). The Board does not need to explicitly consider the atrociousness of the acts in every case to determine that a crime is serious.","[('usc', '8', '1229'), ('usc', '8', '1182'), ('cfr', '8', '1208.16'), ('usc', '8', '208'), ('cfr', '8', '1240.8')]","['guan v barr', 'zheng v holder', 'tatintsyan v barr', 'khouzam v ashcroft', 'marroquin-retana v atty gen. u.s.', 'ins v aguirre-aguirre', 'barapind v enomoto', 'go v holder', 'w-e-r-b', 'united states v mohamud']","[{'title': ('usc', '22', '8561.'), 'chunk': '(24) In 1980, Ali Akbar Tabatabaei, a leading critic of Iran and then president of the Iran Freedom Foundation, was murdered in front of his Bethesda, Maryland, home by an assassin disguised as a postal courier The Federal Bureau of Investigation had identified the ""mailman"" as Dawud Salahuddin, born David Theodore Belfield Mr Salahuddin was working as a security guard at an Iranian interest office in Washington, DC, when he claims he accepted the assignment and payment of $5,000 from the Government of Iran to kill Mr Tabatabaei'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '8561.'), 'chunk': '(10) In 2020, a United States-Iranian citizen and an Iranian resident of California pleaded guilty to charges of acting as illegal agents of the Government of Iran by surveilling Jewish student facilities, including the Hillel Center and Rohr Chabad Center at the University of Chicago, in addition to surveilling and collecting identifying information about United States citizens and nationals who are critical of the Iranian regime'}, {'title': ('usc', '22', '2429'), 'chunk': '(a) Policy It is the sense of the Congress that the President should instruct the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to enhance the role of that institution in the enforcement of nonproliferation treaties through the passage of a United Nations Security Council resolution which would state that, any non-nuclear weapon state that is found by the United Nations Security Council, in consultation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to have terminated, abrogated, or materially violated an IAEA full-scope safeguards agreement would be subjected to international economic sanctions, the scope of which to be determined by the United Nations Security Council'}]","[{'title': 'munoz-de zelaya v garland', 'chunk': 'The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the petition for review in the immigration case Munoz-De Zelaya v.

"An individual in removal proceedings, a native and citizen of Cameroon, seeks review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) decision. The BIA affirmed an immigration judge's (IJ) denial of a motion to continue removal proceedings to await adjudication of a relative's I-130 petition. Additionally, the BIA denied a motion to remand the case to the IJ after the I-130 petition was approved, so the individual could pursue adjustment of status. The IJ had previously denied the continuance motion for failure to show good cause, citing untimeliness and lack of diligence in pursuing the I-130 petition. Does the Court of Appeals have jurisdiction to review the BIA's affirmance of the continuance denial, and did the BIA abuse its discretion in denying the motion to remand?","The Court of Appeals does not have jurisdiction to review the BIA's continuance determination because the ""good cause"" standard for a continuance, unlike an ""exceptional and extremely unusual hardship"" standard, has discretion baked into it and does not involve a reviewable application of a legal standard under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D). Therefore, the petition for review regarding the continuance denial is dismissed. Regarding the motion to remand, the BIA did not abuse its discretion. It was ""perceptibl[y rational"" for the BIA to determine that the individual failed to show due diligence in pursuing adjustment of status through his daughter, as she filed her I-130 petition nearly a year after becoming eligible to do so, and counsel helped ""quickly put together"" the petition only after marital difficulties arose. Therefore, the petition for review regarding the denial of the motion to remand is denied.","[('usc', '8', '1229'), ('usc', '8', '8'), ('cfr', '8', '1003.29'), ('usc', '8', '1252'), ('cfr', '8', '1003.2')]","['green valley special util. dist. v city of schertz', 'wilkinson v garland', 'manzano-garcia v gonzales', 'suate-orellana v barr', 'united states v swanson', 'cuenca-arroyo v garland', 'patel v garland', 'guerrero-lasprilla v barr', 'perez v garland', 'steel co. v citizens for a better envt', 'ikome v bondi', 'milat v holder', 'zhao v gonzales']","[{'title': ('usc', '8', '1184.'), 'chunk': ""(3) As a condition for the admission, and continued stay in lawful status, of such a nonimmigrant, the nonimmigrant— (A) shall report not less often than quarterly to the Attorney General such information concerning the alien's whereabouts and activities as the Attorney General may require; (B) may not be convicted of any criminal offense punishable by a term of imprisonment of 1 year or more after the date of such admission; (C) must have executed a form that waives the nonimmigrant's right to contest, other than on the basis of an application for withholding of removal, any action for removal of the alien instituted before the alien obtains lawful permanent resident status; and (D) shall abide by any other condition, limitation, or restriction imposed by the Attorney General""}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1252.'), 'chunk': '(g) Exclusive jurisdiction Except as provided in this section and notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), including section 2241 of title 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 and 1651 of such title, no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.'}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1154.'), 'chunk': '(l) Surviving relative consideration for certain petitions and applications (1) In general An alien described in paragraph (2) who resided in the United States at the time of the death of the qualifying relative and who continues to reside in the United States shall have such petition described in paragraph (2), or an application for adjustment of status to that of a person admitted for lawful permanent residence based upon the family relationship described in paragraph (2), and any related applications, adjudicated notwithstanding the death of the qualifying relative, unless the Secretary of Homeland Security determines, in the unreviewable discretion of the Secretary, that approval would not be in the public interest'}]","[{'title': 'ruiz-perez v garland', 'chunk': ""The court considered the case of Samuel De Jesus Argueta-Hernandez, who sought review of the Board of Immigration Appeals’ (BIA) denial of his application for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).

"An alien was apprehended after illegal entry and provided an address to immigration officials. The address was deficient, leading to returned mail and the alien's in absentia removal. Eighteen years later, the alien moves to reopen removal proceedings, asserting that a different, correct address was initially provided and that the immigration officer made an error, thus entitling the alien to notice. The alien further argues that the original Notice to Appear (NTA) was defective for failing to specify the date and time of the hearing, making them eligible for cancellation of removal, particularly in light of subsequent Supreme Court precedent that clarified the ""stop-time rule."" How should a court rule on the alien's motion to reopen and claim of eligibility for cancellation of removal?","The court would deny the petition for review. Regarding the motion to reopen removal proceedings and rescind the in absentia removal order, the immigration judge (IJ) rejected the alien's affidavit testimony as untrustworthy and found that the alien provided a deficient address. Substantial evidence supports this factual finding, meaning the alien failed to provide an address at which they could be contacted, thus forfeiting their right to notice. An alien who forfeits their right to notice by failing to provide a viable mailing address cannot seek to reopen the removal proceedings and rescind the in absentia removal order for lack of notice. Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in affirming the IJ's decision. Regarding the alien's claim of eligibility for cancellation of removal, the alien failed to analyze this theory in a meaningful way in their opening brief, and thus the argument is forfeited. It is of no consequence that then-valid circuit precedent foreclosed the cancellation argument at the time the opening brief was submitted, as the argument was nonetheless available to the alien.","[('usc', '8', '1229'), ('usc', '8', '1182')]","['hernandez-castillo v sessions', 'mauricio-benitez v sessions', 'gomez-palacios v holder', 'perez-sanchez v u.s. atty gen.', 'ortiz-santiago v barr', 'spagnol-bastos v garland', 'niz-chavez v garland', 'rodriguez v garland', 'pereira v sessions', 'edwards v johnson']","[{'title': ('usc', '8', '1252'), 'chunk': '(a) In general Notwithstanding any other provision of law, to the extent permitted by relevant State and local law, State and local law enforcement officials are authorized to arrest and detain an individual who— (1) is an alien illegally present in the United States; and (2) has previously been convicted of a felony in the United States and deported or left the United States after such conviction, (b) Cooperation The Attorney General shall cooperate with the States to assure that information in the control of the Attorney General, including information in the National Crime Information Center, that would assist State and local law enforcement officials in carrying out duties under subsection (a) is made available to such officials.'}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1184.'), 'chunk': ""(3) As a condition for the admission, and continued stay in lawful status, of such a nonimmigrant, the nonimmigrant— (A) shall report not less often than quarterly to the Attorney General such information concerning the alien's whereabouts and activities as the Attorney General may require; (B) may not be convicted of any criminal offense punishable by a term of imprisonment of 1 year or more after the date of such admission; (C) must have executed a form that waives the nonimmigrant's right to contest, other than on the basis of an application for withholding of removal, any action for removal of the alien instituted before the alien obtains lawful permanent resident status; and (D) shall abide by any other condition, limitation, or restriction imposed by the Attorney General""}, {'title': ('usc', '8', '1231.'), 'chunk': ""(3) Supervision after 90-day period If the alien does not leave or is not removed within the removal period, the alien, pending removal, shall be subject to supervision under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General The regulations shall include provisions requiring the alien— (A) to appear before an immigration officer periodically for identification; (B) to submit, if necessary, to a medical and psychiatric examination at the expense of the United States Government; (C) to give information under oath about the alien's nationality, circumstances, habits, associations, and activities, and other information the Attorney General considers appropriate; and (D) to obey reasonable written restrictions on the alien's conduct or activities that the Attorney General prescribes for the alien""}]","[{'title': 'aguilar-mendez', 'chunk': 'The Immigration Judge also denied the respondent’s request for voluntary departure.
