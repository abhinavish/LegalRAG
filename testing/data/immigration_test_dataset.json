{"case_name": "wang v. united states citizenship and immigration services", "question": "An individual applies for an EB-5 immigrant investor visa, investing $500,000 in a U.S. business within a targeted employment area. The invested capital consists entirely of proceeds from a loan secured by property owned jointly by the investor and a third party. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) denies the petition, classifying the loan proceeds as \"indebtedness\" under 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e) and asserting the investor failed to meet collateralization requirements due to insufficient personal ownership of the securing asset. Is USCIS's classification of loan proceeds as \"indebtedness\" consistent with the regulation, and is such a denial lawful?", "golden_answer": "No, USCIS's classification of loan proceeds as \"indebtedness\" is plainly erroneous and inconsistent with the regulation. The court ruled that proceeds from a loan are \"cash,\" not \"indebtedness.\" \"Indebtedness\" refers to the condition of owing money, such as a promissory note or an immigrant investor's promise to pay a new commercial enterprise later, not the immediate cash proceeds a debtor receives from acquiring a debt. Cash, even if obtained from a loan, is still considered \"cash\" under the regulation and does not require the same collateralization as \"indebtedness.\" USCIS's denial was arbitrary and capricious, and the case will be remanded for reconsideration consistent with this interpretation.", "golden_context": ["8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(5)", "8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(5)(C)(i)", "8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(5)(C)(ii)", "8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)", "8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e)", "8 C.F.R. § 204.6(f)(2)", "8 C.F.R. § 204.6(j)(2)", "8 C.F.R. § 204.6(j)(3)"], "golden_case_context": ["wang v. united states citizenship and immigration services", "wang v. uscis", "richards v. i.n.s.", "ramaprakash v. fed. aviation admin.", "chang v. uscis", "fund for animals v. babbitt", "christopher v. smithkline beecham corp.", "chase bank usa v. mccoy", "kisor v. wilkie", "bowen v. georgetown univ. hosp.", "zhang v. uscis", "ftc v. tarriff", "williams v. taylor", "fla. power & light co. v. lorion"]}

While the Eastern District of Virginia is also a proper venue (where the plaintiff resides and where the applications were filed), the court granted the plaintiff's request to transfer to Maryland due to the inconvenience to the plaintiff of litigating in Virginia (his current counsel is barred in D.C. and Maryland but not in Virginia) and the lack of objection from the government to defending the case in Maryland (where USCIS's headquarters are located).", "golden_context": ["8 U.S.C. § 1158"], "golden_case_context": ["farroukh v. united states citizenship & immigration services", "ike v. uscis", "pasem v. uscis", "bourdon v. u.s. dept of homeland sec.", "barrera v. u.s. dept of homeland sec.", "roh v. uscis", "alahmed v. chertoff", "wolfram alpha llc v. cuccinelli", "natl assn of home builders v. epa", "miller v. insulation contractors, inc."]}

If USCIS argues that its \"visa availability approach\" for processing petitions is an identifiable rationale, and that expediting one petition would simply delay others, will the court likely grant the individual's request to compel adjudication?", "golden_answer": "No, the court will likely deny the request to compel adjudication. Based on an analysis of the \"TRAC factors,\" the court found that USCIS's \"visa availability approach\" adhered to an identifiable rationale (TRAC factor one), and that there was no binding congressional timeline for processing I-526 petitions (TRAC factor two, only slightly favoring the plaintiff due to an aspirational 180-day processing goal). While the plaintiff experienced economic harm and uncertainty, these were not deemed sufficient to weigh TRAC factors three and five (human health and welfare, and interests prejudiced by delay) in their favor, as such harms are considered economic and inherent in the immigration process. Most significantly, TRAC factor four, concerning the effect of expediting delayed action on agency activities of higher or competing priority, weighed against the plaintiff because compelling adjudication would merely move them ahead in the queue, displacing other similarly situated applicants and interfering with the agency's resource allocation. The court also found no plausible allegations of agency impropriety (TRAC factor six).

Plaintiff's counsel, acting as monitors, observe that the new AORW form still asks for the \"number of days the age-out was in ORR custody\" and does not explicitly list \"release to a sponsor, ICE ATD, or ICE bond\" as mitigating factors for flight risk. Furthermore, they propose that ICE should provide explanations for rejecting any proposed organizational sponsors and that their ongoing monitoring work should be compensated at the higher Laffey Matrix rate. How should the court rule on these specific challenges and requests from Plaintiff's counsel?", "golden_answer": "The court will grant the motion for permanent injunction, mandating specific revisions to ICE's Age-Out Review Worksheet (AORW) and defining the scope of monitoring compensation. The court will order ICE to remove the question concerning the \"number of days the age-out was in ORR custody\" from the AORW, as ICE historically used this factor to reach improper conclusions without providing a proper justification for its retention. Additionally, the court will require ICE to include recognized mitigating factors for flight risk, such as release to a sponsor, release on ICE ATD, or release on ICE bond, as part of the flight risk analysis in the AORW form.\n\nHowever, the court will decline to impose a requirement that ICE provide explanations for rejecting proposed organizational sponsors or maintain office-specific lists of such sponsors. These measures are not deemed \"essential remedies\" for past non-compliance, and imposing them would infringe upon ICE's discretion in determining how best to fulfill its statutory obligations, particularly concerning the allocation of scarce resources. The court will also not require advance notice, review, or objection rights for Plaintiffs regarding revisions to ICE's policy guidance and training materials, deeming it too intrusive without further extensive misconduct.\n\nRegarding compensation for Plaintiffs' counsel's monitoring duties, the court will affirm their entitlement to reasonable compensation for this role, which serves to enforce compliance with the final order. However, this compensation will be calculated at the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) rate, capped at $125 per hour plus cost of living or special factor adjustments, rather than the higher Laffey Matrix rate, as there is no precedent for applying the Laffey Matrix to EAJA post-judgment monitoring without enhanced fees.

In such a scenario, even if a \"sense of Congress\" resolution suggests a 180-day processing goal (tipping the second TRAC factor in the plaintiff's favor), the court may find the delay reasonable if: (1) the agency's processing approach (like prioritizing petitions based on visa availability and then using a \"first-in, first-out\" method) provides an identifiable \"rule of reason\" (first factor); (2) expediting the plaintiff's petition would merely move them ahead of other similarly situated applicants, thus interfering with the agency's competing priorities and resources (fourth factor); and (3) the alleged harm is primarily economic, rather than to human health and welfare (third and fifth factors).

The court dismissed the Olofins' suit, finding that USCIS had not unreasonably delayed in adjudicating their Form I-526 application.

The effective 30-month delay was also found not unreasonable in comparison to precedents. The fourth factor, concerning the effect of expediting delayed action on higher or competing priorities, weighed strongly in favor of USCIS, as granting the requested relief would unfairly reorder agency priorities and prejudice other similarly situated applicants.

The court would consider the agency's established \"first-in, first-out\" processing approach, which factors in visa availability and whether the project has been reviewed, as a \"rule of reason.\" A non-binding \"sense of Congress\" regarding a 180-day processing deadline is not sufficient to deem a longer wait unreasonable as a matter of law, especially when delays are typically found unreasonable only after five, six, or seven years, and not for waits between three to five years (or less). Furthermore, if granting relief would merely move the plaintiff to the head of the line at the expense of other petitioners, the \"competing priorities\" factor weighs against relief. Personal and economic hardships, such as the risk of an investment project losing funds or the inability to reside or be employed in the U.S., are generally considered inherent to the adjudication process and are not severe enough to favor the plaintiff, unlike cases involving prolonged separation of spouses or diminished quality of life due to mental health disorders. Lastly, a lack of plausible allegations of bad faith by the agency would not alter the court's analysis.

{"case_name": "garcia v. us citizenship and immigration services", "question": "A non-citizen filed an application for lawful permanent resident (LPR) status in 1995. The application was never formally adjudicated, but the non-citizen later obtained LPR status in 2000 through a separate application, with that status retroactively applied to 1996. In 2005, the non-citizen was convicted of a serious felony and subsequently ordered deportable, losing LPR status. Now, in 2024, facing imminent deportation, the non-citizen discovers the unadjudicated 1995 application and seeks a court order to compel the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to adjudicate it under the laws and facts as they existed in 1995. If granted, this would mean their LPR status would pre-date their felony conviction, potentially allowing them to apply for a discretionary waiver from deportation that existed in 1995 but was repealed in 1996. Does the non-citizen have standing to compel USCIS to adjudicate the 1995 application with such retroactive effect?", "golden_answer": "No, the non-citizen likely lacks standing. The court would consider the justiciability of the claim as one of standing, not mootness, because the prior LPR status adjudication and subsequent events predated the current lawsuit. To establish standing, the non-citizen must demonstrate a redressable injury. However, the requested relief—adjudication of the 1995 application as if it were 1995—is too speculative to redress the ultimate injury of deportation. There is no guarantee that USCIS would grant LPR status even if compelled to adjudicate the 1995 application, given that LPR status grants are discretionary and the non-citizen would need to be eligible at the time of adjudication (today) under current laws. Furthermore, even if LPR status were granted retroactively, the discretionary waiver from deportation that the non-citizen seeks was repealed in 1996. The court would likely doubt its authority to grant such broad *nunc pro tunc* equitable relief (rewinding both law and facts by decades) in an immigration context. Even if such a remedy were available, the equities would weigh strongly against granting it, especially if the non-citizen had previously engaged in fraudulent conduct or delayed in pursuing the claim, and because such an order would not \"effect a complete disposition\" of the case by guaranteeing the discretionary waiver.

Private interests also favor transfer due to where the claim arose, the defendant's preferred forum, and the convenience of potential witnesses and evidence, which are most likely to reside in Texas.

{"case_name": "manzoor v. united states citizenship and immigration services", "question": "A U.S. lawful permanent resident, whose spouse lives abroad, filed a Form I-130 visa petition on behalf of their spouse. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) approved the petition and transferred it to the National Visa Center (NVC) for further processing. Due to a global pandemic, the State Department experienced significant backlogs and delays in processing visa applications and conducting interviews, resulting in a processing time of less than two years at the NVC. The resident is suffering mental and physical health tolls due to the separation from their spouse and believes the delay is unreasonable, a violation of their due process rights, and that the \"Controlled Application Review and Resolution Program\" (CARRP) policy is unlawful. The resident files a lawsuit against USCIS (part of DHS) and the State Department, seeking to compel faster processing and declare CARRP unlawful. What is the likely outcome of this lawsuit based on the provided case?", "golden_answer": "Based on the provided case, the lawsuit would likely be dismissed.\nFirst, the claims against USCIS (DHS) would be dismissed as moot because USCIS completed its processing by approving and transferring the Form I-130 petition to the NVC. Once an agency has accorded all relief it can in a visa case, claims against that agency are moot.\nSecond, the claims against the State Department would be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n*   **Administrative Procedure Act (APA) Claim for Unreasonable Delay:** The court would find that a delay of less than two years, especially amidst a global pandemic that caused an extraordinary backlog and disruption of visa services, is not unreasonable. Courts in this jurisdiction regularly find that processing applications in the order they were filed constitutes a \"rule of reason.\" Expediting this specific application would merely force the State Department to put the plaintiff ahead of others similarly situated, which is inappropriate without compelling circumstances. Furthermore, the court would defer to the State Department’s priority-setting during the pandemic. The plaintiff's broad allegations of physical and mental health tolls due to family separation are generally deemed insufficient to establish that human health and welfare are at stake or that other interests are prejudiced, particularly when the court does not find impropriety.\n*   **Due Process Claim (Procedural and Substantive):** The court would dismiss these claims because there is no fundamental liberty interest in having a noncitizen spouse's visa application granted or approved at a quicker pace. An alien seeking admission to the U.S. does so as a privilege, not a right. Without a protected liberty or property interest in an immigrant visa, and with a process governed by a rule of reason, neither a substantive nor a procedural due process violation can be established.\n*   **CARRP Claims:** These claims would be dismissed because CARRP is a policy of DHS, not the State Department. With the DHS defendants dismissed on jurisdictional grounds (mootness or ripeness), any retrospective claim against DHS regarding CARRP is moot, and any prospective claim is constitutionally unripe.", "golden_context": ["8 C.F.R. § 204.1(a)(1)", "8 C.F.R. § 204.2(a)(3)", "22 C.F.R. § 42.67(a)", "22 C.F.R. § 42.67(a)(1)", "22 C.F.R. § 42.67(a)(3)", "22 C.F.R. § 42.81(a)"], "golden_case_context": ["manzoor v. united states citizenship and immigration services", "jafarzadeh v. duke", "lujan v. defenders of wildlife", "bagherian v. pompeo", "coal. for underground expansion v. mineta", "herbert v. natl acad. of scis.", "settles v. u.s. parole commn", "koutny v. martin", "grand lodge of fraternal order of police v. ashcroft", "trudeau v. fed. trade commn", "papasan v. allain", "ashcroft v. iqbal", "bell atl. corp. v. twombly", "natl postal profl nurses v. u.s. postal serv.", "ward v. d.c. dept of youth rehab. servs.", "gustave–schmidt v. chao", "hinton v. corr. corp. of am.", "abhe & svoboda, inc. v. chao", "haider v. united states dept of homeland sec.", "jingjing v. mayorkas", "telecommunications research & action center v. fcc (trac)", "mashpee wampanoag tribal council, inc. v. norton", "ctr. for sci. in the pub. interest v. fda", "palakuru v. renaud", "muvvala v. wolf", "xiaobing v. blinken", "ghadami v. united states dept of homeland sec.", "skalka v. kelly", "fangfang v. cissna", "yavari v. pompeo", "ren v. mueller", "nibber v. u.s. citizenship & immigr. servs.", "desai v. uscis", "tate v. pompeo", "thakker v. renaud", "nohria v. renaud", "kangarloo v. pompeo", "obergefell v. hodges", "washington v. glucksberg", "moore v. city of e. cleveland", "u.s. ex rel. knauff v. shaughnessy", "kerry v. din", "colindres v. u.s. dept of state", "mahmood v. dhs", "smirnov v. clinton", "mathews v. eldridge"]}

The District Court dismissed the claims, finding that the termination was not a \"final agency action\" because reinstatement proceedings were pending and the case was not \"ripe\" for judicial review. Based on the case ruling, should the appellate court agree with the District Court's dismissal?", "golden_answer": "No, the appellate court should not agree with the District Court's dismissal. The termination of the students' F-1 visas constituted a \"final agency action\" for purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act because it marked the consummation of the agency's decision-making process and determined their legal status. There is no statutory or regulatory requirement for students to seek reinstatement as a form of review, and reinstatement proceedings do not provide a mechanism to review the original termination order or the propriety of the \"fraudulent enrollment\" determination. Furthermore, uninitiated removal proceedings cannot be a prerequisite to finality, as they may never occur, and immigration judges or the Board of Immigration Appeals lack the authority to review a denial of reinstatement. Therefore, the order terminating the students' F-1 visa status was final, and the District Court erred in concluding otherwise. Additionally, the case is ripe for review because the parties are adversarial, the students are genuinely aggrieved by the loss of their status and the notation of fraud on their records, and the issues will not become more crystallized without judicial intervention, especially given the Government's shifting position on the students' culpability.", "golden_context": ["8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(F)", "8 C.F.R. § 214.3", "8 C.F.R. § 214.4(b)", "8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)", "8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(6)", "8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(10)(i)", "8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(10)(ii)", "8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(1)(i)", "8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(1)(ii)", "8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(5)(iv)", "8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B) and (C)(i)", "8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(16)(i)(A)–(F)", "8 C.F.R. § 214.2(f)(16)(ii)", "8 C.F.R. § 214.1(d)", "8 U.S.C. § 1201(i)", "8 U.S.C. § 1101 et seq.", "8 C.F.R. § 208.14(c)(1)"], "golden_case_context": ["jie fang v. dir us immigration & customs enforcement", "palakovic v. wetzel", "marathon petroleum corp. v. secy of finance", "bennett v. spear", "pinho v. gonzales", "darby v. cisneros", "cabaccang v. uscis", "hosseini v. johnson", "fang v. homan", "ftc v. standard oil co. of cal.", "qureshi v. holder", "kashani v. nelson", "laoye v. attorney general", "young dong kim v. holder", "ghorbani v. ins", "tooloee v. ins", "felmeister v. office of attorney ethics", "peachlum v. city of york", "babbitt v. united farm workers natl union"]}

The court ruled that binding precedent establishes an agency need not respond to requests that entail an unduly burdensome effort of review, redaction, and production. In this case, the request for \"all electronic records sent or received by\" three high-ranking officials over nine months yielded over 1.6 million pages and an estimated 8,151 hours (about two years and nine months) of processing time. The court found this burden to be \"too high,\" especially given that much of the material would be irrelevant to the requester's stated purpose and the transfer of such large files could severely degrade IT operations.

The company argues that the D.C. court is a proper venue because USCIS headquarters are in D.C. and the denials reflect an agency-wide policy shift. Defendants move to transfer the case to the District of Nebraska or North Dakota. Should the case be transferred?", "golden_answer": "Yes, the case should be transferred to the District of Nebraska. The court determined that while the District of Columbia is a proper venue because USCIS is headquartered there, the locus of the controversy lies in Nebraska. The private interest factors weigh in favor of transfer because the plaintiff is not a resident of D.C., and there is no meaningful nexus between the lawsuit and D.C., as the challenged denials occurred in Nebraska. The argument that the case involves an agency-wide policy shift is not supported by a reasonable inference, as the dispute is with the implementation of the policy by the Nebraska Service Center rather than a broad challenge to nationwide policies. The administrative record is in Nebraska, and potential witnesses are Nebraska-based NSC employees. Public interest factors also favor Nebraska, as both districts are equally familiar with federal law, court congestion statistics are mixed, but Nebraska has a stronger local interest in the case since the suit arises from NSC's denials and seeks relief compelling NSC to approve the applications.", "golden_context": ["8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)", "8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(3)(A)(iii)", "8 C.F.R. § 204.5(g)(2)"], "golden_case_context": ["psv enterprises llc v. united states citizenship and immigration services", "george v. napolitano", "ravulapalli v. napolitano", "w. watersheds project v. tidwell", "stewart org., inc. v. ricoh corp.", "wolfram alpha llc v. cuccinelli", "pengbo li v. miller", "fed. hous. fin. agency v. first tenn. bank natl assn", "aftab v. gonzalez", "efficientip, inc. v. cuccinelli", "cameron v. thornburgh", "abusadeh v. chertoff", "bourdon v. u.s. dept of homeland sec.", "ngonga v. sessions", "aishat v. u.s. dept of homeland sec."]}

The applicant seeks to challenge the revocation in U.S. District Court, arguing: (1) USCIS's regulations and filing requirements, which only permit physical mail and prevent same-day electronic or hand delivery, are unreasonable; (2) the 16-month delay between approval and revocation was unreasonable; and (3) USCIS's disparate treatment of SIJ applicants by not allowing electronic filing, while offering it for other petition types, violates constitutional equal protection and due process. Based on the *Cabrera Cabrera* decision, which of these claims would a District Court likely have jurisdiction to review?", "golden_answer": "A U.S. District Court would likely have jurisdiction to review the applicant's challenge to the reasonableness of USCIS's regulations on filing petitions seeking special immigrant juvenile status and the implementation of those regulations, specifically concerning the inability to file electronically or by hand. The court found that the authority for these regulations stems from Subchapter I of Title 8 (8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)(3)), which is not subject to the jurisdiction-stripping clause in Subchapter II (8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)).\n\nHowever, the District Court would likely *lack* jurisdiction to review the claim that the 16-month delay between approval and revocation was unreasonable. This is because 8 U.S.C. § 1155 grants the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion to revoke a petition \"at any time,\" meaning Congress placed no time limitation on such actions, thus falling within the scope of the jurisdiction-stripping clause.\n\nFurthermore, the District Court would also *lack* jurisdiction to consider the constitutional claims (Equal Protection and Due Process) regarding the inability to file electronically.

{"case_name": "doe v. united states immigration and customs enforcement", "question": "An agency, responding to a FOIA request, withholds several documents under the deliberative-process and attorney-client privileges. For the deliberative-process privilege, it states that disclosure would discourage free and frank discussion, potentially confuse the public, and harm the privilege itself, using identical boilerplate language for most documents in its declaration and Vaughn index. For the attorney-client privilege, it asserts that documents requesting legal advice are privileged because they are confidential communications from staff to attorneys seeking advice. For documents providing legal advice from attorneys to the agency, it generally claims they contain confidential legal advice and were not disclosed to third parties, but does not specifically detail that the advice was based on confidential client disclosures. Furthermore, for all attorney-client withholdings, it broadly asserts that disclosure would chill interactions between agency employees and legal counsel without specific linking to the documents. Has the agency properly justified its withholdings under FOIA Exemption 5 and the foreseeable harm requirement?", "golden_answer": "No, the agency has not properly justified all its withholdings. The court found that for the deliberative-process privilege, the agency failed to meet its burden of showing a reasonably foreseeable harm from disclosure. Its declarations and Vaughn index used boilerplate, generic, conclusory, and speculative statements that did not articulate the link between the specified harm (chilling communications, public confusion, harm to the privilege itself) and the specific information withheld, nor did they provide a focused and concrete demonstration of actual harm. While the agency did show that documents where staff explicitly requested legal advice from attorneys were at least partially covered by the attorney-client privilege, it failed to demonstrate that the documents providing legal advice from attorneys to the agency were privileged. This was because it did not show that the attorneys' communications rested in significant and inseparable part on the client's confidential disclosure, relying instead on conclusory assertions and insufficient Vaughn index entries regarding confidentiality. Moreover, for all documents withheld under the attorney-client privilege, the agency failed to adequately show a reasonably foreseeable harm from disclosure, offering only unadorned and broad categorical claims about chilling future communications, which were deemed insufficient. Therefore, the court denied both parties' motions for summary judgment without prejudice, providing the agency another opportunity to submit a more detailed declaration or updated Vaughn index to justify its withholdings.", "golden_context": ["8 C.F.R. § 208.6(a)"], "golden_case_context": ["doe v. united states immigration and customs enforcement", "lopez v. council on am.islamic rels. action network, inc., 826 f.3d 492, 496 (d.c. cir. 2016)", "macleod v. dhs, no. 15cv1792, 2017 wl 4220398, at *6 (d.d.c. sept. 21, 2017)", "cable news network, inc. v. fbi, 271 f. supp. 3d 108, 111 (d.d.c. 2017)", "king v. doj, 245 f. supp. 3d 153, 158 (d.d.c. 2017)", "emuwa v. dhs, 113 f.4th 1009, 1012 (d.c. cir. 2024)", "dalal v. doj, 643 f. supp. 3d 33, 59 (d.d.c. 2022)", "am. immigr. council v. dhs, 21 f. supp. 3d 60, 74 (d.d.c. 2014)", "reps. comm. for freedom of the press v. fbi, 3 f.4th 350, 369 (d.c. cir. 2021)", "nlrb v. sears, roebuck & co., 421 u.s. 132, 150 (1975)", "machado amadis v. u.s. dept of state, 971 f.3d 364, 371 (d.c. cir. 2020)", "u.s. fish & wildlife serv. v. sierra club, inc., 592 u.s. 261, 268 (2021)", "senate of the commonwealth of puerto rico ex rel. judiciary comm. v. doj, 823 f.2d 574, 585 (d.c. cir. 1987)", "campaign legal ctr. v. doj, 34 f.4th 14, 23 (d.c. cir. 2022)", "citizens for resp. & ethics in wash. v. doj, 45 f.4th 963, 972 (d.c. cir. 2022)", "natl sec. couns. v. cia, 960 f. supp. 2d 101, 190 (d.d.c. 2013)", "coastal states gas corp. v. dept of energy, 617 f.2d 854, 868 (d.c. cir. 1980)", "am. oversight v. dhs, 691 f. supp. 3d 109, 117 (d.d.c. 2023)", "transgender l. ctr. v. ice, 775 f. supp. 3d 131, 152–53 (d.d.c. 2025)", "reps. comm. for freedom of the press v. cbp, 567 f. supp. 3d 97, 120 (d.d.c. 2021)", "tax analysts v. irs, 117 f.3d 607, 618 (d.c. cir. 1997)", "upjohn co. v. united states, 449 u.s. 383, 389 (1981)", "citizens for resp. & ethics in wash. v. doj, 538 f. supp. 3d 124, 135 (d.d.c. 2021), affd, 45 f.4th 963 (d.c. cir. 2022)", "mead data cent., inc. v. u.s. dept of air force, 566 f.2d 242, 253 (d.c. cir. 1977)", "zander v. doj, 885 f. supp. 2d 1, 16 (d.d.c. 2012), on reconsideration in part (oct. 31, 2012)", "jud. watch, inc. v. usps, 297 f. supp. 2d 252, 268 (d.d.c. 2004)", "aclu v. dhs, 738 f. supp. 2d 93, 115 (d.d.c. 2010)", "hornbeck offshore transp., llc v. u.s. coast guard, no. 04cv1724, 2006 wl 696053, at *16 (d.d.c. mar. 20, 2006)", "blade v. u.s. dept of labor, no. 20cv2591, 2024 wl 4664453, at *32–34 (d.d.c. nov. 4, 2024)", "ams. for fair treatment v. usps, 663 f. supp. 3d 39, 62 (d.d.c. 2023)"]}

Regarding the Administrative Procedure Act claim, a two-year delay in scheduling an interview, particularly during a global pandemic, is not considered unreasonable as a matter of law, especially since Congress has not set a specific timeline for visa processing. The court would weigh various factors, noting that the delay does not involve immediate human health or welfare risks, and expediting this applicant's case would merely reorder the queue for other applicants facing similar delays due to the pandemic. As for the Fifth Amendment Due Process claim, a non-resident, non-citizen seeking initial entry to the United States has no constitutional rights regarding their visa application; the power to admit or exclude noncitizens is a sovereign prerogative, and the statutory procedure provided is considered due process in this context.", "golden_context": ["8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 et seq.", "8 U.S.C. § 1202"], "golden_case_context": ["khushnood v. united states citizenship and immigration services", "bell atlantic corp. v. twombly", "ashcroft v. iqbal", "sparrow v. united air lines, inc.", "kowal v. mci commcns corp.", "scheuer v. rhodes", "conservation force, inc. v. jewell", "iron arrow honor socy v. heckler", "khanom v. kerry", "baan rao thai rest. v. pompeo", "bagherian v. pompeo", "telecommunications research and action center (trac) v. federal communications commission", "palakuru v. renaud", "sarlak v. pompeo", "legal assistance for vietnamese asylum seekers v. dept of state", "skalka v. kelly", "ghadami v. dept of homeland sec.", "mahmood v. dept of homeland sec.", "dastagir v. blinken", "oil, chemical and atomic workers intern. union v. zegeer", "hulli v. mayorkas", "mashpee wampanoag tribal council, inc. v. norton", "dept of homeland sec. v. thuraissigiam", "nishimura ekiu v. united states", "united states ex rel. knauff v. shaughnessy", "shaughnessy v. united states ex rel. mezei", "landon v. plasencia", "new vision photography program, inc. v. district of columbia", "tate v. pompeo"]}

For Ms. Thatikonda, the motion for a preliminary injunction was deemed moot because her H-1B petition was approved by USCIS. For Mr. Venkatraman, the motion was granted in part. The court found that he was very likely to succeed on the merits because USCIS's denial was based on an invalid \"non-speculative work requirement,\" a policy that another court in the same district had recently found to be erroneous and outside statutory authority. This made USCIS's decision arbitrary and capricious. Mr. Venkatraman also demonstrated irreparable harm due to the loss of lawful immigration status, subjecting him to potential removal proceedings and a three-year bar on readmissibility if he remained in the U.S. for more than 180 days after the denial. Balancing the equities and public interest, the court ordered that USCIS's decision denying Mr. Venkatraman's petition be stayed retroactively to February 14, 2020, and then vacated.

The asylum seeker was later reunited with her child and released from detention after passing a credible fear interview. She now seeks a declaratory judgment that the government's past conduct was illegal and unconstitutional, a permanent injunction against future separation, and compensatory and punitive damages from the former Attorney General and former ORR Director in their individual capacities for alleged constitutional violations. How should a U.S. federal court rule on these claims?", "golden_answer": "The U.S. federal court should grant the motions to dismiss the amended complaint and deny the motion for declaratory relief and permanent injunction. The claims against the individual capacity defendants (former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former ORR Director Scott Lloyd) seeking compensatory and punitive damages for alleged constitutional violations should be dismissed for failure to state a claim. This is because these claims would require recognizing a new implied constitutional cause of action under *Bivens*, which the Supreme Court disfavors, especially when the claims involve broad immigration policy decisions, alternative remedies are available, and Congress has extensively legislated on immigration matters. The claims against the official capacity defendants (various agencies and officials) seeking declaratory and injunctive relief should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to mootness. The plaintiff has been reunited with her son, released from detention, and the \"Zero Tolerance\" policy has been changed by Executive Order and largely enjoined by a nationwide preliminary injunction in a class action suit. Therefore, a declaratory judgment or permanent injunction would not presently affect the parties' rights or have a more-than-speculative chance of affecting them in the future. The voluntary cessation exception to mootness does not apply, as the reunification was not solely due to this litigation and it is \"absolutely clear\" that the challenged conduct is unlikely to reoccur given the changed circumstances and the class-wide injunction.

Global Innovations argues that USCIS misinterpreted the \"primarily engaged in basic research and/or applied research\" regulatory standard, that the administrative record did not support the denial, and that USCIS's denial inexplicably departed from numerous prior approvals for Global Innovations. Global Innovations also seeks to introduce supplemental evidence of these prior approvals and a declaration on its \"nonprofit\" status in another, unrelated petition. How would a federal court likely rule on these arguments and requests based on the provided case?", "golden_answer": "A federal court would likely deny Global Innovations' motion for summary judgment and grant USCIS's motion for summary judgment. The court would likely uphold USCIS's interpretation of \"primarily engaged\" to mean \"principally and as distinguished from incidentally or secondarily\" and \"directly engaged in\" (as opposed to merely \"promoting\") research, finding this interpretation unambiguous and supported by the regulation's text, structure, history, and purpose. The court would also likely find USCIS's factual determination, that Global Innovations failed to demonstrate it was primarily engaged in research, to be supported by the administrative record and not arbitrary or capricious. Furthermore, the court would likely deny the request to supplement the administrative record, as the pattern of prior approvals was acknowledged by USCIS, making additional evidence unnecessary to assess whether USCIS adequately explained its decision. Finally, the court would likely find that USCIS adequately explained its departure from prior approvals by providing a detailed analysis of the regulatory requirements and the insufficiency of the evidence in the current petition, noting that prior erroneous approvals do not create an automatic entitlement to future approvals.

The court found that USCIS's visa availability approach provides a rule of reason, there is no binding congressional timetable, and the investor's alleged financial risks and uncertainty do not rise to the level of harm considered under factors three and five. Furthermore, compelling USCIS to prioritize this petition would unfairly prejudice other applicants in the backlog, and no impropriety on the agency's part was plausibly alleged.

The application of the revised rule, which became effective on January 17, 2017, would strip plaintiff of that vested right, thus having an impermissible retroactive effect not authorized by Congress. The 2011 regulation mandated that USCIS either adjudicate EAD applications within 90 days of receipt or, failing that, grant an employment authorization document for a period not to exceed 240 days. The court rejected the government's interpretation that the 90-day clock does not start until a threshold determination on an underlying benefit has been made, finding it unsupported by the plain language of the regulation and contrary to legislative history indicating that U-visa applicants should be able to seek work authorization before final eligibility determination.

The Court found that the Plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits because they failed to establish the Court's jurisdiction.

Organizational Plaintiffs also lacked standing as they could not demonstrate that their members faced imminent injury or that immigration judges regularly denied requests for remote hearings or continuances. Furthermore, the Court determined that Defendants' policies were unlikely to constitute final agency action reviewable under the APA, and even if they were, the policies were not arbitrary and capricious, given the rapidly changing pandemic situation and the reasonable steps taken by the agencies.

The court would likely find that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously by \"entirely fail[ing to consider an important aspect of the problem,\" specifically disregarding the rule’s impact on legal service providers and their capacity to provide legal services to persons subject to removal proceedings. The court would determine that the agency was obligated to address these concerns as part of the notice-and-comment process, as Congress's concern for the availability of pro bono and low-cost legal services in removal proceedings is evident on the face of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The court would further find that the legal service providers' concerns were neither irrelevant nor speculative and that the agency's dismissal of them as such was a failure to respond to relevant and significant public comments. Additionally, the court would likely find that, absent equitable relief, the legal aid organization would suffer irreparable harm to its core mission, and that the balance of the equities and the public interest would favor staying the effective date of the portion of the rule related to direct representation fees.

{"case_name": "chang v. united states citizenship and immigration services", "question": "An investor applies for an EB-5 visa, having invested capital in a U.S. business through a limited partnership agreement. The agreement includes a \"call option\" that grants the general partner (the company) the choice to buy out the investor's interest at a specified price after certain conditions are met, but it does not provide the investor with any right to demand repayment of their capital. If U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) denies the investor's visa petition, asserting that this call option renders the investment a prohibited \"debt arrangement\" because the capital is not truly \"at risk,\" is USCIS's denial arbitrary and capricious?", "golden_answer": "Yes, USCIS's denial of the investor's Form I-526 petition would be arbitrary and capricious. A call option, which gives the company the choice to buy out investors but provides no right to repayment for the investors, does not constitute a prohibited \"debt arrangement\" under 8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e). Therefore, the investors' capital is considered \"at risk.\" The court found that USCIS's action conflicted with the plain language of its regulations, was not compelled by statutory or regulatory purpose, unreasonably stretched the rationale of Matter of Izummi, and ran counter to the evidence in the record.", "golden_context": ["8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(5)", "8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(5)(A)", "8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(5)(B)(ii)", "8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(5)(C)(i)", "8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(5)(C)(ii)", "8 U.S.C. § 1202(a)", "8 U.S.C. § 1186b(a)(1)", "8 U.S.C. § 1186b(c)(1)", "8 U.S.C. § 1186b(d)(2)(A)", "8 C.F.R. § 204.6(a)", "8 C.F.R. § 204.6(e)", "8 C.F.R. § 204.6(f)(2)", "8 C.F.R. § 204.6(g)(1)", "8 C.F.R. § 204.6(j)(2)", "8 C.F.R. § 103.3(c)"], "golden_case_context": ["chang v. united states citizenship and immigration services", "doe v. uscis", "blue ocean inst. v. gutierrez", "stuttering found. of am. v. springer", "fund for animals v. babbitt", "u.s. chamber of commerce v. sec", "motor vehicle mfrs. assn v. state farm mut. auto ins. co.", "dist. hosp. partners, l.p. v. burwell", "thomas jefferson univ. v. shalala", "christopher v. smithkline beecham corp.", "natl assn of mfrs. v. dept of def.", "ali v. fed. bur. of prisons", "united states v. gonzales", "nixon v. mo. mun. league", "auer v. robbins", "r.l. investment limited partners v. ins", "perez v. mortg. bankers assn", "fla. power & light co. v. lorion", "fox v. clinton"]}
